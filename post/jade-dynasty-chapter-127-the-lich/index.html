      <p>The flame clouds in the sky gradually darkened, and ahetai was hidden in the dark clouds, and quickly and incomparably far away from qilidong.</p>
<p>Half an hour later, when he was sure that no foreign people would follow him, he slowly fell down to the cloud, returned to the ground, and landed in a valley.</p>
<p>At the moment, both the Li and the Miao are in a state of failure. However, ahetai seems not eager to find the remaining Li people. He carefully looked at the black staff in his hand. A mysterious magic power was wandering in the black staff, which made the blood in the Li people reverberate gradually.</p>
<p>He can even imagine that in the future he will command Southern Xinjiang with a bone jade black stick. The great wizard with infinite scenery in the past will be himself tomorrow. As for the panicked clansmen at the moment, there is no need to worry too much. Anyway, the patriarch is determined to take revenge, so let him fight well. Otherwise, with this rude personality, he is afraid that he will still master the obstacle of Li nationality.</p>
<p>Ahotai smiles coldly and holds the bone jade black stick tightly in his chest. At this moment, he is no longer afraid. He didn&rsquo;t even pay attention to the demon who passed on his power. Although he asked himself that he was far from the rival of the demon king at the moment, he knew the origin and situation of the mysterious demon king as well as the great wizard. Without the collection of five sacred vessels of five ethnic groups in southern Xinjiang, the demon king would never have been resurrected from the &ldquo;magic cave&rdquo; in 100000 mountains.</p>
<p>At the thought that even the demon king, who was so frightened that the whole southern Xinjiang was shaking, was also playing with his fingers, ahatai was so excited that he could not bear it any longer and burst out laughing.</p>
<p>The sound echoed in the night sky, in the valley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the moment when he was laughing happily, there was a sudden burst of applause from the darkness on the other side of the valley. At the same time, a voice, deep and quiet, came over: &ldquo;how powerful, how powerful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ahotai&rsquo;s body shakes, and quickly turns to look, but there is only darkness. Without looking at anything carefully, he cried out, &ldquo;who is it? Stand up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the darkness, two red flames suddenly lit up. It was as big as a fight, and then there was a low gasping sound, like a beast growling in the dark.</p>
<p>A Hetai&rsquo;s face changed greatly.</p>
<p>But the two red flames did not move, and they just glared at ahatai in the dark. It&rsquo;s in front of the red fire. A man in black emerged from the darkness.</p>
<p>I saw that this man almost seemed to flow out of the dark. His whole body was covered with black clothes from head to foot. Only two eyes were left, which made him feel terrible. But seeing his body was stiff, he did not come out, but floated out of the air two feet above the ground.</p>
<p>He Tai&rsquo;s pupils contracted in his eyes, and his face was even more tense, as if he had seen a devil.</p>
<p>The man in Black said slowly, &ldquo;ahatai, you really live up to the expectation of the beast God. He took all the bone jade and the black stick</p>
<p>Ahetai subconsciously grabs the bone jade black stick more tightly. This action is seen in the eyes of the man in black. Behind him, the red fire in the two regiments of darkness seems to send out an angry roar.</p>
<p>The man in black raised his hand slightly, and the foreign body in the dark behind him calmed down a little. Then he said slowly, &ldquo;ahatai, it seems that you don&rsquo;t want to keep your promise to the God of beasts. Give us these two sacred objects</p>
<p>Ahetai&rsquo;s face was changeable and uncertain. It was obvious that the &ldquo;beast God&rdquo; existed in his heart with great terror, but several times he fought with his heart. Finally, greed prevailed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo; Ahetai showed a vicious expression and sneered: &ldquo;I have black stick and bone jade now. This is the holy instrument that beat all the beasts and demons to death. If you are not afraid of death, try it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man in black was silent for a moment and said slowly, &ldquo;so to speak. You are going to betray the God of beasts. &quot;</p>
<p>Ahetai only felt that the sorcery in his body was full of magic power. He could not help laughing and said, &ldquo;so what? Don&rsquo;t think I don&rsquo;t know. Without the sacred vessels of the five nationalities in southern Xinjiang, the monster can&rsquo;t be revived in the magic cave. If there is no him, even if you and the Dragon behind you, in front of my sacred instrument, what is it? Ha ha ha ha ha</p>
<p>…”</p>
<p>Two regiments of red fire behind the man in black gave out a low roar of &ldquo;ouao Ao Ao&rdquo;, obviously very angry. However, the man in black was very calm and looked at ahetai coldly and said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t forget, what is the origin of these five sacred vessels? You barbarians in southern Xinjiang, at most, only play their magic power. If not, even if you have an animal God preaching to you, how can you snatch it from that immortal Wizard of the Miao nationality? &quot;</p>
<p>His voice gradually lowered, and the meaning of his voice was even colder. He said, &ldquo;I will warn you for the last time not to fight against the God of beasts!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ahotai&rsquo;s heart did not know how, suddenly suddenly suddenly a moment, even he himself also felt that his body was shaking slightly. But a moment later, he held on to Guyu black stick again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go to hell!&rdquo; His eyes were wide open and he waved the black stick. In an instant, a black fire rushed out of the black stick and rushed to the man in black. Where it passed, it was scorched black.</p>
<p>The man in black snorted coldly, but he didn&rsquo;t see any action. Suddenly, the flame of black fire was blocked by invisible force three feet in front of him. However, there was no surprise in ahotai&rsquo;s expression. Obviously, it was just a test just now.</p>
<p>On the contrary, after the blow just now, he has confirmed his long-standing conjecture. Sure enough, these sacred utensils such as bone jade and black staff can play out the sorcery handed down to him by the beast demon ten times. If he wants to sacrifice such a black fire, he has to work hard for a long time, but now he can do it.</p>
<p>Thinking of this, ahetai is even more proud. How can he put the man in black in front of him in his eyes and laugh wildly again.</p>
<p>The man in black looked at the arrogant appearance of the opposite ahetai, and did not have any angry behavior. He only said faintly: &ldquo;Lord beast, you are sure to see clearly that you are a man with a sinister mind. Once you succeed, you will betray.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ahotai said grimly with a smile: &ldquo;so what? There are countless demons and ghosts with high sorcery power from the bottom of the monster cave, but who else can come out of it except you? Do you still want to take the sacred instrument from my hand with your weak conduct</p>
<p>The man in black looked at ahetai&rsquo;s wild face and suddenly made a smile. Without saying much, he reached into his arms and took out a thing.</p>
<p>Once this thing left the Lich&rsquo;s arms, it immediately sent out a faint halo. From a distance, it was a pearl with black light. In this dark night, if you don&rsquo;t take a careful look at it. I can&rsquo;t see clearly.</p>
<p>A Hetai looked at the bead a few times, but he couldn&rsquo;t help getting nervous. Although he was not afraid of the mysterious man in black, the Lich power was not so strong. However, he has always been one of the most important right-hand Assistants under the zombie seat. No one knows what mysterious magic he has.</p>
<p>While he was secretly thinking about whether to attack immediately and not to let the man in black do something strange, the man in black closed his hands and made a more eccentric action.</p>
<p>He palmed up.</p>
<p>With a crack, Shengsheng crushed the black bead. After a while, the debris fell from his palm like sand.</p>
<p>Ahotai was startled by his actions. He was alert and alert. He had heard of the Lich&rsquo;s ability to poison before. Only the mountain wind blows, the debris have gone with the wind, and the wind blows in the opposite direction. He waited for another moment, but nothing happened.</p>
<p>Ahotai laughed and said, &ldquo;what are you going to do? Whatever you want, how can you get me&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>His voice stopped abruptly, as if he had been blocked in his throat.</p>
<p>Almost at the same time, all of a sudden, a flash of fire lit up in the dark, illuminating the surroundings. It&rsquo;s bright. And the source of the fire was actually emitted from ahetai.</p>
<p>For a moment, just listen to &ldquo;poop, poop, poop&hellip;&rdquo; Continuous muffled sound, the body of ahotei. From inside to outside, a dozen rays of light shot out. At a glance, it was almost as if the body had been opened more than a dozen holes at the same time. It was both funny and terrifying.</p>
<p>Ah he can&rsquo;t say a word anymore. He opened his mouth and slowly raised his head with a look of fear and wonder on his face.</p>
<p>The man in black coldly floated in front of him and said slowly: &ldquo;the beast God knew you were unreliable. When the black fire was passed on to you, he deliberately left the&rdquo; black fire pearl &ldquo;. As long as you destroy the black fire essence bead, the power of black fire will definitely bite back on the master and make you die under the magic power handed down to you by the beast God Lord!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ahotei&rsquo;s eyes were full of fear and regret. He opened his mouth wide, but he only let out hoarse gasps. After a moment, a dull sound of &ldquo;poop poop&rdquo; came out continuously. The black fire roared out of his body, engulfed his whole body and burned up.</p>
<p>After a while, the ambitious man had been reduced to ashes.</p>
<p>Only bone jade black stick, still lying in the ashes.</p>
<p>The man in black floated over and put out his hand. Guyu black staff was sucked into his hands by the air. He sneered and was about to leave. Suddenly, he turned his head and looked at the dark place on the other side of the valley and said in a deep voice, &ldquo;who is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the dark, silent for a long time, only slowly out of a shadow, gray clothes and white beard, face wrinkles, awe inspiring is the burning incense Valley&rsquo;s superior policy.</p>
<p>At the moment, he looked at the man in black, and at the two red flames full of hostility behind him. Finally, his eyes fell on the bone jade black stick in the hands of the man in black.</p>
<p>He looked, like, suddenly, thirty years older.</p>
<p>The man in black obviously didn&rsquo;t expect to meet shangguance in this place. However, seeing his appearance, he was still familiar with shangguance. After the initial astonishment, the man in black was silent for a moment. Then he slowly said, &ldquo;we haven&rsquo;t seen each other for 80 years, old friend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wrinkles on Shangguan CE&rsquo;s face looked as deep as a knife: &ldquo;you,&rdquo; he said slowly, one word at a time. &ldquo;Finally, you can&rsquo;t help coming out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man in black was floating in the night wind, but his figure was motionless in the air. Like his voice, he said leisurely, &ldquo;Lord beast, I&rsquo;m impatient to wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shangguance said slowly: &ldquo;at the beginning, my elder martial brother Yunyi and Lanyun said to each other in front of the monster Lord&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man in black suddenly cut off: &ldquo;do you believe what your elder martial brother said?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shangguance suddenly stopped talking.</p>
<p>The man in black with a faint smile said: &ldquo;old friend, you and I are our own masters. The future is dangerous. Take care of yourself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, he put his black stick in his arms, and the whole person retreated. In a twinkling of an eye, he disappeared into the darkness.</p>
<p>Shangguance&rsquo;s eyes twitched and his body moved. It seemed that he wanted to do something. But in the darkness opposite, the two groups of red fire suddenly became blazing, and the roaring sound was fierce.</p>
<p>The voice of the man in black came from afar in the dark: &ldquo;my friend, you are far more profound than me. But I have a dragon, plus black stick bone jade, you can&rsquo;t stop me. You and I have known each other for many years, so I&rsquo;d better leave a little friendship with you. &quot;</p>
<p>Shangguance&rsquo;s body shape, abruptly stopped down. A moment later. The two red fires were also disappearing in the dark.</p>
<p>Between heaven and earth, he was left standing alone in the cold valley. After a long time, his long sigh came out.</p>
<p>the dim light of night. Deeper.</p>
<p>Qilidong, originally a prosperous and beautiful land, has now been submerged by the sea of fire, crying everywhere. The great wizard of the Miao nationality was seriously injured and his life and death were unpredictable. Ahetai, which the Li people had high hopes for, suddenly disappeared. Many foreigners came to qilidong, among them, a figure like a devil suddenly appeared.</p>
<p>In this case, the Li and Miao Nationalities had no desire to fight. The Li gradually withdrew from qilidong, while the Miao did not want to catch up with the wounded in their homes. At the same time, countless people looked at the foreigners who were still in qilidong with hostile eyes.</p>
<p>However, the attention of those people has never paid attention to the Miao people around them.</p>
<p>In their eyes, there was only the red and blue light fighting in mid air.</p>
<p>In this strange Valley, there is a trace of desolation, fighting for each other&rsquo;s life and death.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s Tianya blue light is getting more and more prosperous. It&rsquo;s like the sky is turning when she is waving. The earth is moving, the wind is fierce, and the ghosts change, and there is an unstoppable power.</p>
<p>Under the light of her sword. Vaguely see that resolute and haggard face, without a trace of expression, and between the starting hand, there is no mercy.</p>
<p>The wind of swords and swords, breaking through the sky and piercing sound, covered the world. From all sides of the frenzy to come and go.</p>
<p>With a wild laugh, he galloped in the rain of swords. His blood sucking beads were more like spirits. The excited red mansions were like evil spirits roaring in the sky and fighting with open teeth and claws.</p>
<p>The sword, like frost and snow, fluttered down, someone howled and went up against the sky.</p>
<p>Tianya eats blood,</p>
<p>Blood eating Tianya!</p>
<p>After the merciless magic weapon which makes the situation changeable, who&rsquo;s and what kind of eyes are followed?</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi did not know that the layers of waves such as waves, such as huge waves, such as ghosts crying, such as the blood sucking Red Mansions of demon howling, came suddenly, and the evil demon power almost made her whole body essence and blood to pour out.</p>
<p>Tianya is like snow. It turns into a giant sword to open the sky. It is chopped down and splits the mountain red awn in two. Lu Xueqi was shocked to the sky just by her figure. She walked lightly in the wind, her sword was waving, and her voice was sharp. In an instant, the storm gathered around her.</p>
<p>That hair is fluttering, caressing the white face, this is the color of jade face.</p>
<p>Take a deep breath.</p>
<p>She walked seven steps in a row, dancing like a fairy in the clouds. Without waiting for her to chant, the sky had already turned into a whirlpool, shaking violently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nine days of xuancha, into God thunder. Brilliant heavenly power, lead it with sword</p>
<p>Ancient incantation, once again mysterious echo in the sky, the white figure reflected in whose eyes, such as dancing lilies!</p>
<p>Ten years of time, in this volatile foreign land, in this place where heaven and earth change color, and where the wind and cloud gather, they emerge one by one.</p>
<p>The huge and deep whirlpool of darkness whirled rapidly in the sky, the lightning flickered and the wind howled. Lu Xueqi stood in the air, floating in white.</p>
<p>Qingyun gate&rsquo;s supreme magic &ldquo;magic sword against thunder&rdquo; is displayed in her hands in such a way that it has a myriad of features and incomparable power. At this moment, compared with the field in the first battle of Liubo mountain, the momentum is not weak.</p>
<p>All the people in the right path around him marveled, but this scene, falling in the eyes of ghosts and sharp, was an unknown shock.</p>
<p>Deep in the clouds, under the sword of Tianya, at the moment when the endless blue light was blooming, Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s figure had a faint trace of gold, which was solemn and weird.</p>
<p>This is not the way of Qingyun gate!</p>
<p>The fierce wind became more and more urgent, and the thought flashed away in his mind. In his heart&rsquo;s eyes, behind his wild laughter, what was left?</p>
<p>Cold eyes, looking down from the sky, behind the Red Mansions, that rebellious and evil figure.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s bright eyes were like frost, and she roared and roared all over the sky. It was like tearing up the heaven and earth.</p>
<p>In the depths of the clouds, countless electric lights quickly gathered and the sound of thunder exploded in the sky. In a moment, in the dark whirlpool, a huge electric light converged and fell into the sky and fell on the Tianya sword.</p>
<p>The dazzling light seemed to be in her hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good swordsmanship!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He burst out laughing, and the laughter was fierce. It was spread in the Red Mansions, straight like tearing the heart and cracking the lung.</p>
<p>That high white figure, peerless demeanor, after all, is so unattainable</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>At this moment, red, green and black are all controlled by evil forces. They are full of evil spirit. They are full of evil spirit and cry towards the sky.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s face is colder, the last hesitation in her eyes is finally broken.</p>
<p>Lightning roars, god Buddha, sing together!</p>
<p>In the distance, suddenly someone screamed.</p>
<p>He was so engrossed in guarding against the uncanny magic of the sky that he suddenly screamed behind him. He was startled and forced to move his body. With a &ldquo;poop&rdquo; sound, a flat sharp jade ruler came straight out of his right shoulder like an invincible magic weapon.</p>
<p>With a fierce roar, Li Xun turned his head and saw Li Xun holding a jade ruler in his hand and his face full of resentment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He roared up to the sky, and the bloody magic wand with endless red light fell down in an instant. Li Xun&rsquo;s eyes shrank, but he didn&rsquo;t show any fear. He used his right hand to &ldquo;hiss&hellip;&rdquo; The sound of the jade ruler will be drawn out, such as spring spray blood.</p>
<p>After the red mansions were hit, Li Xun fought hard. The Taoist method of burning incense valley was really extraordinary. In addition, he was seriously injured and hongmang was unstable. Under such a close distance, he was still blocked by Li Xun.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that the blood sucking bead is such a fierce thing, and it&rsquo;s also a blood refining evil treasure connected with the evil blood. In a moment, endless evil forces attack the jade ruler. Li Xun holds the right hand of Yuchi and withers at a visible speed under such incredible ghost power.</p>
<p>Li Xun was terrified and tried his best to earn it. However, GUI Li was nearly crazy at the moment. He reached for it with five fingers in his hand and grasped it on his right hand.</p>
<p>Li Xun felt a sharp pain and even a cold sweat came out. At the critical moment, a low Buddhist name and a sigh came from his side.</p>
<p>A soft golden light, solemn and peaceful, is the &ldquo;great Brahman Prajna&rdquo; of Tianyin temple!</p>
<p>The magic skill of Buddhism, and the power of blood sucking demons, were pushed away by his life.</p>
<p>Just taking advantage of this moment, FA Xiang grabbed Li Xun and quickly backed out. In his eyes, he was full of compassion and helplessness, looking at the figure of the man swaying in the wind.</p>
<p>The huge white light in the sky fell from the sky at this moment, and the extremely powerful and accurate pole hit the ghost! (to be continued. )</p>
