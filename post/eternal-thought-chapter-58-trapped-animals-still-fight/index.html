      <p>Rain night, thunder roaring, lightning across the sky, so that the sky and earth suddenly bright and dark, loud reverberation, beans big raindrops continue to fall on the earth, issued a loud sound.</p>
<p>From a distance, the whole world is shrouded in the rain, a blur, breeding boundless killing.</p>
<p>On the ground, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s body trembled and her eyes were red. She was exploding at full speed. Sometimes she stepped on the ground fiercely and suddenly jumped up. All the way, she was like a sharp arrow leaving the string and roared away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To live, we all need to Live! &quot; Bai Xiaochun shivered and kept saying this sentence. The figures of Du Lingfei and Hou Yunfei appeared in his mind.</p>
<p>The shadow of death came, as if melted with the rain, making the surrounding more and more cold.</p>
<p>Around him, at the moment, there are eight figures from various positions, who are pursuing him rapidly, especially Chen Heng. Although he is the farthest away, he is behind the crowd, but his speed is extremely fast. He is turning into a rainbow from afar, shuttling through the rain curtain all the way, faster and faster. The rain curtain in front of him actually sends out bursts of sound explosion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t escape. No one can escape from the array arranged by my ancestors of the Chen family!&rdquo; Chen Heng had a flash in his eyes.</p>
<p>Even he didn&rsquo;t expect that the outer disciples of Lingxi clan could escape so much. Now there are still a few days before they can even escape from the array range of their ancestors. Especially those who are being chased by themselves at the moment have good accomplishments and can kill Chen Yue. Not to mention, they also killed several Chen family members he brought along.</p>
<p>After all, this is one of the areas where Lu Tianlei and Lu Tianyou are in charge of the north shore. After all, he will not be in charge of the north bank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lingxi zongtianjiao&hellip;&rdquo; In Chen hengmu, there was even a faint sense of excitement.</p>
<p>The thunder roared, and Bai Xiaochun gritted his teeth and galloped. His breath was short, and the aura in his body was rapidly consumed. The heaven and earth were blurred, as if an ancient fierce beast opened its mouth and covered the four corners of the sky.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, Bai Xiaochun suddenly raised his head. In his blood colored eyes, he stood up fiercely. When he looked ahead, the rain suddenly fluctuated and a strong Bang came out, which broke countless raindrops and rushed straight to Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>Behind the rain, the first Luo Chen family member who attacked Bai Xiaochun appeared!</p>
<p>It was a middle-aged man with a scar on his face. The whole man looked very fierce. He had been cultivating himself for seven layers of condensation gas. Now he stepped forward. He held a huge Tomahawk in his right hand, such as a gust of wind. In the near moment, he roared with an axe in his hands, facing Bai Xiaochun with a fierce chop!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get the hell out of here!&rdquo; The voice of the middle-aged man exploded like thunder and reverberated everywhere.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s eyes were red, and his body did not stop at all. At the moment when the opponent&rsquo;s axe fell, he rushed to him, and his left hand suddenly lifted up and went directly to press the chopping axe!</p>
<p>The middle-aged man sneered and his hands condensed for more accomplishments, which made the axe set off a strong wind when it fell.</p>
<p>When Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s left hand was raised, the black light flashed, and the undead iron sheet broke out at this moment, which made his left hand look black, and instantly met with the axe.</p>
<p>With a bang, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s left hand grasped the edge of the axe. The force was so strong that the rain all around him rolled and splashed.</p>
<p>When the pain came, the blood was left, but the iron was strong, especially at the moment when Bai Xiaochun was fully deployed, so that although his palm had blood overflow, it did not break.</p>
<p>The middle-aged man frowned and pulled hard, but Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s hand was like a pair of tongs, and he firmly clasped the axe. The middle-aged man pulled it down and couldn&rsquo;t shake it.</p>
<p>This scene immediately changed the middle-aged man&rsquo;s face. When he looked up, what he saw was Bai Xiaochun, who was close to him. He was crazy in his eyes!</p>
<p>He had never seen this kind of madness in anyone, only in those desperate ferocious beasts in the falling star mountains.</p>
<p>This scene makes the middle-aged man&rsquo;s heart thump. Several protective lights appear all over his body. His hands do not hesitate to release the axe, and his body suddenly retreats.</p>
<p>He is quick, but Bai Xiaochun Faster!</p>
<p>When Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s left hand clasped the axe, his right hand appeared black as well. At the moment of lightning crossing the sky, his dark right hand directly appeared in front of the middle-aged man.</p>
<p>The moment is approaching, penetrating the protective light outside the man&rsquo;s body. When the sound of click reverberates, those protective lights are broken one by one. Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s right hand is overwhelming and penetrates everything in an instant. At this moment, it seems that under the extreme state of Bai Xiaochun, his broken throat lock is different from usual!</p>
<p>Unexpectedly There is a suction, burst out from his palm, making the middle-aged man back, a sudden meal, before he reacts, the world in front of him, has been completely replaced by the black of white Xiaochun&rsquo;s right hand!</p>
<p>Bang, white Xiaochun&rsquo;s right hand directly stuck in the middle-aged man&rsquo;s neck, the face of a fierce pinch!</p>
<p>Click!</p>
<p>In the middle-aged man&rsquo;s neck, his head was crushed, and even his head was crushed!</p>
<p>Even when he was dying, his eyes were full of horror. Although he knew that the other side was strong, he was always ready. He didn&rsquo;t want to kill the other party, but he wanted to stop and delay time. However, he didn&rsquo;t expect that the skinny Lingxi sect&rsquo;s outer disciple was so strong.</p>
<p>At the moment of the middle-aged man&rsquo;s death, there were two figures in the distance, approaching rapidly. One of them was the eighth layer of condensate like Chen Yue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chen Zhong Seeing the death of the middle-aged man, the two men suddenly roared with grief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You forced me Bai Xiaochun throws out the middle-aged man&rsquo;s body with a swing of his right hand. He is short of breath, his body shakes and changes direction again. His whole body trembles, but in his eyes, the meaning of violence is even stronger than before.</p>
<p>He knew that he could not be stopped, but his original intention was to lead the Luo Chen family away. Now he suddenly changed his direction. Where he went, he could see a continuous mountain range there.</p>
<p>The mountain range is not a boundary, so it is nameless. However, the vertical direction of the mountain range is not under the Luoxing mountain range, and even looks more majestic. What&rsquo;s amazing is that the rain from heaven and earth seems to incline more. Even the lightning and thunder are mostly concentrated there.</p>
<p>Looking up, you can also see that countless lightning connections have become a lightning ball, which is exploding with the rain.</p>
<p>With a cry, Bai Xiaochun ran away. The two members of the Luochen family were pursuing him. Even at this moment, we could see other members of the Luochen family from afar.</p>
<p>In particular, a long rainbow in the distance, like a piece of Lian, is also rapidly approaching Chen Heng.</p>
<p>As the clansmen of the Luochen family are approaching, Bai Xiaochun is getting closer and closer to the mountain jungle, which is less than dozens of Zhang. He is drenched all over. With a hard step on the ground, his body leaps away, and he is about to rush into the mountain jungle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop him!&rdquo; In the distance, Chen Heng heard a gloomy voice.</p>
<p>At this time, the two members of the Luochen family nearest to Bai Xiaochun, one of them, the man with the eighth floor of condensate, yelled, and grabbed the seven layers of condensate nearby. They looked at each other and knew each other&rsquo;s mind. The whole body of the seven layers of condensate immediately shrank together and became a ball. When the man of the eighth floor of condensate gas was thrown forward, he threw it hard.</p>
<p>With a bang, all the strength of cultivation was condensed. At this moment, the seven layers of condensed Qi, which had shrunk into a ball, suddenly increased their speed, whistling through the rain, and caught up with Bai Xiaochun in a blink of an eye.</p>
<p>As the moment approached, the cultivation of the seven layers of Qi was suddenly unfolded. When the killing came, the loud noise reverberated. Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s body stopped. When he turned around, he pinched a finger and the wooden sword roared away. However, the people of the Luochen family ignored life and death and allowed the wooden sword to penetrate his body. At the moment of death, his mouth showed a strange smile.</p>
<p>His body exploded with a bang, turned into countless flesh and blood, into a flesh and blood rope, to entangle Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>As soon as Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s face changed, his body immediately retreated. But at the moment when he was distracted and retreated, a sharp voice of breaking the sky suddenly came from behind him. It was an arrow!</p>
<p>It was the man with eight layers of gas that shot out. He had a big bow in his hand. At the moment, the bow string was still shaking.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the crucial moment that Bai Xiaochun can&rsquo;t dodge. It&rsquo;s very ingenious to cooperate with the seven layers of condensate people who are willing to die before!</p>
<p>At the moment of crisis, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s eyes flashed. His body was forced to stop, as if he was actively approaching the coming arrow.</p>
<p>With a cry, this sharp arrow that raised the sound of breaking the sky fell directly on Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s body. The sharp pain came, and Bai Xiaochun was pale.</p>
<p>When the arrow passed through his right scapula, it was stuck by a bone like a coincidence. The arrow was made of excellent material, and it was fired from eight layers of condensation gas. It was extremely powerful. After being stuck by the bone, it flew out with a thin white Xiaochun, avoiding the entanglement of the flesh and blood rope!</p>
<p>Oh, yes!</p>
<p>With Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s body, this arrow stabbed at a big tree at the edge of the jungle, nailing Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s body to the top!</p>
<p>Not far away, the eight layers of Congqi people who shot this arrow showed ecstasy in their eyes, and their body shook. As they approached rapidly, they opened their bows with their right hands to shoot out the second arrow with the potential to kill Bai Xiaochun!</p>
<p>In the distance, other members of the Luochen family also showed their cruelty one by one, whistling close. But at this time, Chen Heng, who was rapidly approaching, changed his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be careful!&rdquo;</p>
