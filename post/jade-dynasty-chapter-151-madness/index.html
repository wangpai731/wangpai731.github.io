      <p>Huqi mountain is the main hall of ghost king.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Squeak, squeak!&rdquo; Xiao Hui&rsquo;s familiar cry sounded in the deep passage, and came out of the shadow. On his shoulder, Xiao Hui took the big wine bag and drank a few drinks. Then he cleverly tied up the mouth of the wine bag and dropped it down. There is a long and thin rope on the big wine bag, which is tied to the monkey like a condom. It is not afraid that it will fall down.</p>
<p>With a grim face and no expression, she walked forward and saw that the direction was exactly the ice stone room where Biyao was. Xiaohui seemed to be a little sleepy, lying on his shoulder and yawning. Huqi mountain is desolate, and there are not many wild fruits. When Xiao Hui came back here, she could only steal some wine from the cellar of the ghost king. She didn&rsquo;t come down for a few days. It seemed that she was getting fatter.</p>
<p>GUI Li walked slowly, but he seldom met ordinary disciples of Guiwang sect. He frowned slightly. These days, many disciples of Guiwang sect were gathered and led out of the mountain by ghost king himself a few days ago. As for the whereabouts, he was not clear about it. What was strange was that he, the vice patriarch, did not know about this seemingly important thing. However, Youji and Mr. GUI who had been following the ghost king for many years, including Taoist Cangsong, who had just joined the ghost King sect, as well as many elite people and things he knew, all stayed in huqishan.</p>
<p>The ghost king is so mysterious. Although there are many people, but the strength is only about half of the ghost King&rsquo;s clan. Where is he going? There was also some confusion in his mind. However, Mr. GUI and Youji kept silent, and GUI Li naturally didn&rsquo;t talk much. What he cared about most was not where the ghost king was going or how important the matter was. In his opinion, Biyao was always the first.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s now, very quickly, in front of the iceberg.</p>
<p>There is no one at the door, and you Ji is not here. Usually, the place where you often see this mysterious woman is the ice stone room. However, it seems that the atmosphere in the ghost King&rsquo;s clan is quite wrong, and she has come here less often.</p>
<p>GUI Li stood at the door for a while and calmed down. Then he opened the door and went in. As soon as he entered the door, he saw a white and slim figure standing next to Biyao. He was stunned. At first, he thought it was Youji. But then, you Ji always wears black clothes, which is not her. Sure enough, when the woman in front heard the sound of the stone gate and turned her head, her face was not covered with black veil.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Xiaobai.</p>
<p>He was slightly surprised.</p>
<p>Since the great wizard failed to perform the &ldquo;summon the soul&rdquo; spell, he left huqishan heartbroken and returned here. He never saw Xiaobai again. Although he knew from the scene that the ghost king and Xiaobai met each other in those days, he knew that Xiaobai and the ghost King were old acquaintances, but he had no intention of asking about it.</p>
<p>At the moment, Xiaobai saw the ghost, and his face was slightly stunned. Then he showed a faint smile and said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After all, GUI Li had a friendship with Xiaobai, and Xiaobai had instructed him in saving Biyao. He still had some gratitude in his heart. He nodded and said, &ldquo;hello.&rdquo; At this time, lying on the shoulder of the monkey Xiaohui also cheerfully toward Xiaobai squeak twice.</p>
<p>Xiaobai smiles at Xiaohui, then looks at GUI Li and says, &ldquo;are you coming to see Biyao?&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li walked up slowly, and the beautiful and peaceful face of Biyao appeared in front of him again. His voice gradually sank down and said, &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaobai quietly watched the man sit down beside Biyao, and then looked at the body lying on the ice stone platform, motionless. She sighed softly. Shaking his head, quietly back out of the stone room, leaving only one person Guili face Biyao.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how long it took. The heavy stone door just opened again, ghost Li slowly walked out of the cold stone room, looked at the past look as if haggard a few minutes. He had just stepped out of the stone chamber and had not taken a few steps. On the passage not far from the stone chamber, the white figure of Nine Tailed sky foxes stood patiently there.</p>
<p>Xiaobai looks at him. With a sigh, he said, &ldquo;you must be very sad to see the appearance of Biyao. It&rsquo;s really hard for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ok,&rdquo; he said</p>
<p>Xiaobai came to him, patted him on the shoulder and whispered, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t be discouraged. There is always hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Guili body a shock, turned to look at her, slightly open mouth, but Xiaobai see his look, has preempted a bitter smile: &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t ask me, I don&rsquo;t know how to do now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly, his face darkened. He turned around in silence. He just wanted to take a step. Suddenly, there was a buzz in his mind. Suddenly, he felt that the whole body was cold, and the cold air in his body suddenly rose.</p>
<p>The fright of GUI Li was quite remarkable. At the moment, the cold breath that made strange things in his body was the power that he was very familiar with to eat blood beads. But in the past, especially after he had practiced the three volumes of Tianshu Zhenfa and made great progress, this cold breath was gradually restrained by him and stopped acting as a monster. I don&rsquo;t know how it happened today, and suddenly it burst out like this.</p>
<p>In less than a moment, in Xiaobai&rsquo;s startled eyes, the blood color on his face was completely lost. It seemed that there was a layer of frost on his face. Moreover, within three feet of his body, he was gradually covered by a strange dark green light, which had a faint smell of fierce blood.</p>
<p>Xiaobai&rsquo;s face changed color, just reached out to help the ghost, but as soon as his hand touched the dark green light, he only felt a demon sucking force rushing towards him from the strange awn. Xiaobai frowned tightly and retreated three steps, which avoided the evil force. The little ash, who had been lying on his shoulder, had already found something wrong. He jumped out of the body early and fell behind Xiaobai. He opened his three eyes and looked at the master.</p>
<p>His face was full of pain, and his sleeve suddenly moved. A cold breath flashed through his sleeve. The magic wand slipped out and did not fall to the ground. It floated in front of him and slowly rotated. It seemed that he was gazing at the man who had him for many years with strange and cold eyes.</p>
<p>The flickering dark green awn is unsteady, and the air is full of weird atmosphere. The small white face is pale and the brow is tight. But this blood eating Demon power is actually emitted from the ghost and fierce body. Even if I want to help the ghost and remove the sudden Demon power, the root is in the ghost Li&rsquo;s own body. How can I start? For a moment, Xiaobai was at a loss.</p>
<p>At the moment when GUI Li&rsquo;s face became more and more pale, and it seemed that he could not breathe, suddenly, a warm pure Yang red light was emitted from his chest, which immediately counteracted the cold demon&rsquo;s power. His face moved, and he tried to sit down. The golden light and blue color on his face flashed at the same time, under the urging of the two dharmas of the right way in his body. The pure Yang fire of &ldquo;xuanhuojian&rdquo; became more and more vigorous, and gradually suppressed the cold breath of Yin. However, it was half an hour later when the ghost completely recovered.</p>
<p>At the moment, the whole body has been completely wet. When he opened his eyes, what he saw was Xiaobai&rsquo;s caring eyes.</p>
<p>Grimly and bitterly smile for a while, but did not say anything, slowly stood up.</p>
<p>Xiaobai looked at him and said in a low voice, &ldquo;is it blood sucking beads?&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li picked up the ghost eating wand that fell on the ground when he didn&rsquo;t know when. He took a deep look at it, and then he took it back to his sleeve again.</p>
<p>Little white eyes a jump, suddenly step forward, way: &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t think don&rsquo;t say others don&rsquo;t know. Now, the evil force of blood sucking beads has begun to bite back at you. In the past ten years, the Qi, blood, essence and blood in your body have become cool and poisonous because of being with this evil thing day and night. Now you can escape from death, but you are lucky to get the XuanHuo Jian, one of the few magic weapons in the world that can compete with blood sucking beads. But&hellip; &quot; Her face seems a little bleak, even the voice has become vicissitudes, &ldquo;but, you are sure to escape several times, next time, you can escape past?&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li was standing there all the time. There was no expression on his haggard face. He listened to Xiaobai quietly. After a long time, he whispered, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure. But what can I do? &quot;</p>
<p>Little white white white tooth bit lip, angry way: &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t pretend to be silly with me, you will not know? Now only immediately discard this evil object, and then you take XuanHuo to a place of extreme Yang, and urge XuanHuo to identify pure Yang into the body. That&rsquo;s the only way for you to live! &quot;</p>
<p>GUI Li looked at Xiaobai for a long time, and then he suddenly gave a smile. The smile looked like an incredible innocence, just like the simple youth of Qingyun ten years ago.</p>
<p>Then, he slowly turned around, as if out of force, slowly supporting the wall to walk, small ash immediately ran to the master, three times twice to the top of the ghost&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
<p>Xiaobai stares at that resolute but at the same time reveals his fragile back, and suddenly says in a loud voice, &ldquo;do you want to die, do you want to die at all, right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His body stopped for a moment, but he didn&rsquo;t look back or speak. After a moment, he continued to walk forward.</p>
<p>Xiaobai&rsquo;s voice came from behind him: &ldquo;do you want to die? Don&rsquo;t dream! How many people in this world you owe have not been paid off, just want to die, impossible! You don&rsquo;t listen to me, do you? OK, you&rsquo;re good. I&rsquo;ll go by myself. I&rsquo;ll find the secret of the eight fierce XuanHuo array and let you save yourself.</p>
<p>You remember, Biyao is still lying in the cold stone room. Before she wakes up, you can&rsquo;t help dying if you want to!&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, no, no&hellip;&rdquo; In the long and secluded passage, there was a faint echo in the distance. His face was bleak and his body was slowly straightened up, but he did not look back again.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Dense forest, quiet valley, snake Valley in the morning was originally a quiet and peaceful place, but at this moment, the earth is shaking gradually, the smell is getting heavier and heavier. The innumerable poisonous snakes that originally gathered and swam around the edge of the valley suddenly disappeared, as if they had sensed something. All these animals were hiding.</p>
<p>A piece of black smoke and dust appeared in the distance of the valley, and quickly rushed to the direction of the snake valley. The strong and choking breath came from the air, and the growing roar gradually converged into a roar of mountains and seas!</p>
<p>Closer and closer!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roar ah ah ah ah&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are countless monsters, such as evil spirits and fierce spirits rushing out from Jiuyou hell, blood red eyes, sharp fangs and sharp roars. All kinds of strange monsters and monsters converged into an unstoppable torrent. In front of this vicious torrent, no one can stop and survive. Even the forest trees on the two sides of the road were quickly engulfed by the torrent in the roar of the earthquake.</p>
<p>Without hesitation or pause, the torrent directly rushed into the poisonous snake Valley, such as the black tide rushing into the green sea in an instant. In every corner of the forest, there were constantly frightened poisonous snakes being thrown out and struggling in the torrent in despair, but without exception, they were instantly submerged. Even the strange poisonous mist in the forest could not stop the terrible monster torrent. More than a dozen monsters in the front fell to the ground and died. However, more and more monsters rushed unstoppably on the corpses of their companions. The powerful hurricane soon scattered the colored poisonous fog over the forest.</p>
<p>In the black monster torrent, there are four or five powerful monsters which are dozens of times larger than ordinary monsters. He ran down with his teeth and claws. At the entrance of poisonous snake Valley, there are still countless monsters coming.</p>
<p>The whole snake Valley seemed to be shivering at the moment. Everything looks like the end of the world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s on the other end of snake valley.</p>
<p>Standing high, the ghost King breathed deeply. Although he had seen the beast demon&rsquo;s power, he was still changed by the scene. He settled down and pondered for a moment. Looking at the forest in the north of poisonous snake Valley, in the early morning sun, there was a faint reflection in the forest.</p>
<p>Ghost King&rsquo;s mouth slowly emerged a trace of sneer: one day, you will all know, who is the final winner?</p>
<p>He roared in his heart, his face gradually became stiff, and Biyao was no longer there, so let&rsquo;s use the world to make up for it!</p>
<p>He turned slowly and was in the dense forest behind him. They are the disciples of the ghost King sect. They stand full of woods with high fighting spirit. The ghost king looked at these people in front of him, with countless eyes fixed on his face.</p>
<p>At that moment, who knows his mood?</p>
<p>The arm that rises slowly seems to become heavy. The distant roar and panic call seem to reach here. The face of the ghost king suddenly changes again, and then. He heaved his arm down heavily.</p>
<p>The arm is like a knife, like a blade to the world, to cut off the last warmth, to tear up the dream. The sound of the arm in the wind seemed to be a fracture in the chest!</p>
<p>Countless people, in his majestic behind, issued a passionate cry, held up the sharp blade in their hands and rushed down the mountain with their lapels flying. Strong wind blowing, the trees in the forest swaying, seems to be dancing for this. The ghost king stood in the crowd tide, such as hard and cold rock motionless, he turned to the forest in the north, where the forest was also a commotion, gradually spread away.</p>
<p>The ghost King laughed, and suddenly he laughed wildly in the sea of dead people. The laughter was so harsh that no one dared to ask him a word. Only the sunshine just rising in the morning still rushed to the crazy world with a faint warmth!</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Seven days later, entrusted by daoxuan Zhenren, master Puhong and Yun Yilan, the orthodox disciples from Qingyun Mountain arrived in the southwest. Because of the importance, the three schools have sent their most effective disciples, as if by coincidence, these people have known each other for a long time.</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai, Lin Jingyu and Lu Xueqi of Qingyun gate, FA Xiang and FA Shan of Tianyin temple, Li Xun and Yan Hong of burning incense Valley, and a group of seven people set out from Qingyun Mountain. They walked cautiously all the way, avoiding conflicts with the monsters on the road, and rushed to the Southwest at full speed, hoping to find out why a large number of demon monsters suddenly came to this place.</p>
<p>When these righteous disciples were just on the road, although they knew that the trip was very dangerous, none of them wanted to retreat for the sake of the world. However, on the seventh day after their trip, all the people were pale and silent all day and night, including Xiao Yicai, who was the best speaker, FA Xiang behind him, and even Li Xun, who had always wanted to talk to Lu Xueqi all the way.</p>
<p>On a journey of a thousand miles, the further south we go, the more tragic the situation will be. Either the whole village is full of corpses and bones, or the villages one by one are deserted and the fertile fields turn into scorched earth. No one knows why these monsters even set fire to them, why they are so cruel to eat blood, just as no one knows when this catastrophe will end?</p>
<p>The faint ghost sounds, as if forever reverberates in the southern land wilderness, narrates the sad and miserable past.</p>
<p>After entering the southwest region, they were more cautious, but they were now facing a great problem. First of all, they could not find the local residents. All the people either fled to the north before the arrival of the beast demons, or they had been killed in the catastrophe. Therefore, these righteous disciples could not find the local people to inquire about the direction of these monsters. On the other hand, most of the monsters are not conversant with human beings. Even if they have ventured to catch a few monsters, most of them are roaring and struggling. Where can they ask?</p>
<p>In desperation, after a group of discussions, they finally had to follow Xiao Yicai&rsquo;s suggestion and secretly follow the demon. Where the more monsters gather, they will go. What are these monsters doing? In this way, they followed them for three days and three nights in Southwest China, during which they were almost discovered by some animal spirits with keen sense of smell and hearing. Fortunately, Xiao Yicai, FA Xiang and Lin Jingyu were all extremely intelligent figures, and they were in a critical moment of life and death. He dodged without danger. But for all that, they still didn&rsquo;t get much.</p>
<p>Just when they began to lose heart, they found a crazy demon disciple in a forest where the demon passed by, and asked them carefully. Or it can be said that under the patient coaxing, gradually knew that the beast demon entered the southwest of China, and actually had a big war with the demon sect, and the result of the battle was that the demon won the whole victory, and almost all the three big sects of the demon sect who were once arrogant were completely destroyed in this war.</p>
<p>This news immediately let everyone be startled to be stunned, and among the people, Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s face, especially pale, stood in the farthest distance!</p>
<p>Watch this one shrink into a ball. The poor man, who kept saying &ldquo;monsters, monsters&rdquo; in his mouth, even shivered suddenly from time to time to frighten the screaming madman. The hearts of the righteous seven were covered with a heavy shadow.</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai coughed, looked at FA Xiang and said, &ldquo;brother FA Xiang, we have a clear understanding of the current situation. What do you think we should do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>FA Xiang frowned and looked at the poor man on the ground and sighed. &ldquo;Amitabha, sin, sin.&rdquo; After a pause, FA Xiang said slowly. &ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen, the purpose of our trip is generally known now. I think that we should go back to the mountain first and report the current situation to several teachers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly. A cold voice came out from the side. People were shocked. The speaker was the most silent Lu Xueqi. FA Xiang was a little surprised and said, &ldquo;sister Lu, do you have any other opinions? Please tell me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s face was still very pale, but her voice was extremely calm. She said faintly: &ldquo;everything we know now is from the mouth of the demon sect disciple who has already been scared crazy. Moreover, when he spoke just now, he was confused and tossed about. Many places were guessed by ourselves. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s appropriate to think that we have completed the tasks assigned by the teachers. &quot;</p>
<p>FA Xiang was silent, and everyone looked at each other. After a moment, FA Xiang nodded his head and said, &ldquo;yes, sister Lu is right. It was the monk who was too anxious just now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai pondered for a moment and then said, &ldquo;there is some truth in what Lu said, but we have been exploring southwest China day and night for a long time, but we have no clue at all. Do we have to do this in the future?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s mouth moved, but she didn&rsquo;t say anything. Obviously, she couldn&rsquo;t think of any good solution to the current dilemma. But at this time, Li Xun, who always looked at Lu Xueqi from time to time, suddenly took a step forward and said, &ldquo;I have a way. Maybe I have some hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everyone was surprised. Even Lu Xueqi looked at Li Xun a few more times. FA Xiangxi said happily, &ldquo;seriously, elder martial brother Li, please tell me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li Xun took a deep breath and let himself not look at Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s eyes. He said, &ldquo;I listened to this madman carefully just now. I heard him say a place name called&rdquo; poisonous snake Valley &ldquo;several times. Do you have any attention</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai nodded and said, &ldquo;yes, I noticed. I have heard of this poisonous snake Valley before. It is said that it is a valley in the deep mountains of Southwest China. There are countless poisonous snakes gathered in it. There is also poisonous miasma in the forest. No one dares to enter the forest until the middle man dies. After a long time, no one knows the exact location of this valley any more. &quot;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu suddenly said: &ldquo;elder martial brother Li, do you think that the war between the demon and the demon sect is carried out in the legendary snake Valley?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li Xun nodded his head and said: &ldquo;yes, I can infer that the decisive battle took place in the poisonous snake valley. What&rsquo;s more, I think this poisonous snake Valley may be the general Hall of one of the three major sects of the demon sect. As long as we can find it, we can find out whether the madman is really saying it or not</p>
<p>Yan Hong, who has been silent for a long time, suddenly said: &ldquo;but elder martial brother, it has been many days. We will not say whether we can find the poisonous snake Valley at this moment. Even if we find it, the scene there may not be able to maintain its original appearance&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li Xun said coldly: &ldquo;younger martial sister, do you forget that those cruel monsters do set fire to eat people, but after setting fire, there will also be ruins. Animal demons eat people, but they don&rsquo;t eat bones!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s faces changed. After hearing this, Yan Hong&rsquo;s face turned pale, and she suddenly felt nauseous and vomited. Obviously, all the tragic things they saw along the way made this woman gradually reach the psychological limit.</p>
<p>Li Xun sighed and stopped talking. FA Xiang and FA Shan recited the names of Buddha in a low voice at the same time. Xiao Yi shook her head and went to Yan Hong and comforted her in a low voice. When Yan Hong&rsquo;s expression gradually settled down, he turned around and walked slowly to the demon sect disciple who was still shivering on the ground and squatted down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know where snake Valley is?&rdquo; Xiao Yicai tried his best to soften his voice. It sounded kind of friendly. But the demon sect disciple&rsquo;s body shook, but he buried his head lower and said nothing. Xiao Yicai asked three times in a row, but the demon sect disciple seemed to be deaf and had no reaction.</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai slowly stood up and looked at the crowd. No one spoke. Xiao Yicai sighed and said, &ldquo;what should I do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li Xun, standing on one side with a frown, suddenly strode to the demon sect disciple, picked him up, and asked in a loud voice, &ldquo;where are the places where those monsters kill people?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The demon cult disciple&rsquo;s body was shocked. In an instant, his face showed a look of extreme fear. He opened his mouth wide. After a moment, he gave out a sharp scream. But Li Xun, like a stone hearted man, held on tightly and cried out: &ldquo;where are the places where the monsters kill and eat people?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The demon sect disciple, who was deeply in fear, trembled all over his body, his teeth were bouncing and rattling, and his eyes were full of fear, but his head could not help looking north. Li Xun&rsquo;s eyes congealed and said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s in the north, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The demon sect disciple&rsquo;s head suddenly tilted, and his whole body softened. The people were shocked and rushed to check. However, the pupil of this person was enlarged. When he put his nose in, his breath was gone, and he was dead.</p>
<p>Li Xun slowly put down his body, stood up and faced the north. Everyone followed his eyes. Although it was a clear day, it seemed that there was a bloody cloud over it. (to be continued. )</p>
