      <p>&ldquo;A hundred years ago, the evil cult was rampant and powerful, and the way to eliminate demons was strong. Under the arrogance of the demons, they invaded Qingyun when they wanted to smooth the way. After a fierce battle, the ancestors of our ancestors fought hard. At the foot of Qingyun Mountain, please use the ancient sword to kill the immortals, and sacrifice the &ldquo;Zhuxian sword array&rdquo;. Finally, we turned the defeat into victory. &quot;</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue&rsquo;s tone is flat, but Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s face is slightly changed. With that sentence of &ldquo;fierce fighting&rdquo;, you can imagine the fierce and cruel war in those years.</p>
<p>However, master Shuiyue didn&rsquo;t seem to want to do so. He quickly went on: &ldquo;after the war, although the evil cult was severely damaged, I was also very weak. Many of our ancestors died and were injured. There was no spare time to pursue them. But at this time, a senior brother stood up and volunteered to kill the evil cult The remaining evils. &quot;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi moved in her heart and said, &ldquo;this master is the master of ten thousand swords?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue slowly closed his eyes, and his voice also gradually became a little flustered, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s him. Alas I can still remember the scene that day: in that fierce battle, he had already made great achievements and killed countless enemies. His white clothes were all dyed red. He stood in front of all the teachers with an excited look, but only a few words Let us these young younger martial brothers and sisters have a lot of blood. After that, except for elder brother daoxuan, who was a senior disciple and stayed at Qingyun, I, younger martial sister Su Ru, Tian Buyi, Zeng Shuchang, Shang Zhengliang, Tianyun, Cangsong, and so on, all followed him. From then on, they went to the wilderness, and on the way, they never fear to retreat. &quot;</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue&rsquo;s eyes were still closed, and her facial expression was so focused that it seemed to be in front of her eyes, re presenting the hot youth of that time, even on both sides of her cheek. There is a slight red.</p>
<p>There was no one talking in the hut for a moment, but the atmosphere seemed agitated. It&rsquo;s like a dark torrent under calm, passing silently.</p>
<p>For a long time, master Shuiyue suddenly gave a bitter smile and shook his head. His voice turned to desolation. &ldquo;Well, these old things are over. At that time, our party went through the disaster and severely damaged the remaining evils of the demon sect, and then we returned to Qingyun. But at this time, we were involuntarily involved in a secret of our door.</p>
<p>&quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After returning to Qingyun, younger martial sister Su Ru and Tian are not easy to get along with each other for a long time, but I really don&rsquo;t like this person. One night, they secretly hide from your master Zhenyu and run out, and I find out. If you are worried about the younger martial sister&rsquo;s loss, you are not willing to report them. Otherwise, if your master gets angry, she will suffer, and she will follow her all the way. &quot;</p>
<p>When Lu Xueqi heard this, she was surprised and amused, but she didn&rsquo;t dare to show it on her face.</p>
<p>Fortunately, master Shuiyue seemed to know that he had just stopped here and said, &ldquo;who knows they are young and courageous. In order to avoid people&rsquo;s eyes and ears, they even made an appointment to slip to the back mountain of Tongtian peak and went to have a tryst near the ancestral hall, which is rarely visited. &quot;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi was stunned again. After a long time, she lowered her head in silence. It&rsquo;s not easy to see the first field in Dazhu peak. It&rsquo;s true that people can&rsquo;t be judged by their appearance.</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue&rsquo;s face was restless, and he snorted, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m really angry when I look at them. He came out and stopped them. Sister Su and Tian Buyi were naturally shocked. When they saw that I was the only one, she came over to pull me with a smile. Tian Buyi didn&rsquo;t give me a good look. I was so angry that I was about to break out&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi secretly said in her heart: if Uncle Tian Bu Yi still has a good face and a smiling face at the moment, it will be strange. However, master Shuiyue stopped suddenly and asked, &ldquo;what happened later?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue was silent for a moment and said: &ldquo;at this moment, suddenly, from the originally desolate and dark ancestral hall, a strange roar came out. The sound was like the roar of wild animals, full of pain, almost not like the voice of human beings. Frightened, the three of us subconsciously hid in the shadow of the dense woods. A moment later, we saw the one The secret. &quot;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi looked at master Shuiyue closely, but she saw a faint pain on her face. I think the secret has been tormented for many years in her heart. Even now, it seems that the edges and corners have not been worn away.</p>
<p>Shuiyue master&rsquo;s low voice, sounds a bit empty, but that word by word, but as if landing thunderbolt, slowly opened the dust laden past.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A figure came crashing out of the ancestral hall. His clothes were in tatters and his hair was scattered. He could not see his face clearly. Moreover, he looked like a madman. At the same time, he kept shouting, sometimes suffering * *, but he could not understand what he was saying. The three of us were frightened and afraid. How could such a crazy person appear in such important places as ancestral hall? But you can&rsquo;t just let him do this. When the three of us just wanted to stop the madman, suddenly, two figures were swept out of the ancestral hall and fell in front of the madman like figure. All of us knelt down. That night, the moon was bright, and the three of us could see clearly. These two were the two elder martial brothers, daoxuan and wanjian one, whom we young people usually respect very much. &quot;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi lost her voice and said, &ldquo;what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue looked at her and said, &ldquo;are you surprised? At that time, the three of us, the share of shock only than you have, and no less than, were scared to stay in a daze. Then it was even more incredible. Elder martial brother daoxuan and elder martial brother Wan were both full of grief. They actually knelt on the ground, one on one side, each holding on to the madman&rsquo;s leg. They held on to each other&rsquo;s legs. Their voices were earnestly pleading, but what they were calling out for was master&rsquo;s word&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi at this time, is already surprised voice can not make out.</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue seemed to have been completely immersed in the past. He said in a low voice: &ldquo;we were shocked by their call, but we found out that the madman&rsquo;s figure and appearance was actually the master of Qingyun sect at that time, the mentor of these two elder martial brothers, and the great master of tianchengzi, who just made great achievements in the Zhengmo war not long ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The elder martial brother looked at us with tears, but he didn&rsquo;t look at the master&rsquo;s words. All these words are &ldquo;master wake up, master wake up.&rdquo; but the headmaster and master do not know why, with his practice. However, he was confused and turned a deaf ear to the entreaties of his two most proud disciples. At the end of the day, he turned around and his eyes flashed with fierce light. Staring at the two men, he yelled, and he hit them with both hands. &quot;</p>
<p>When Lu Xueqi heard this, she felt as if she was on the scene. She couldn&rsquo;t help shaking herself.</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue said: &ldquo;at that time, the three of us were peeping on the side, and we were already in a mess. At the moment, we saw the headmaster&rsquo;s face suddenly turned over and poisoned the two elder martial brothers. We were all at a loss. Who knew that they were going to die under the master of tianchengzi. All of a sudden, elder martial brother daoxuan turned around with the leader&rsquo;s leg. The whole person quickly and incomparably turned to master tianchengzi&rsquo;s back. Like lightning, he had already clasped his arms. At the same time, his whole body was bright and bright, and he firmly controlled him. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems that elder martial brother Wan didn&rsquo;t expect that elder martial brother daoxuan would be like this. He was stunned for a moment. Unexpectedly, although the elder martial uncle tianchengzi was in a frenzy, he was still holding his hands. However, he kicked elder martial brother Wan out of the room immediately, and he flew two feet straight, and a mouthful of blood gushed out. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At this time, the scene changed violently. All three of us seemed to be stupid, just staring at it, and we didn&rsquo;t know how to deal with it. Elder martial brother daoxuan cried out: &ldquo;younger martial brother Wan, don&rsquo;t you do it yet?&rdquo; After hearing this, elder martial brother Wan was obviously shaking, but he was still motionless. His eyes were fixed on his master and senior brother daoxuan. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master tianchengzi&rsquo;s Taoism is profound, and he tries to fight back. Although elder martial brother daoxuan still clasps his hands on his master&rsquo;s body, his face is flushed, and he has sprayed several mouthfuls of blood. At the same time, the blue light on his body is extremely dim. It is obvious that there is a gap between his Taoism and his master tianchengzi. At this moment, elder martial brother daoxuan was about to hold on. Suddenly, a white shadow drifted by. It was elder martial brother wan The three of us were stupefied and watched helplessly. Elder martial brother Wan let out a roar. After a sharp roar, he already had his dragon chopping sword in his hand, which pierced into the chest of the elder martial uncle tianchengzi! &quot;</p>
<p>In the hut, the silence of death seems to be like that desolate night, the silence after the tragic change, and the residual pain after the violent killing.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi was pale. After a long time, she murmured: &ldquo;it is recorded in the gate that tianchengzi&rsquo;s shibozu was in In the ancestral ancestral hall before the spirit of the ancestors before the throne, deathbed biography is located in daoxuan Shibo.</p>
<p>&quot;</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue chuckled, shook his head, and said in a low voice: &ldquo;seeing the tragic change in the gate, the two masters who killed the division are our most respected senior brothers. I, younger martial sister Su and Tian Buyi all lost their minds and were at a loss. Even when she was excited, she made a little noise. But they may have just killed the division. They are too excited to notice us here. After looking at each other for a long time, the two of them slowly knelt down before the corpse of tianchengzi and had a conversation. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From their dialogue, the three of us now know what the root cause of this catastrophe is. It turns out that there is a big secret of the ancient sword of killing immortals handed down from the ancestor of green leaf. It is that although the sword kills all the evil spirits, it may be because there are too many murders. As time goes by, the sword itself has a strange and evil nature. Once the sword holder inspires all the spiritual power of the sword, it will be devoured by the evil spirit of the sword and gradually control it The mind becomes cruel and murderous. Even if one is a man of high moral conduct, he can&rsquo;t resist it. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since the last instruction left by the founder of Qingye, the forefathers of the Qingyun gate all knew the secret, so they tried not to use the sword. However, because of the urgent situation in the war between the right and the devil, the master tianchengzi had to use this sword to launch the killing immortal sword array. After that, although he sealed the sword immediately and practiced Taoism with his heart, he could not escape the disaster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When tianchengzi was still awake, he secretly told the secret to his two most proud disciples: elder martial brother daoxuan and senior brother wanjian. First, he always believed in these two people most. Secondly, if he only told one person, he was afraid that if there was any change, master tianchengzi was afraid that his moral conduct was too high, and one of them could not control himself. In the end, it turned out to be such a result&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>Hearing this, Lu Xueqi suddenly felt a shock in her heart. She suddenly raised her head and said, &ldquo;master, now Today&rsquo;s master of daoxuan, he Is he&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue sighed and nodded silently. Lu Xueqi was speechless.</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue was silent for a long time, and he said: &ldquo;in ten years, elder martial brother daoxuan used the ancient sword of killing immortals twice. Especially in this time of beast demon disaster, he opened all the natural mechanism locks on the seven peaks of Qingyun Mountain, and pushed the power of Zhuxian sword array to the utmost. It is conceivable that the evil spirit is so powerful.</p>
<p>However, he thought that I could get through the evil spirit for ten years God, God! &quot;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi was silent for a moment and said, &ldquo;master, such a big secret, why do you want to tell the disciples that there is something important to tell the disciples?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue looked at Lu Xueqi and said, &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi slightly lowered her head and said, &ldquo;the teacher&rsquo;s kindness is very deep. If you have anything to do, please ask the master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue took a deep look at Lu Xueqi and said: &ldquo;originally, only the leader of Qingyun sect knows this secret. However, I have been paying close attention to Xiao Yicai, the eldest gate of the world, but I don&rsquo;t know clearly. As a result, among the people who still know the secret, Tian Buyi has disappeared with elder martial brother daoxuan. Younger martial sister Su and Tian are not easy. I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s a big mess now So I&rsquo;m the only one to decide what&rsquo;s going on. &quot;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi looked up at master Shuiyue, hesitated for a moment, and said, &ldquo;master, what do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue said: &ldquo;although elder martial brother daoxuan and Tian are missing, no one knows where they have gone or whether they have left Qingyun Mountain. Therefore, I have to stay on the mountain. In case they appear on the mountain, I can make a decision. But at the same time, we must also send people down the mountain to search. Our disciples, who are determined and have high Taoist qualifications, can never be compared with you. This burden is only for you. &quot;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s face was dignified, and she slowly knelt down in front of master Shuiyue. However, she was an intelligent figure in the end. How could she not understand the relationship between them.</p>
<p>After a moment, she murmured, &ldquo;master&rsquo;s order, I will obey. It&rsquo;s just But I don&rsquo;t know. If I want my disciples to go down the mountain to search for the whereabouts of the two teachers, I&rsquo;ll just tell them. Why should I tell them this secret? &quot;</p>
<p>Later, Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s voice even slightly trembled.</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue&rsquo;s face was livid, and the muscles around his eyes seemed to twitch slightly. After a long silence, she said slowly: &ldquo;Tian Bu Yi takes the initiative to see elder martial brother daoxuan. Obviously, he knows the secret and sees that he has been bitten by demons. There must be a fight between them.</p>
<p>After you go down the mountain, try to find their whereabouts. If you can find them and find out what they are fighting for at the same time&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue slowly clenched his palm and clenched it into a fist. &ldquo;You will look for an opportunity to kill the man controlled by the devil with one sword.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi looks as pale as paper, but after all, she doesn&rsquo;t say anything, just slowly lowers her head.</p>
<p>For a long time, in the stillness of the hut, she heard her voice, which was so subtle that it was almost hard to hear: &ldquo;yes.&rdquo; (to be continued. )</p>
