      <p>After a long time, Zeng Shushu and other talents recovered from their consternation. The three people looked at each other and saw the incomparable shock from each other&rsquo;s eyes. But what is different is that Lu Xueqi and Wen Min have more panic and confusion in their eyes.</p>
<p>Is this secret that only a few disciples of dazhufeng and xiaozhufeng knew and was forbidden to be spread out by Taoist immortal daoxuan several times and times?</p>
<p>Unlike Wen Min and Lu Xueqi, Zeng Shushu, who did not know about the damage of the ancient sword of killing immortals, was more surprised by the news itself. But when he came back to his senses, he laughed with a relaxed smile: &ldquo;Uncle Yun, how did you make fun of our three younger generation? I was almost scared to death by you just now. The ancient sword for killing immortals is the most precious treasure of Qingyun sect. It is kept by the leader and the master himself. How can it be damaged! Ha ha ha ha ha&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>In the laughter, Zeng Shushu kept shaking his head and smiling. He turned his head and looked at his two companions to see how they laughed at the ridiculous rumor. However, after he turned his head, the smile on his face was slightly stiff. Lu Xueqi and Wen Min did not smile at all. On the contrary, the two women frowned and looked pale.</p>
<p>On the hall, only Zeng Shushu&rsquo;s laughter echoed and quickly dropped.</p>
<p>With a smile, Yun Yilan said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a rumor! That&rsquo;s the best. Otherwise, the ancient sword of Zhuxian will be destroyed, which will really stir up the world. &quot;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi suddenly took a step forward and coldly said to Yun Yilan, &ldquo;master Yun, of course, this is untrue rumors, which can not be trusted. But I don&rsquo;t know how the senior learned about such despicable rumors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s voice became colder and colder, which seemed to have been indistinct.</p>
<p>However, Yun Yilan seems to have a good cultivation. He doesn&rsquo;t care about Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s attitude at all. He just waved his hand and said: &ldquo;in fact, this rumor has just spread in southern Xinjiang recently. I overheard what the disciples said. Most of them are not true. Think about it. With the magic power of elder martial brother daoxuan, how could such nonsense happen? But just as several nephews came, I asked by the way. I&rsquo;m really glad to learn that it&rsquo;s a rumor from the three people! Hehe&hellip; &quot; After saying that, he said with a smile and a very happy look.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi and the other three frowned slightly. How can such a thing be &ldquo;casually&rdquo; asked in public.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, the identity of Yun Yilan is very important. How can we ask such rumors in person. Thinking about it, I&rsquo;m afraid he has other ideas.</p>
<p>In the laughter of Yun Yilan, the three people of Qingyun gate are silent. Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s face is like frost. She is not like a human being. Her eyes are more and more sharp, and Wen Min&rsquo;s face is very ugly.</p>
<p>After all, Zeng Shushu was tactful, and he coughed in a hurry. Standing in front of Lu Xueqi, he arched his hand and said, &ldquo;master Yun, all of you sent us to southern Xinjiang to track the tracks of the monsters. I wonder if you have any clues to tell us, so as not to run around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cloud Yi Lan to have a look at the book, slightly nodded, but did not speak, to the back of a look.</p>
<p>Li Xun understood and stepped forward. To Zeng Shushu, he said: &ldquo;elder martial brother Zeng, I&rsquo;m Li Xun. During this period, I&rsquo;ll be a guide here in southern Xinjiang. For all of you&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hum!&rdquo; A slight angry cold hum came from the side before Li Xun finished speaking.</p>
<p>Li Xun&rsquo;s face suddenly became ugly after a pause.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Wen Min was clever and quickly said with a smile, &ldquo;elder martial brother Li, I don&rsquo;t need to trouble you. Some of us have been to southern Xinjiang, and we still know some roads. &quot;</p>
<p>Li Xun took a deep breath. The light from the corner of his eyes glanced at the figure in white beside him. The corner of his mouth moved. All of a sudden, his anger seemed to disappear. He just sighed and said with a bitter smile: &ldquo;this elder martial sister, it&rsquo;s not my intention, but we have tracked down the news of the missing beast God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Lu Xueqi, Zeng Shushu and Wen Min said this, they were moved.</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu said happily, &ldquo;is this really true?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li Xun nodded: &ldquo;not bad. In any case, the foundation and contacts of burning incense Valley in southern Xinjiang for hundreds of years are still more known than other outsiders. &quot; Having said that, he looked at Lu Xueqi again, intentionally or unintentionally. Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s face was indifferent and turned away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is the beast God?&rdquo; Zeng asked</p>
<p>Li Xun said: &ldquo;according to our information, the evil spirit has already escaped into the depths of 100000 mountains, and is heading for his nest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu and others were stunned and said, &ldquo;100000 mountains?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li Xun nodded his head and said, &ldquo;yes, I don&rsquo;t need to tell you. You must have heard about it. It&rsquo;s dangerous, weird, mysterious and unpredictable. It&rsquo;s the place where some of the most ferocious people in the world are.</p>
<p>If you didn&rsquo;t come, I was going to lead a group of younger martial brothers to go to the 100000 mountains to look for them. Now it happens that three of you are here. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be better for us to go together? I don&rsquo;t want to do anything else, but in any case, I have been in southern Xinjiang for many years. I know a little about the mysterious and extremely dangerous 100000 mountains. If I have been a guide, maybe it will be beneficial and harmless to the three of you. &quot;</p>
<p>With that, he sneered twice.</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu frowned and looked at Wen Min and Lu Xueqi behind him and said, &ldquo;wait a minute, elder martial brother Li. Let&rsquo;s discuss for a moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li Xun nodded and said, &ldquo;please help yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu and Zeng Shushu retreated to one side and talked in a low voice. Judging from Li Xun, most of the time, Zeng Shushu was talking. Sometimes Wen Min put in two sentences, but Lu Xueqi said nothing, just shaking his head or nodding his head.</p>
<p>The woman in white, as if forever is so clear and beautiful, standing there. Li Xun looks at Lu Xueqi from a distance, and seems to be crazy for a moment. At this moment, suddenly, he was slapped on the shoulder, and Li Xun was excited. Unexpectedly, someone cheated him so close that he could not find out. He turned around quickly, but it was Yun Yilan.</p>
<p>Li Xun blushed and said in a low voice, &ldquo;master, I&rsquo;ve lost my temper. What can I do for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cloud Yi Lan looked at Lu Xueqi, her face was expressionless, and she said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t forget your burden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li Xun was shocked and said in a low voice, &ldquo;I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yun Yilan nodded and said, &ldquo;take care of them. I&rsquo;ll go first.&rdquo; Having said that, he did not greet the three people of Qingyun gate and left on his own.</p>
<p>Li Xun watched Yun Yilan disappear at the gate of the back hall of the mountain and river hall. His face seemed uncertain.</p>
<p>At this time, Zeng Shushu&rsquo;s three people seemed to have negotiated and came back.</p>
<p>Zeng Shu came over with a smile and said, &ldquo;elder martial brother Li. The three of us agreed, this time Why, what about Uncle Yun? &quot;</p>
<p>Li Xun said with an apologetic look on his face: &ldquo;my master has a temporary business, and I see that the three are discussing, so I can&rsquo;t disturb you. I went first. If you are not polite, you should look forward to Haihan. &quot;</p>
<p>Zeng Shulian hurriedly said: &ldquo;where is it? We are so rude. If there is something wrong just now, please tell elder martial brother Li to reply to Uncle Yun. We are young people. We don&rsquo;t know etiquette and heaven and earth. Don&rsquo;t care about him.</p>
<p>&quot;</p>
<p>Hearing Zeng Shushu&rsquo;s words, a string of water like floating out of the mouth, Lu Xueqi and Wen Min&rsquo;s faces are somewhat embarrassed. But Zeng Shushu was calm and did not look embarrassed at all.</p>
<p>Li Xun also nodded with a smile. Instead of saying more, he said, &ldquo;what was the result of those discussions?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu bowed his hand and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to trouble elder martial brother Li this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li Xun&rsquo;s face flashed with joy and said, &ldquo;where and where, we were originally a righteous family, so we should be.&rdquo; Then he looked at Lu Xueqi and took it back. He coughed and said, &ldquo;but after all, 100000 mountains are dangerous places. You still need to be prepared in advance. Now, I&rsquo;d like to talk to a few people about some things that need attention. &quot;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu said with a smile, &ldquo;thank you, elder martial brother Li.&rdquo; Said. He turned back and waved and said, &ldquo;two elder martial sisters, come here and listen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi frowned and seemed reluctant, but she was pulled by Wen Min next to her and came over.</p>
<p>Low voice. It echoes in the mountain and river Hall</p>
<p>In the depth of 100000 mountains, leaving the last trace of darkness and crossing the last crooked old tree, GUI Li and Jin pinger finally walked out of the black forest. Outside the forest, this day was a rare sunny day in 100000 mountains. The warm ocean shone down, brushed their bodies, and landed on those twisted trees, but still could not shine into the mysterious and frightful forest.</p>
<p>Although the arms of gold have been opened again, it is still a relief for her to come out of the forest. Indeed, if you walk in a forest full of poisonous insects and rainy days, no one will be in a good mood.</p>
<p>Standing outside the forest, it&rsquo;s like breathing in the body. It&rsquo;s much more warm and comfortable. After taking a deep breath of contentment, Jin Ping&rsquo;er turned his head and looked at GUI Li. He saw that he had just walked out of the black forest. In his usual indifference, he could also see the relief.</p>
<p>After a slight pause and rest, he looked up and looked into the distance. Under the rare fine weather, the vision was wide. It seemed that there were endless mountains in the distance. The mountains were rolling one after another, and there was no end to the far sight.</p>
<p>With a slight change of color, Jin pinger came to him, looked at him, and said with a smile: &ldquo;why, I didn&rsquo;t expect that the evil land in southern Xinjiang is so vast? I was surprised when I first came here.</p>
<p>&quot;</p>
<p>Looking out into the distance, he wandered in the mountains and said, &ldquo;how far is the ancient cave of demons you mentioned?&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a charming smile, Jin pinger took two steps and looked at the endless mountains in front of GUI Li for a while. Then he reached out and pointed to one of the peaks, which were all weird and dark from the top of the mountain, and said, &ldquo;see that black peak? We went over the hill, and at the foot of the mountain, we found the ancient cave. &quot;</p>
<p>He looked up and saw the very strange peak. Far away, it seemed that there was no sunshine at all. On the contrary, it was always shrouded in a layer of light black mist, showing a bit of mystery.</p>
<p>He nodded his head and said, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having said that, he went forward, but the Golden Vase son did not move his steps, or stood in the same place.</p>
<p>After a few steps, he felt that the Golden Vase did not keep up with him. He turned around and said, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Golden Vase gave him a blank look, but even the angry look was somewhat charming in the warm and warm sunshine. &ldquo;Naturally you are a powerful person, but it&rsquo;s a pity that you are a weak woman in front of you, and now you can&rsquo;t walk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The world&rsquo;s women count and go, but you can&rsquo;t come to be a weak woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Golden Vase son smiles and is not angry. He looks for a dry stone and sits down beside him.</p>
<p>Although GUI Li didn&rsquo;t take Jin Ping er&rsquo;s words seriously. But on second thought, they did not have a good rest in this strange black forest these days. They did not insist on going on their way any more. Instead, they sat down near the Golden Vase.</p>
<p>The monkey, who had been lying on his shoulder, squeaked twice. It seems that suddenly from the fatigue wake up, a down spirit, from the fierce shoulder to the ground, look around, three eyes blink. Then the tail a warped, whiz of a dart to the side of the grass, blink of an eye disappeared.</p>
<p>The Golden Vase took a look at the direction it was going to go to and said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s dangerous everywhere. Your monkey is running around. Aren&rsquo;t you afraid of any accident?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ghost Li shook his head and said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s OK. Even if we have an accident, the guy will be fine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jin pinger chuckled and said with a smile: &ldquo;what a person.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a monkey. &quot;</p>
<p>GUI Li took a look at the jade like face of Jin Ping Er, and a faint smile appeared in the corner of his mouth. Then he looked at the direction where Xiaohui was flying away and said slowly: &ldquo;in my heart, it is much better than countless people in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Golden Vase son looked at his pale face, and the smile on his face slowly disappeared. She looked thoughtfully at GUI Li, but it seemed to frown and her face sank.</p>
<p>Maybe he suddenly found out what he said in front of others?</p>
<p>Jinpinger has always been the most intelligent woman, but she is not the quiet lady in the world. She quietly looked at the fierce face, which was as soft as water, but it was more and more ugly under her eyes.</p>
<p>This is where the embarrassment is growing. As the grimacing brow grew tighter and tighter, the Golden Vase suddenly said, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; he said</p>
<p>Jin pinger looks at him with a smile on his face, but there seems to be another meaning in his eyes. He says in a soft voice, &ldquo;do you feel a little uncomfortable?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a sharp cough. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said</p>
<p>As if he didn&rsquo;t hear his answer, Jin pinger said to herself, &ldquo;did you suddenly say something in front of a woman like me, which made you feel embarrassed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But before he could speak, Jin pinger immediately said: &ldquo;in the past ten years, especially after the accident of Biyao, you have never been alone with a woman for so long! Did you feel sorry for her when you said something unintentionally? &quot;</p>
<p>He stared at the Golden Vase, and his eyes became cold and said, &ldquo;what do you mean by these words, and why do you mention Biyao?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In his cold eyes that seemed to kill people, Jin pinger didn&rsquo;t have the slightest intention of flinching. On the contrary, she smiled, but her eyes seemed to be provocative. She had a kind of hidden excitement. Her eyes flashed and said, &ldquo;you are afraid, right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He got up and said angrily, &ldquo;what am I afraid of! If you talk nonsense again, I&rsquo;m not polite&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re afraid you&rsquo;ll forget Biyao!&rdquo; The Golden Vase suddenly raised its voice, like the sound of breaking ice and cutting snow, and inserted into the invisible land between them.</p>
<p>GUI Li opened his angry mouth and suddenly froze. He couldn&rsquo;t make any sound, such as being hit by someone.</p>
<p>The Golden Vase son also suddenly silent down, in as if is still around the quiet echo of that voice, the surrounding world suddenly quiet, there is no sound.</p>
<p>At this time, the sky was blue, the mountains in the distance rose and fell, as if from the sky, the trees and grass began to rattle.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s afternoon time. The wind swept through the face and hair.</p>
<p>The sun became more lazy, two people were silent, no one spoke.</p>
<p>The Golden Vase son looks at the man in front of her. Her eyes twinkle with something, like pity and sneer.</p>
<p>Now, she can&rsquo;t even put her hair in the wind for a while because of her gentle voice</p>
<p>Her smile seemed to be faint, like a wild flower shaking in the wind. &ldquo;She tried her best to suppress herself and remind herself from time to time that who in the world knew that Gui Li, the first general of the ghost King clan, who was afraid of everyone, was such a poor man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The expression on GUI Li&rsquo;s face changed, blue and white. Suddenly he took a long breath and looked up at the sky. Hold your breath for a moment and then slowly spit out. When he looked back again, his face was calm, and there was no trace of sadness or joy, but indifference.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you. How can I say that to myself? &quot; He is light, in the eye faintly has the sarcasm meaning, seems to have just that moment&rsquo;s gaffe to forget for a moment.</p>
<p>The Golden Vase said with a smile: &ldquo;me? I&rsquo;m no one. I&rsquo;m just a woman with you now. &quot;</p>
<p>GUI Li ignored the stab in her words. Turn to open a head, at this time the grass beside suddenly a minute, gray shadow flashed, but small ash jumped out, two or three jump back to the ghost. On a closer look, I saw the monkey slowly holding a number of wild fruits, even in the mouth is still chewing, no wonder just can not hear the familiar &ldquo;squeak&rdquo; call.</p>
<p>GUI Li picked it up, spread out his hands, and Xiao Hui cracked his mouth with a smile. Put the wild fruit in the palm of the devil&rsquo;s hand. I saw the wild fruit red, very lovely, although not very big, but look at the fruit full, very attractive.</p>
<p>GUI Li took one and put it in his mouth and took two bites. He felt that although the taste was green and astringent, it was a rare delicacy.</p>
<p>Nodding, he divided several.</p>
<p>After looking at the Golden Vase, he handed it over and said, &ldquo;Xiaohui is born with the ability to recognize poison. All the wild fruits he picks are edible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Golden Vase did not immediately follow. He turned his eyes on the hand in front of him. He suddenly showed his face and said with a smile: &ldquo;you have nothing to worry about when you share it with me like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost frowned and snorted. His hands turned up and clenched into fists. He wanted to shrink back.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just now. Jin pinger&rsquo;s arm suddenly stretched out, but she grabbed his hand and said with a smile, &ldquo;I want it, I want it&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li&rsquo;s face changed slightly. He looked at the Golden Vase and slowly unfolded his fingers to reveal the wild fruits.</p>
<p>Soft palm skin, far away, there is a faint trace of if there is no breath, floating in the wind. At the moment, the golden vase&rsquo;er&rsquo;s eyes seemed to be suddenly soft as water waves, flowing gently and gently, stretching out the verdant and slender fingers, picking up the wild fruits one by one from the heart of the ghostly hands.</p>
<p>Thin fingernails, in the palm of the rough skin seems to inadvertently skim, warm, with a strange cold.</p>
<p>She gazed at the man in front of her, gently and slowly let go of her hand. Then she laughed, took a wild fruit and put it in her mouth. After eating a few times, she said with a smile, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s delicious!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her smile is the most beautiful flower in the afternoon, moving.</p>
<p>He looked at her without saying a word.</p>
<p>Jin pinger&rsquo;s smile became more and more charming and said with a smile: &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter? I don&rsquo;t say a word. I&rsquo;m like a fool&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li looked at the Golden Vase and laughed, but he did not show any sign. After a moment, he suddenly said, &ldquo;the purple mang blade&rdquo; and even the magic weapon of Yin, evil and evil. You can cultivate it to &ldquo;absorb Yin and return to the abyss&rdquo; and integrate it with your own Qi and pulse. It&rsquo;s really great. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Puff&rdquo;, the wild fruits in the Golden Vase burst in an instant, and even the juice in them was not splashed out. They were frozen into ice blocks by the strange cold air and fell to the ground.</p>
<p>Jin Ping&rsquo;er was still smiling on her gentle face a moment ago. She lost her smile in an instant. Her eyes were like a knife and she was staring at the ghost.</p>
<p>However, as if he had not felt it at all, he said in a light way: &ldquo;although you are a pure Yin body, and are connected with the spirit of zimang blade, but the cold Yin Qi is too strong and the solitary Yin is not long, you are forced to practice, Yin Qi enters the body, and all the Qi and blood in the meridians are injured. Naturally, you are very powerful with this magic weapon, but if you want to go one step further in the practice of Taoism in the future, it will be even more difficult.</p>
<p>&quot;</p>
<p>After that, he ignored the ugly face of jinpinger at the moment, turned around and walked away. At the same time, Xiaohui, a monkey eating wild fruits, jumped over to his shoulder and continued to walk towards the scorched Black Mountain in the distance.</p>
<p>Only left the gold bottle son standing in place, looking at the far away figure, and slowly raised his right hand, silently looked. In the sun, the white, thin and beautiful palm is shining like transparent jade. However, from the deepest point, though not obvious, we can still see the unnatural light blue color, which is distributed in the depth of muscle texture like subtle blood vessels.</p>
<p>The Golden Vase son&rsquo;s face was as heavy as water. Suddenly he snorted coldly, and without saying anything, he went straight to the direction of the ghost. Lifting her feet, she will be heavily frozen into ice a few wild fruit, step on the smash. (to be continued. )</p>
