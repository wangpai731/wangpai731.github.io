      <p>&ldquo;Purple gas into tripod!&rdquo; Hou Yunfei and Du Lingfei, at the same time, exclaimed. Both of them showed a stronger shock.</p>
<p>Du Lingfei, in particular, has already mastered the difficulty of lifting a heavy vessel like a light, and clearly knows the difficulty of turning the purple gas into a tripod, which is a magic power that few people can master on the south bank, even in the purple tripod mountain.</p>
<p>In the roar, the huge tripod was directly hit by the fierce ghost, and the ground was shaken for a moment. The ghost&rsquo;s body broke down in an instant and turned into countless black gas, spreading to all directions, revealing the dying Chen Yue in it.</p>
<p>Chen Yue&rsquo;s blood spurted out and his body fell to the ground. He looked at the dissipated tripod bitterly and murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ziqi Huading&hellip; &quot; After that, he struggled to look at Bai Xiaochun. His body did not move, and he died. He used to use the secret method. He had already suffered five pains and seven injuries. At the moment, he was broken by the purple Qi tripod, and even the fierce ghosts were broken. How could he continue to live.</p>
<p>Until he died, he opened his eyes and looked at Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>Seeing Chen Yue&rsquo;s death, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s body relaxed at once. He consumed too much aura in his body, so that his head was dizzy. He stood there shivering and his body was shaking. His face was pale. Some people couldn&rsquo;t believe that he had killed everyone.</p>
<p>Looking back on the scene just now, Bai Xiaochun only felt a sweet taste in his mouth and the blood overflowed again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m bleeding I I was almost killed Bai Xiaochun felt pain all over her body, especially when her shoulder was lifted up. Her skin was scorched in many places. The pain made her think of the previous battle and shivered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I Why did I come back Just a moment ago, I was not careful, maybe I lost my life Bai Xiaochun has been safe for a small part of my life. How could I be impulsive this time&hellip; &quot; When Bai Xiaochun was afraid of some regrets, he suddenly came across a delicate body with amazing elasticity, concave and convex, even with the delicate fragrance of a virgin, and rushed directly to his arms. It was Du Lingfei.</p>
<p>White small pure one Leng, immediately facial expression is solemn, embrace Du Lingfei, light open mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elder martial sister Du is not afraid. With me, Bai Xiaochun, no one can hurt you at all!&rdquo; With that, his hand unconsciously touched the raised place</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, thank you&hellip;&rdquo; Du Lingfei is excited and tears are flowing. When she reacts, she finds that she is in Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s arms. She also notices that there is a hand touching her behind her. Her face turns red. She quickly steps back and looks at Bai Xiaochun angrily.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun coughed, and his heart was quite memorable. He said that Du Lingfei was indeed one of the five beauties on the south bank. His figure alone was enough to stand out in the world.</p>
<p>At the moment, Hou Yunfei looks strange. He coughs and looks at Bai Xiaochun with a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Younger martial brother Bai, there will be plenty of time to ponder. The next group of pursuers will be sent out by the falling dust family. This time, it is estimated that they will be the strongest except the founder of Zhuji. We should seize the time to escape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Bai Xiaochun heard this, his heart trembled. Just now these people, he fought everything to win. At the thought that the other party would send out more strong men like Chen Yue, Bai Xiaochun shivered and looked pale. After looking around, she shrunk his neck and nodded quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, yes, let&rsquo;s go. Let&rsquo;s run!&rdquo; As he said this, he immediately ran forward. This scene of fear of death formed a strong contrast with the iron blood just now. However, Du Lingfei did not feel disgusted, but felt lovely. So he also followed the past. When he looked at Bai Xiaochun, he remembered the other side&rsquo;s rescue and the scene of the iron war just now. His eyes were more colorful.</p>
<p>Hou Yunfei shakes his head and takes away all the storage bags on the people of Luochen family. He catches up with Bai Xiaochun and hands it to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Younger martial brother Bai, these are your booty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun didn&rsquo;t look at it carefully and threw it into his arms. At the moment, he couldn&rsquo;t help shivering. The only thought in his mind was to run for his life.</p>
<p>In the underground palace of the Luochen family in the Luoxing mountain range, when Bai Xiaochun killed the first member of the Luochen family, a node on the array node around the blood Lake exploded and broke directly, and the blood inside was dried up.</p>
<p>In this scene, the people of the Luochen family around were stunned. When they looked at it suddenly, they didn&rsquo;t wait for them to react. Then the second node, the third, the fourth, the fifth</p>
<p>In the constant roar, one after another to break apart.</p>
<p>This scene immediately surprised all the people of the Luochen family. As their faces changed greatly, the ancestors of the Luochen family in the blood Lake slowly opened their eyes.</p>
<p>Just as he opened his eyes, another roar came from the node where Chen Yue was before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chen Yue They were all killed</p>
<p>&ldquo;All of them are dead. Seven of them are dead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can this be possible? The seven of them just went after two other disciples. Did Lingxi sect know about us and sent a foundation building monk?&rdquo; All the members of the Luochen family could no longer hold back. They were all in uproar, and even many of them showed fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Noisy!&rdquo; Just as they exclaimed, an old and cold voice came from the mouth of the old man in the blood lake. It was like a thunder blast, which directly reverberated in the hearts and minds of all the people here. It made people tremble and shut up one by one, and looked at their ancestors uneasily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To change one&rsquo;s life against the heaven and remove the imprint in the blood is a chance that our family has only had in a thousand years. Since it has been decided, don&rsquo;t think about it. If a foundation building monk steps into my array, I will be aware of it at the first time. Now There has been no foundation building monk coming, and no news has come out. What are you panicking about? &quot; The old man opened his mouth slowly, and his face was very ugly. If he had not presided over this important array at the moment, he would have gone out and killed Bai Xiaochun and others by himself.</p>
<p>Once he goes out and gets rid of the family anti blood array controlled by Lingxi clan, he will fall short of success, even if he is swallowed back. He may still be able to barely survive, but all the clansmen will instantly reverse their blood and die.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you can kill Chen Yue and others, you don&rsquo;t need to build a foundation. For these two disciples, there are some hidden accomplishments, or they have great treasures!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even if it&rsquo;s hidden cultivation, it&rsquo;s only eight layers of condensate at most. As for heavy treasure The greater the power, the more restricted the condensate friar will be. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heng&rsquo;er!&rdquo; The old man&rsquo;s eyes flashed, and his right hand raised a pat on the nearby blood lake. Immediately, the lake water rolled violently, and a young man in a blood robe rose slowly from the lake.</p>
<p>The young man was very beautiful and angular. At the moment, his eyes suddenly opened, revealing a touch of blood light. In this moment, the momentum of the whole person suddenly rose. There were nine bloody and fierce ghosts around him, sending out a silent ferocious roar.</p>
<p>All the members of the Luochen family were excited when they saw the young man one by one. They all bowed their heads to see him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heng&rsquo;er, as the young master of my Luochen family, you are the strongest one in the family except for my husband. You have cultivated nine layers of condensation gas Enough to do the task, you take nine people with you, make sure Kill all the three outer disciples of Lingxi sect When the old man looked at the youth, his eyes showed rare kindness and appreciation, and his tone was softer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they don&rsquo;t die, I won&rsquo;t come back.&rdquo; The young man&rsquo;s eyes were cold, he nodded at the smell of the speech, and his body leaped up. The nine blood colored virtual shadows around him formed a blood mist at his feet, which made him fly into the clouds and fly into the bleeding lake, floating in the air. After ordering nine family members, ten people suddenly left.</p>
<p>Soon, ten figures roared out of the house of the Luo Chen family. During the wave of the young man named Chen Heng, blood mist appeared under everyone&rsquo;s feet, and they all flew with them.</p>
<p>The speed is so fast that Yun Fei can&rsquo;t be compared in the earth. In the blink of an eye, he follows the death place of Chen Yue and others, and flies away according to the family blood.</p>
<p>Except Chen Heng, who is the ninth layer of condensate, the weakest of the others is the seventh layer of condensate. Five of them, like Chen Yue, are all condensate layer 8.</p>
<p>This kind of lineup is the strongest force that the Luochen family can play at the moment.</p>
<p>That is to say, in the time of a stick of incense, ten people of Chen Heng rushed out of the jungle of the Luoxing mountains in a roar. When they appeared, they were already in the place where seven people of Chen Yue died.</p>
<p>Looking at the startling corpse, except Chen Heng, the other people all look different.</p>
<p>Chen Heng looked cold, looking at a corpse on the ground, especially at the people whose necks were pinched off, his eyes showed a faint light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cultivation of physical training!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a flash, he appeared next to Chen Yue&rsquo;s body. He looked down for a few seconds. Thinking, his right hand suddenly raised and pressed toward the ground. His eyes closed. Soon, his eyes suddenly opened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Interesting, it&rsquo;s the residual wave of Ziqi Huading Ding&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a fellow practitioner of Dharma. He has strong physical strength and amazing martial arts. No wonder he can kill Chen Yue and others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This person should be one of the heavenly pride of Lingxi sect, Shangguan Tianyou? Or Lu Tianlei? &quot; In Chen Heng&rsquo;s eyes, there was a fierce light. In the depth of the light, there was a strong sense of war.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wait for each to choose a direction to look for, but observe, immediately send out the signal!&rdquo; Chen Heng got up and his voice was cold. Nine people around him bowed their heads and said yes. They scattered and searched with all their strength.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The range of the array is very large. You can&rsquo;t go out for half a month, and you I can&rsquo;t escape! &quot; Chen Heng Leng hum, also chose a direction, suddenly flew out.</p>
