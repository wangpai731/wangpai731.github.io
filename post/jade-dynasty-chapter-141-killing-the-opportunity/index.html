      <p>On the Yuqing hall, daoxuan real man, with a dark green robe and a long beard, sits on the throne of the hall. On both sides of the seats are the first seats of other veins of Qingyun. It can be said that during the battle of Qingyun Mountain ten years ago, three of the seven veins of Qingyun gate changed their first seats. Compared with the time when Zhang Xiaofan and Lin Jingyu just arrived at Qingyun, things are different.</p>
<p>In addition to the position of Cangsong Taoist in Longshou peak, which was replaced by Qi Hao, the position of the first Shang Zhengliang of Chaoyang peak was replaced by his disciple Chu Yuhong, and that of the first Tianyun Taoist priest of Luoxia peak was replaced by his junior brother, Taoist Fei Yun. Among these three veins, in addition to Luoxia peak, Feiyun Taoist priest and daoxuan Zhenren are the same generation. Besides, they can also refer to the mouth to say a few words. The first one of Longshou peak and Chaoyang peak is more embarrassing. Qi Hao of longshoufeng is OK. After all, he is the best of the younger generation, and he is familiar with other teachers. As for Chu Yuhong of Chaoyang peak, he sits at the end in silence, without speaking from beginning to end.</p>
<p>The first seats of the older generation, dazhufengtian, xiaozhufeng Shuiyue master and fenghuifeng Zeng Shuchang, have not been seen for a long time. However, most of the leaders who quarreled with them are no longer there. The scene on the hall is more harmonious than before.</p>
<p>After master Shuiyue, Lu Xueqi and Wen Min were standing behind him. After a period of time, Lu Xueqi was as beautiful as ever. Her face was light, but she didn&rsquo;t show her anger. But somehow, she felt a slight chill that she had never seen before.</p>
<p>At the moment, master song Wenmin is quite angry, but he can&rsquo;t help but look at Song shuimin&rsquo;s back. He can&rsquo;t help but look at him.</p>
<p>Tian Buyi&rsquo;s wife, Su Ru, also follows him. At the moment, Tian linger, who comes with Qi Hao, is summoned to his side. Mother and daughter spoke in a low voice. They did not see each other for a long time.</p>
<p>Besides Tian ling&rsquo;er, Qi Hao came with him. It was his younger brother Lin Jingyu. At this time, he stood behind him, together with Zeng Shushu, the son of Zeng Shuchang, the first member of fenghuifeng mountain. They had experienced the war of death together, which was regarded as friendship.</p>
<p>This green cloud gathering.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a formal occasion. Most people are relaxed. Even the conversation between daoxuan and Tian Buyi, Zeng Shuchang, Shuiyue master and others is quite relaxed. Except for Shuiyue, which has always been indifferent, most of the others have a smile on their faces.</p>
<p>When Li Xun of burning incense Valley walked into the Yuqing palace, he saw such a picture in front of him. Only a moment later, his eyes were on the frost woman. Flickering like a flame.</p>
<p>Xiao Yi went up to daoxuan and said, &ldquo;master, Li Xun, senior brother Li is here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan looked over with a smile. Li Xun went to Xiao Yicai and saluted him. He said, &ldquo;Li Xun, the descendant of the burning incense Valley, please meet him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taoist immortal smile way: &ldquo;just, get up quickly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li Xun rose up in accordance with the words, then bowed his hands around him and said, &ldquo;younger Li Xun. I&rsquo;ve met all of you</p>
<p>Tian Buyi, Zeng Shuchang and others made a sign in succession.</p>
<p>Daoxuan was really humane: &ldquo;is your master OK? I haven&rsquo;t seen you for many years. I don&rsquo;t know how Brother Yun is. A few days ago, I heard that the master of cloud Valley suddenly closed down. I was really worried for a while</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai was standing next to Taoist immortal daoxuan at the moment. Hearing this, he said with a smile: &ldquo;master, I don&rsquo;t know. I just listened to elder martial brother Li&rsquo;s words. Master Yun has already passed the pass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Daoxuan was slightly surprised, &ldquo;ah&rdquo;. He said to Li Xun, &ldquo;is that right, good nephew?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li xungong said respectfully: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s true. The master did leave the pass a few days ago, and specially sent his disciples to pay a visit to leader daoxuan. There was also a letter asking me to transfer it to the real person seat.&rdquo; Then he took out a sealed envelope from his arms and handed it to Taoist immortal.</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan took the letter, pondered for a moment, tore off the seal, took out the thin writing paper, and looked at it carefully from the beginning to the end. Everyone else looked at his face, but his face was the same as usual, and no one could see the ups and downs of his mood.</p>
<p>After a while, the real man daoxuan finished reading the letter, slowly put away the letter paper, put it back into the envelope, stroked it for a moment, and put it on the tea table beside him. Li Xun carefully looked at daoxuan immortal, but did not listen to the words of the man who claimed to be the first person in the right way. He felt a little uneasy in his heart.</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan pondered for a long time, and glanced at master Shuiyue. Master Shuiyue seemed to be aware of it and frowned.</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan took back his eyes, coughed, and looked at Li Xun, who was still standing in the room. He had a kind smile on his face and said with a smile, &ldquo;dear nephew, did the cloud Valley master tell you something before you came to Qingyun?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li Xun hesitated for a moment and said with his fist clasping: &ldquo;my master once told me that immortal XuanZhen of Qingyun sect is the current grand master of the right way. When his disciples come to Qingyun to see the real man, he is about to have a good experience. Before returning to the burning incense Valley, he can listen to the real man&rsquo;s instructions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Taoist priest was stunned and then said with a smile, &ldquo;you master, you are really slippery. If you have any problems, you have lost them to me.&rdquo; After that, he paused for a moment, and then nodded his head and said, &ldquo;well, your master also said in his letter that he would lead the disciples of the burning incense Valley to Zhongtu in three days at most. Most of them would come to Qingyun Mountain first. Before that, you should stay for a few days in my Qingyun Mountain. &quot;</p>
<p>Li Xun&rsquo;s heart a joy, even busy way: &ldquo;yes, I obey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taoist immortal nodded slightly, and then seemed to think of something. Turning to Lu Xueqi standing behind the master Shuiyue, he said, &ldquo;Xueqi.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi did not expect that daoxuan would suddenly call her, but was surprised. Then she stood up and saluted: &ldquo;master, master, disciple is here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan said with a smile: &ldquo;you and elder martial brother Li Xun of the burning incense valley are old acquaintances. I remember that you have met many times in the past few years. In this way, please take him around Qingyun Mountain these days, and you can&rsquo;t lose the way of hospitality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi frowned and turned to master Shuiyue. However, master Shuiyue frowned and looked at real daoxuan. Immortal daoxuan looked back at her and asked for advice.</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue sighed in his heart and said to Lu Xueqi, &ldquo;since the master&rsquo;s orders come down, Qi&rsquo;er, you are familiar with him, so you can take him for a walk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi moved the corner of her mouth and slowly lowered her head. After a moment. In a low voice, &ldquo;yes, I obey my teacher&rsquo;s instructions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li Xun was overjoyed, but he still kept a smile on his face, and said with a smile to Lu Xueqi: &ldquo;so there is a sister laborer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi nodded slightly. But there was no other look.</p>
<p>On the seat, Taoist immortal daoxuan nodded with a smile. Next to him, Zeng Shuchang and Tian Buyi looked here without saying anything. Instead, Su Ru, Tian Bu Yi&rsquo;s wife, took a look here from the conversation with her daughter Tian linger, and her eyebrows wrinkled slightly.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>The party broke up for a long time.</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi takes his wife Su Ru and his eldest disciple song Daren out of the Yuqing Hall of Tongtian peak. Song Daren comes out with his master, but he can&rsquo;t help looking back.</p>
<p>This action fell together and walked out of the eyes of Tian ling&rsquo;er, who sent her father and mother. Suddenly, she burst out laughing.</p>
<p>Hearing the laughter, Tian Bu Yi and Su Ru all turned around. Su Ru looked at her daughter and said with a smile, &ldquo;what are you laughing at?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian ling&rsquo;er goes to her mother, takes Su Ru&rsquo;s hand and looks at the elder martial brother. Song Daren has a ghost in his heart, and his face turns red.</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi snorted. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; he said</p>
<p>Tian ling&rsquo;er said with a smile: &ldquo;father, mother, you&rsquo;d better help elder martial brother go to xiaozhufeng and ask martial uncle Shuiyue to propose marriage, or he will die in a hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian is not easy to be stunned. Su Ru, however, is far more clever than her husband. She responds to song Daren with a smile: &ldquo;what, you already have a lover. Or a disciple of xiaozhufeng, my elder sister Shuiyue? Come on, talk to your teacher. I&rsquo;ll make the decision for you. &quot;</p>
<p>Song Daren opened his mouth to speak, but it was not easy to look at the field. But she could not say anything, so she had to lower her head. Su Ru was stunned and said, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s wrong with you, Da Ren?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian ling&rsquo;er laughed and said, &ldquo;the elder martial brother is not afraid of being scolded by his father. I&rsquo;ll make it for him&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>Song Daren was a little nervous and opened his mouth and said, &ldquo;younger martial sister, you&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian ling&rsquo;er ignored him and said to Su Ru: &ldquo;what the elder martial brother likes is elder martial sister Wenmin under the seat of martial uncle Shuiyue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi snorted again, and her face was full of Yang and Yin, but Su Ru laughed and said, &ldquo;good boy, I have a bit of vision. Wenmin is really a good girl, but I can&rsquo;t tell what I&rsquo;m thinking. I&rsquo;m not good at that&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren was in a hurry and looked up and said, &ldquo;she, she is the same&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words did not fall, but saw the master, the teacher&rsquo;s mother and the little younger martial sister all looking at themselves together. Their faces looked like a smile, but they couldn&rsquo;t speak any more, so they had to lower their heads again.</p>
<p>Su Ru shook her head and said with a bitter smile, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s all right. You&rsquo;ve learned from your master&rsquo;s vision, but how can you not learn from his thick skin&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi coughed and glared at him, but Su Ru ignored him and said to song Daren, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t worry. It&rsquo;s my Shiniang. As long as other girls are willing to do it, you can always fulfill your wish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren&rsquo;s heart was in full bloom, and his face was extremely brilliant. Tian was not easy to snort and said, &ldquo;look at your achievements!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren was startled. He quickly put aside his smile and stood behind his master. However, the smile on his face could not be concealed. Su Ru smiles and shakes her head. She pulls her daughter aside and tells her for a long time. Then she comes back. She flies with Tian Buyi and song Daren and goes back to dazhufeng.</p>
<p>After about half an hour, they returned to dazhufeng.</p>
<p>Tian is not easy to land and doesn&rsquo;t speak. She goes straight to Shoujing hall. Su Ru turns her head and says to song Daren, &ldquo;you go to have a rest. You can rest assured about that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren couldn&rsquo;t help but giggle twice and saluted quickly. Then he strode back.</p>
<p>Su Ru smiles and shakes her head, and slowly walks back to Shoujing hall. Seeing that Tian is not easy to sit on the hall, she goes over and says with a smile: &ldquo;Hey, you are the marriage of your proud eldest disciple. You want to ask my elder sister Shuiyue to propose marriage by yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi snorted, turned his head, and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to plead with your elder martial sister in a low voice. I won&rsquo;t go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru didn&rsquo;t get angry, but said with a smile, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care if you want to be a bachelor all my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi showed a trace of disdain on his face. He looked up at the sky and said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care about it. I&rsquo;m not a bachelor all my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru couldn&rsquo;t help laughing and puffing. She reached out and patted the field. She said, &ldquo;really, I don&rsquo;t want to see how old I am, and I still look so old and mean!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi blinked his eyes, but he still looked up at the sky. His heart was like a stone, he didn&rsquo;t cry when he saw the coffin, and he didn&rsquo;t look back when he kicked to Nanshan.</p>
<p>Su Ru can&rsquo;t help it. He only said, &ldquo;well, seriously, it&rsquo;s not easy for you to have a lover. Besides, Wenmin is really good. I like it, too. You just go to xiaozhufeng to talk to my elder sister Shuiyue. If I&rsquo;m there to help you, you&rsquo;ll be told a few innocuous gossips by her. What&rsquo;s the matter? Since Wen Min has a little affection for us, my elder martial sister will not be unhappy with you. It&rsquo;s a mistake for a lifetime. &quot;</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi, with a long face, said angrily, &ldquo;I knew that the eldest brother is not promising. Really, I fell in love with the person of xiaozhufeng. I am so old that I still have to suffer from the birdlike spirit of Shuiyue woman!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru &ldquo;bah&rdquo; a, way: &ldquo;I am also xiaozhufeng people, how did you also like me, look at your point of success, now unexpectedly with me to turn over the old account.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not easy to be speechless. &ldquo;Just, just, anyway, I&rsquo;ve already recognized my life, a group of worthless guys, I&rsquo;ll go to xiaozhufeng.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru nodded and smile and said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s almost the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He put the matter aside, walked aside, just took a few steps, and suddenly stopped and turned around. His eyebrows wrinkled slightly, and he seemed to think of something. It was not easy to say to Tian: &ldquo;by the way, you saw Li Xun, the burning incense Valley, today. Is there something wrong with the back? &quot;</p>
<p>Is it not easy for you to receive Mr. Lu</p>
<p>Su Ru nodded her head and said, &ldquo;do you see something wrong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Buyi snorted and said: &ldquo;nothing wrong. If there is a problem, your elder martial sister would have refused coldly, but you can see that she has no voice at all. It can be seen that at least the leader and elder martial brother have told her about this. Your elder martial sister also agreed</p>
<p>Su Ru was stunned and then nodded: &ldquo;well, you&rsquo;re right. I didn&rsquo;t think of this. But elder martial sister always loves Lu Xueqi the most. How could she&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi said coldly: &ldquo;that Li Xun is very bad. In her eyes, I&rsquo;m afraid that he is much better than our disciples.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru is surprised: &ldquo;good, how did you pull to this up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi said casually, &ldquo;on Liubo mountain in the East China Sea, on that stormy night, I punished Lao Qi. She was not&hellip;&rdquo; When he said this, he suddenly woke up and stopped talking, but somehow he shook his head and sighed.</p>
<p>Su Ru frowned and said, &ldquo;the more you say, the more strange it is. Even Xiao Fan has been pulled in. What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The field is not easy to seem to be in a state of apathy suddenly, mention not spirit come, shake head a way: &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t ask.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru knew her husband&rsquo;s temper, so she stopped talking. However, she suddenly touched her mind and sighed, &ldquo;ten years ago, I don&rsquo;t know how Xiao Fan is now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian was not easy to be silent for a long time. He stood up slowly and said coldly, &ldquo;haven&rsquo;t you heard that he is now the vice leader of the ghost King clan. His name is GUI Li, and he is called&rdquo; blood childe &ldquo;. He is very fierce</p>
<p>Su Ru lowered her head and slowly sat down on the chair beside her. For a long time, she said in a low voice: &ldquo;well, when he first came to our door, although he was a bit stupid, but&hellip;&rdquo; She didn&rsquo;t go on. She was silent for a long time and said softly, &ldquo;what a good child I was. She was very respectful to you and me, but now But it ended up being driven out of the door and wall</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi flashed his anger and suddenly said in a loud voice: &ldquo;if they want to be expelled, they will be expelled. I didn&rsquo;t say that they want to expel this apprentice&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru stood up, interrupted her husband, and said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not easy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Buyi looked at his wife, stopped talking and stopped talking. However, his face was more indignant. He stamped his foot suddenly and made a heavy &ldquo;Ai&rdquo; sound. He strode into the back of Shoujing hall.</p>
<p>Su Ru looked at her husband&rsquo;s back, sighed quietly, turned around and looked out.</p>
<p>From the gate of Shoujing hall, we can see that the warm sunshine is shining on the big bamboo peak. In the distance, there is a secluded kitchen with a corner of eaves exposed behind the tree shadow.</p>
<p>The house is still there, but the people are gone.</p>
<p>Su Ru watched silently for a while, shook her head, turned and walked into the back hall of Shoujing hall.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Night is approaching, the sky layer by layer of dark clouds, pressure is very low, looking at some people breathless.</p>
<p>In this case, there is no star and no moon. At the foot of the barren mountain, there is only a hillside with leeward wind, and there is a bonfire.</p>
<p>Monday immortal and his party of three people, with newly added ghost and monkey ash, walked along the ancient road. This day, they arrived at the foot of kongsang mountain. It was late, so they built a fire in the leeward place and prepared to sleep in the wild.</p>
<p>Although he has been away for many years, he has been used to these things. Once he sat down, he still cried out his pain. He did not stop beating his back with his hands, which seemed to break his waist. But other people all ignore him, call for a while, unavoidably boring, also slowly stopped.</p>
<p>Xiao Huan squatted beside the fire, put his hands on the fire to warm up, while the wild dog Taoist put down the ghost and many packages on his back and walked to the fire. This is the real gasp. In one line, it is monkey Xiaohui who is the most energetic. As soon as he falls on the ground, he looks around and jumps over.</p>
<p>After Xiaohuan decided to take GUI li away, he was so intoxicated for a long time. He woke up once in a while, looked at the people around him, and turned a blind eye to him. He called Xiao Hui, opened the wine bag on his back and drank wine. After a while, he was drunk again. He was really drunk.</p>
<p>Along the way, the wild dog Taoist priest had another task to carry on his back besides the package, and most of the monkey&rsquo;s little ash would jump on the ghost and make him even heavier. If he hadn&rsquo;t practiced Taoism for some time, ordinary people would not have been able to support him.</p>
<p>The wild dog Taoist priest gasped for a long time, looked around, and saw that Monday immortal mumbled for a long time. He was probably tired and lay on the side and slept with his clothes. Xiaohuan was lying not far from the fire.</p>
<p>As for the sleepy ghost, because just now the wild dog Taoist put him in a far away place intentionally or unintentionally. At this time, the fire light could not reach the place far away, only a vague shadow could be reflected. However, the three eyed monkey beside him did not know where he had gone. Most of the time he ran away to find some wild fruit to eat. Xiaohui often did so all the way.</p>
<p>The wild dog sat quietly in front of the fire, and the surroundings gradually quieted down. The loud voice of Monday fairy&rsquo;s sleeping slowly rang out, and Xiao Huan&rsquo;s body rose and fell slightly. It seemed that she was already asleep.</p>
<p>The fire reflected on the wild dog&rsquo;s face, which reflected the uncertainty of his expression and the strange light in his eyes.</p>
<p>After a while, he suddenly looked up and looked at the high and steep kongsang mountain in the dark, which was the holy land of his blood refining hall. But at this time, the blood refining hall had already disappeared, leaving only one ghost of his own.</p>
<p>He slowly turned back, and the man who was drowsy and drunk in the shadow of the night lay motionless in the distance.</p>
<p>The wild dog Taoist took a deep breath, and his men consciously reached to his waist and grasped his magic weapon of beast teeth.</p>
<p>Then, he slowly got up and walked toward the ghost. The fire light on his back, and his shadow became longer and longer. Gradually, he lay on the ground and covered it with ghost.</p>
<p>The next moment, he stood in front of the ghost. (to be continued.</p>
<p>)</p>
