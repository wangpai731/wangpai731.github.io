<p>&ldquo;Squeak&rdquo;!</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>The bark of the dog is intertwined with the scream of the monkey, echoing on the Dazhu Peak of Qingyun Mountain, breaking the tranquility here. Holding the black burning stick in his hand, Zhang Xiaofan rushed out of the kitchen door and was furious: &ldquo;Dead dog! Dead monkey! Don&rsquo;t run!</p>
<p>The monkey jumped on the back of the big yellow dog with a swish, and the already-running rhubarb spread out on all four feet and ran, Zhang Xiaofan couldn&rsquo;t catch up, watching Xiao gray making a face, and put a fragrant meat bone on the rhubarb. Mouth. Rhubarb was so excited that Dog Yan Dayue, if it were not for two rows of teeth to bite the meat bones, I was afraid that the dog teeth would have fallen off after a long laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;call!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan looked depressed and walked back to the kitchen indignantly. Since he was in charge of the kitchen when he was 14 years old, his craftsmanship has made everyone look at it, and rhubarb, with his “obtaining old dogs”, couldn’t help but covet the deliciousness of Zhang Xiaofan’s hands, especially the meat and bones that Zhang Xiaofan used to cook soup, fragrant It is delicious, and it is the big meal that Rhubarb dreams of.</p>
<p>However, Zhang Xiaofan boiled the soup for people. Although the &ldquo;age&rdquo; of rhubarb is big (Tian is not easy to grow up from childhood) and is older, he does not get the treatment he deserves. He often covets it but does not get it. Until it was familiar with the monkey Xiaohui, the scene above often appeared on Dazhufeng, which lasted for two years, allowing Zhang Xiaofan to hide the secret of the bones, as long as there was a big yellow nose and the flexibility of Xiaohui, This battle of flesh and bones often ends in Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s defeat.</p>
<p>Two years have passed by in a hurry. In fact, in a year and a half, Zhang Xiaofan has grown into a sixteen-year-old boy and is taller. Now he is half as tall as his sister Tian Ling&rsquo;er. During this time, because of Tian’s difficult ordinance, all the disciples on Dazhu Peak closed their doors to practice hardly. Except for the old Sixth Du Bishu who traveled down the mountain, only Zhang Xiaofan was the most idle.</p>
<p>In the past two years, Zhang Xiaofan has been practicing alone without anyone paying attention, but what he did not believe is that according to the method taught to him by his brother Song Daren, he only spent one year, it seems that The training completed the second layer of Yu Qingjing-Qi Lian.</p>
<p>He had doubts in his heart, but he didn’t ask Tian after all, and Song Daren, Tian Ling&rsquo;er and others had been concentrating on closed-door practice and had no time to take care of his affairs. He went down the mountain with Du Bishu, who was his best, so he only asked this question. Hidden in the heart. But then there was a big difficult thing before him. Tian Ling&rsquo;er privately gave him the third-level trick. He knew it was a big foul, but every night, he was alone. One person, when standing in the courtyard looking up at the night sky, will remember a sentence:</p>
<p>You can practice more than Brother Qi Hao!</p>
<p>After ten nights, he began to practice the third-level law!</p>
<p>In Taiji Xuanqing Dao, the first to third layers of Yuqingjing are the foundation of all the spells, and the difficulty is getting deeper. Unlike the first two layers of &ldquo;Qi Qi&rdquo; and &ldquo;Qi Refining&rdquo;, the third layer of the law is &ldquo;Vitality&rdquo; &ldquo;I have focused on practicing Tai Chi. Fa Jueyun: &ldquo;Tai Chi vitality, letter three is one. The pole, the middle is also; Yuan, the beginning is also, traveling in the twelve chen&hellip; This Yin and Yang He De, Qi Zhong Yu Zi, metamorphosis everything.&rdquo; (Note: Spoken &ldquo;Hanshu Lulizhi&rdquo;)</p>
<p>The disciples in Qingyunmen, when they reach this level, will obviously show a watershed, and the qualifications are clear at a glance: the smart people are often like a broken bamboo, and they will break through into the higher &ldquo;dispelling&rdquo; realm in one fell swoop, and then lay a solid foundation for practicing the fairy road. , And the poorer disciples often stagnate, and there are many deserted ones.</p>
<p>It has been five years since Zhang Xiaofan got started. These things have naturally been listened to numerous times during conversations with fellow brethren, but it is obvious that all fellow brethren put him in the &ldquo;slightly worse&rdquo; category.</p>
<p>He walked back to the kitchen again, came to the stove, filled with water, and then continued to add firewood to the stove, preparing to boil some water. The bright yellow flame regained its strength. Zhang Xiaofan took his poor black &ldquo;burning stick&rdquo; that had been used for two years and fiddled with the firewood in the stove. After the fire steadily burned, his eyes slowly fell into his hands. On this burning stick.</p>
<p>But this is not what he found, but a very common thing-he is in a daze.</p>
<p>In addition to the round ball on the head, the black fire stick of the whole body is only one foot long. The only thing that is unusual is that under the black of the fire stick, there is a bloody vein in the faint, especially in the short stick and the round ball The interface is even more obvious. Sometimes it almost seems to make people feel that these two things are fused together with human blood.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan shook his body suddenly. The thought of the fusion of human blood flashed in his brain just now made him feel sick. Over the years, he has slowly forgotten that trip to the valley that year, but occasionally dreaming back at night, he will suddenly dream of that weird experience, and wake up sweating.</p>
<p>At that time he felt that he was very lonely, one faced with the unknown marauder, and one faced with the death of darkness. At this time, he was always unable to restrain his inexplicable emotions, with a hint of fanaticism, he couldn&rsquo;t help but feel a sense of killing. Even, in the dark, he recalled the strange fanaticism that Pu Zhi monk was looking at him by the broken grass temple many years ago!</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan didn&rsquo;t even know why he felt such a strange feeling, but fortunately he had another way to calm his horrified heart: Great Brahma Prajna!</p>
<p>This supreme method of Buddhism has the magical effect of deterring evil spirits and purifying the mind. He has practiced for five years, and his greatest use is to suppress the strange emotions that have appeared inexplicably in the past two years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Snapped&rdquo;!</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan had a pain in his head, and something fell to the ground, but it was a pine cone. Zhang Xiaofan rushed up angrily and turned back furiously: &ldquo;Dead monkey, don&rsquo;t let me catch&hellip; Hey, you are&hellip; Ah! Brother Six!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan jumped up and saw a man standing at the door with a medium build, capable face, full smile, and a small burden on his back. Who wasn&rsquo;t the old six Du Bishu who had not seen for a long time?</p>
<p>Du Bishu looked up and down at Zhang Xiaofan, and said in his mouth: &ldquo;Awesome, just a few years, your boy is as tall as I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan quickly walked up, grabbed Du Bishu&rsquo;s shoulders vigorously, and smiled: &ldquo;Six Brothers, why have we been here for so long, all of us miss you so much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Du Bishu smiled: &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan immediately asked: &ldquo;Master Master, Madam knows you are back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Du Bishu said: &ldquo;No, I just came back and saw that there is smoke in the kitchen here, so I came to see first, huh, huh, I know you guys are working here. I haven&rsquo;t seen you in a few years, do you miss me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was happy and nodded again and again. Du Bishu touched his head and suddenly whispered: &ldquo;Go, accompany me to see Master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan froze for a moment and said, &ldquo;Why should I go with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Du Bishu grimaced and said: &ldquo;Master had let me go down the mountain and said that it was a year better, but I played more, uh, no, I searched for more than half a year before I found good materials to make magic weapons, I&rsquo;m afraid To be scolded by Master. Come with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan glared at him and said, &ldquo;Then you said that you came to see me first, by the way, Brother Six, what magic weapon are you practicing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Du Bishugan smiled and said, &ldquo;Oh, of course, I will come to see you first, younger brother, let&rsquo;s go, let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo; He said, pulling Zhang Xiaofan away.</p>
<p>After a while, Rhubarb, who was hiding in a corner with a big bite of meat and bones, and little gray leaning on its back, scratching lice, heard a roar from Shou Jingtang: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so mad at me. !&rdquo;</p>
<p>At dinner, everyone at Dazhufeng reunited for the first time in two years and sat at a table to eat. After everyone settled down, Tian was not easy but he was still angry. After greeting Du Bishu, all the disciples couldn&rsquo;t help but quietly asked him: &ldquo;Lao Liu, why did Master get so angry when he saw you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Du Bi was embarrassed in writing and looked at him from the left and the right. Zhang Xiaofan sitting beside him had a smile on his face, but he didn&rsquo;t dare to laugh.</p>
<p>At this time, Tian Ling&rsquo;er, who was sitting opposite, finally couldn&rsquo;t help it. The first one asked Tian: &ldquo;Dad, Brother Six, it&rsquo;s hard to come back. Why are you still so angry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Du Bishu quietly raised his eyes and looked at Tian Duan, Tian Tian was not glaring at him, so Du Bishu quickly lowered his head. Tian Anhou snorted and said, &ldquo;Lao Liu, show your own magic weapon for everyone to see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Du Bishu opened his mouth, but he couldn&rsquo;t tell. He raised his eyes and looked at Su Ru, but he saw Su Ru and said with a smile: &ldquo;You must take it out and show it to everyone. Let everyone know how your master is angry. ?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seeing that Du Bishu couldn&rsquo;t postpone it, he took his little baggage with carelessness, shook it twice, took out a few things from the middle, and put it on the table.</p>
<p>Everyone did not blink one eye at a time, staring straight, fearing that something was missing, in the dining room, it was extremely quiet. I saw on the dining table there were three half-fist-sized things made of what seemed to be made of hard wood. They were square in six sides, white all over, and engraved with various points on the top, but they were three dice.</p>
<p>Everyone was dumb and speechless, and laughed out loud after a while.</p>
<p>Du Bishu&rsquo;s face was flushed, Tian was not easy to look at him, his face was angry, and his mouth was angry: &ldquo;The dead wood cannot be carved!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru smiled and shook his head at this moment, saying, &ldquo;Forget it, this is not a big deal, just dice it. Anyway, this magic weapon is also for his own use.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Yijian glared at the apprentice and said to Su Ru: &ldquo;How do you know he is not using this to deceive?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Du Bishu was taken aback and quickly said: &ldquo;Master, Master Niang, Tu&rsquo;er would never dare to do this shameless thing. It was just a year ago that I found a millennium three-bead tree on the bank of Chishui in the south (Note 1). Carved these three dice from their essence, it was completely on a whim, never thought of other&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian was not angry and he couldn’t stop, saying: &ldquo;You are happy, hum, you are practicing other things, but now you have made a set of gambling tools. After a month, the Seven Vessels will have a competitive test. Is there a face?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Du Bishu dare not say anything, Su Ru shook his head and whispered: &ldquo;Not easy, this is his own favorite, don&rsquo;t force him. You remember Brother Wan&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian was not shocked suddenly and turned his head to look at Su Ru. Su Ru sighed and said to Du Bi, &ldquo;You must know, Bi Shu. I and your master never forced you to be like other veins. Brothers practice the Immortal Sword, but the magic weapon is often very important. You have to be careful in yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Du Bishu took a peek at Tian Tian&rsquo;s difficulty, but he saw Master&rsquo;s face was unhappy, and he was sulking. No matter how dare to talk, he nodded repeatedly: &ldquo;Yes, yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru glanced at her husband again, and then said to everyone: &ldquo;The time passes really fast, and next month will be the seven-pulse Huiwu trial. We will go to Tongtianfeng where the Nagato is, and you will prepare earlier. ,&rdquo; Speaking of which, her beautiful and gentle face suddenly burst out and said sternly: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let me and your master be disappointed again this time, do you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the disciples jumped in their hearts and said in unison: &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Teacher, teacher, mother.&rdquo; Mixed in the loud answer of everyone, an uncoordinated weak voice came out. Su Ru looked and saw that it was the last old seven Zhang Xiaofan, frowned, said: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong, little Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan said cautiously: &ldquo;Then did you mean that I should go too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru was stunned and took a hard look at Tian, ​​with a smile on his face, and said with a smile: &ldquo;Yeah, aren&rsquo;t you also a disciple of Dazhufeng?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was overjoyed, cheered and jumped, and celebrated with Du Bishu next to him. Even though Tian was not easy to say in the distance, he said coldly: &ldquo;Anyway, there are nine places. Even if one is an idiot, one is still wasted, don&rsquo;t use it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>At night, Zhang Xiaofan returned to the house and saw that Da Huang and Xiao Hui had ran to their beds long ago. Since one and a half years ago, Rhubarb moved to Zhang Xiaofan’s room because of his good relationship with Xiaohui. At the beginning, he was scared that Tian was not easy to jump. He couldn’t find his dog everywhere. Whatever went away, Zhang Xiaofan saw that Master did not blame, and he did not chase out rhubarb (actually, he could not go out, one bed had half of rhubarb, and little gray accounted for half of it, so he could know the owner’s mood. Up).</p>
<p>However, after a long time, I am probably getting used to it or still getting familiar. Zhang Xiaofan no longer complains about rhubarb and ash sleeping with himself. This night, he is in a good mood. He walks into the room and sits at the table with his eyes. However, he saw that rhubarb was lying lazily, but Xiaohui had gone to the kitchen somehow, stole his black burning stick again, and rubbed it on rhubarb.</p>
<p>With a move in his heart, he felt that Xiao Hui seemed interested in this burning stick, but he was not in the mood to think so much now. His heart was completely filled with the joy that Master unexpectedly allowed him to participate in the Seven Vessels.</p>
<p>If Dahuang and Xiaohui look at Zhang Xiaofan at this time, they will see a human with glowing eyes. Zhang Xiaofan looked at the monkey and the dog, but his mouth seemed to be talking to the air: &ldquo;Look, I actually had the opportunity to participate in the Qimai Huiwu, which is great. Master, his old man is really generous, even if I am stupid Take me to a long experience, er, maybe you will see Jing Yu by then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Speaking of which, he seemed to remember something, and whispered to himself: &ldquo;But I really came to the stage to test, I&rsquo;m afraid I will be ashamed of Master. Forget it, just what you want. Rhubarb, little gray, Do you say that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Squeak!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan looked up, but he saw that the little discouragement was in rhubarb&rsquo;s fur, and he carefully grasped the lice, only called a few times to deal with him, and rhubarb was even more simple, even the two dog ears were put down, and they didn&rsquo;t look at it. Take a look at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dead dog!&rdquo; Zhang Xiaofan scolded indignantly, suddenly his eyes were black, but Xiao Hui suddenly smashed the burning stick in his hand. He was startled, quickly flashed away, and the fire stick hit the table, jumped twice, and fell to the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Squeak, squeaky!&rdquo; This time the voices of the big yellow dog and the little gray monkey became symphony. Zhang Xiaofan made a grimace at the two beasts and sat down bitterly. Somehow, his mind suddenly appeared again. Qi Hao&rsquo;s heroic posture on Dazhu Peak two years ago.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Condensing ice into a wall!&rdquo; Zhang Xiaofan said lowly, he was okay when he didn&rsquo;t practice, but these days he practiced deeper, but he deeply experienced the difficulties and unachievable to reach Qi Hao&rsquo;s realm.</p>
<p>He remembered that night, Tian Linger was beside the lights in this room, his tender but hot eyes!</p>
<p>His heart seemed to be pierced by a sharp needle at that moment.</p>
<p>The fire stick on the ground was lying there quietly, and the sound of monkeys and yellow dogs was heard beside him. Zhang Xiaofan suddenly felt that he was like this fire stick, even the fire stick fell to the ground, as if in his eyes. Also brought a bit of loneliness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas,&rdquo; he sighed, trying to imagine that he could reach that state, and then in a completely relaxed posture that he didn&rsquo;t care about, he made the Qingyunmen disciples countless times for the first time in his life. The &ldquo;dispelling&rdquo; action: waved to the fire stick on the ground.</p>
<p>At that moment, it seems to be forever.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was normal, not even sad, and was ready to accept his failure. Then, he saw the fire stick in the ground move.</p>
<p>It was so soft and subtle, it seemed like Shen Mian had woke up for a long time, and moved a bit!</p>
