      <p>In the distance behind, the roaring and fighting sound was heard all the time, and the light was shining. It was obvious that the three of Qingyun sect were fighting fiercely with other demons in the dark. But here, Zhang Xiaofan suddenly fell into a strange silence.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was stunned, but the owner of the Yellow flying sword and the gray tusk in the dark witnessed the strange scene with his own eyes. He was surprised. He didn&rsquo;t know what to do for a while?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wild dog, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m wrong. How could Jiang Laosan be sucked by others?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another man in the dark said in a thick voice and a thick airway: &ldquo;hell, someone in Qingyun sect can practice this&rdquo; blood sucking skill &ldquo;. Is this guy a disciple of our immortal sect</p>
<p>The original speaker &ldquo;Pooh&rdquo;, but after a while he couldn&rsquo;t say anything. He said angrily, &ldquo;no, this guy&rsquo;s background is strange. You must ask him clearly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two groups of light in front of Zhang Xiaofan brightened up, and gradually two figures appeared. Zhang Xiaofan returned to his mind and was shocked. He quickly put aside his thoughts and focused on the enemy.</p>
<p>In the light, the Yellow flying sword and the gray fangs flew back to the hands of the two people respectively. The one on the left went on to fly the sword. He was a tall and thin man with a thin face, a small Eagle nose and small eyes. His eyes were black and white with fierce light. The one on the other side was even more strange. Zhang Xiaofan was shocked when he looked at him. He was quite tall, but he looked very strange. His nose was out of the blue The ears are up, the lips are red, and one tongue seems to be quite long. From time to time, it stretches out its mouth, which looks like a dog. The gray tusk flew back to his hand. Zhang Xiaofan immediately thought subconsciously, isn&rsquo;t this the tooth of any big dog?</p>
<p>The man called wild dog saw Zhang Xiaofan and couldn&rsquo;t turn his eyes away. He was surprised and angry. He shouted: &ldquo;up! Why are you staring at you, little devil? &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The wild dog?&rdquo; Zhang Xiaofan frowned, and then found that the wild dog like man was actually a dark Taoist robe. It seems that he was the same religious sect as Qingyun sect, but he didn&rsquo;t know if he would have some origin in going back 3000 years.</p>
<p>The man who called himself wild dog Taoist was more annoyed at Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s obvious contempt. &ldquo;Little devil, I&rsquo;m asking you how to kill the vampire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What vampire?&rdquo; Zhang Xiaofan said</p>
<p>The tall one beside said angrily, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not the one on your back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan remembered that he was still carrying the body on his back, and felt the cool feeling on his neck.</p>
<p>Startled, he threw the body down, and with a thud, the man who had become a leather skull fell to the ground, and Zhang Xiaofan saw it. A fit of nausea, turned his head.</p>
<p>The wild dog Taoist and the tall man took a look at the skeleton, then looked at each other, both of them could see the meaning of surprise from each other&rsquo;s eyes. The blood sucking method is cruel and strange. Although it is severe, it also causes great damage to the body. After training, people are not like people or ghosts. Although they are members of the demon sect, they always stay away. But I still know a little about this mysterious skill.</p>
<p>However, the man in front of him, the only vampire who is known as the only successor of the blood sucking method, was drained of his whole blood essence in an instant. According to the two of them, this Taoist practice is far superior to the dead vampire Jiang Laosan, even the legendary blood sucking demon, even though it may not be so. But look at this young boy of Qingyun sect, he doesn&rsquo;t have that kind of strange and violent gas under the blood sucking sect.</p>
<p>The wild dog Taoist glanced at Zhang Xiaofan and said: &ldquo;you are a blood sucking old man Old master&rsquo;s door? &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was stunned and said, &ldquo;what kind of blood sucking elder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wild dog Taoist has a dog mouth, and his long tongue turns outside. Zhang Xiaofan can&rsquo;t help but think of the big dog rhubarb on the big bamboo peak of Qingyun Mountain. But in his second thoughts, he suddenly heard a scream from behind the cave and a flash of his sword. A man in black fell out of the darkness. His face was covered with blood. He struggled under the ground for several times. He was dead.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan suddenly realized that his fellow disciples were fighting to death, but he was here to talk with these demons. It&rsquo;s really confused. I&rsquo;ll get up at once and help you in the past.</p>
<p>The wild dog Taoist and the tall man were shocked to see Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s body move suddenly. They thought he was in trouble and hurried to be on guard. But they saw Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s body move, but suddenly they showed their teeth and fell off, half kneeling on the ground, breathing cool air, and the cold sweat on their forehead came out.</p>
<p>It turned out that Zhang Xiaofan was so worried that he forgot that the dark red fork was still inserted in the flesh and blood on his shoulder. The body moved, and immediately hurt his heart and spleen. The life fell again. The blood that had been stopped temporarily now flowed out of the torn wound.</p>
<p>Seeing this opportunity, how can the wild dog Taoist and the tall man miss it? They would rather kill the wrong person than let it go. The fierce light in their eyes and the swords and tusks in their hands shine again.</p>
<p>But at this time, there was a clear whistling from the rear. In the dark, there was a brilliant blue light. It was brilliant. All the lights were suppressed. In the blue light, only &ldquo;Tianya&rdquo; came out of its sheath proudly. In the middle of the air behind it, Lu Xueqi stood in the air with a unique demeanor. She was full of clothes and hunted and danced with the wind.</p>
<p>In the gape of the wild dog Taoist and the tall man, the blue light of the divine sword of Tianya exploded and turned into a huge blue light sword. When it was beheaded to the dark, it was immediately resisted by many miscellaneous lights, but when it was touched by the huge and pure blue light, it was annihilated. Only to hear strange calls, five or six figures jumped out of the shadow, &ldquo;boom&rdquo; a sound, blue lightsaber cut in the stone wall, the rubble flying in disorder, the power is amazing. And almost all of the people jumped out with their colors on. At the same time, the white light of Qi Hao&rsquo;s cold ice sword also brightened. Suddenly, it rushed out of the slant stab. When the sword crossed, several disciples of the demon sect became ice hockey sticks. And then Zeng shuyujian flew, smashing one of them to pieces.</p>
<p>The tall man in front of Zhang Xiaofan and the wild dog Taoist looked at each other. At the same time, he left Zhang Xiaofan and rushed up. The Yellow flying sword and the gray tusk were sacrificed at the same time, resisting the attack of Qi Hao and Zeng Shushu.</p>
<p>It seems that the two of them won the battle among all the demons, and immediately blocked the attack of Qi Hao and others, but they both cried together.</p>
<p>Originally, they spied that Qi Hao and others were attacked by bats last night. They set up an ambush in the deep part of the ancient cave. The protuberance broke the seemingly indestructible &ldquo;six mirror&rdquo; diaphragm shield, and then they broke each of the four Qingyun disciples. This plan was completed as scheduled. Unexpectedly, these disciples of Qingyun were unexpectedly tall and difficult to deal with.</p>
<p>In this ambush, the evil cult was originally led by the wild dog Taoist, the tall man and the vampire Jiang Laosan. They also saw that Zhang Xiaofan seemed to be the weakest of the four, so they asked three people to fight together, intending to solve Zhang Xiaofan quickly. Split up against the other three. Unexpectedly, things were strange. Although Zhang Xiaofan was injured, the vampire, Jiang Laosan, was mysteriously drained and died.</p>
<p>At the moment, although they temporarily stopped Qi Hao and Zeng Shushu, there was a beautiful woman with a blue strange sword on her side. Although the stinky boy was injured behind him, it was very strange. In case the two of them came up together, the situation would be very bad. After two rounds of fighting, Lu Xueqi injured several disciples of the demon sect.</p>
<p>Looking back, the dog Taoist shouted: &ldquo;run!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tall man beside him has a close relationship with his heart. He withdraws his magic weapon at the same time, attaches himself to it, brushes twice, and escapes to the deep cave. Other disciples of the demon sect saw it and fled with a scream.</p>
<p>Qihao made up his mind and shouted, &ldquo;go after those two people.&rdquo; Say the sword and go straight after it. Zeng Shushu follows him closely. Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s blue Tianya light turns and is about to catch up with him. Suddenly, something comes to her mind. She is about to turn around, but suddenly she sees Zhang Xiaofan rising from the sky with a fire stick shining with black and blue light. Her shoulder is bleeding, but the dark red fork inserted in his shoulder has been pulled out.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan flies forward. Lu Xueqi looks at his figure as if he is stunned. Just followed up again.</p>
<p>This chase in the cave is somewhat like that of Zhang Xiaofan and Tian linger chasing monkey Xiaohui in the back mountain of Dazhu peak. It&rsquo;s very strange and twists and turns. Suddenly, you go left. Hur right, HuR straight up to the sky, HuR straight down to the bottom of the ground, and later it was a fork in the road, but the four people of Qingyun gate didn&rsquo;t care so much, just looked at the yellow and gray light in front of them. Keep on chasing.</p>
<p>The grotesque rocks and peaks in the cave are abrupt. Zhang Xiaofan is closely behind his classmates, and he is absorbed in driving the fire stick. Later, in some places, it is almost narrow enough for only one person to pass through. Zhang Xiaofan can&rsquo;t be afraid to think about it at all. With a roar, he even passed through. This chase turned into six lights in the dark of the cave. It was so fast that Zhang Xiaofan felt that the wind and the dark seemed to be intertwined, and he kept fighting in front of him.</p>
<p>This chase lasted another half an hour. The wild dog Taoist and the other two were familiar with the terrain. Although they didn&rsquo;t get rid of the four haunted guys behind them, they didn&rsquo;t get close.</p>
<p>Suddenly, there was a light in the distance ahead of them, and the wild dog Taoist and the tall man immediately flew to them with all their strength. Qi Hao and others followed closely. Zhang Xiaofan followed them, only feeling the pain in his shoulder gradually receding. Just now, he pulled out the fork with great pain, and even he was surprised. Although his shoulder is painful, his body is full of Qi and blood. It seems that he can&rsquo;t use up all his strength. But once he thinks of the scene just now, his heart will be cold and cold into the bone marrow when he thinks of the word &ldquo;sucking blood&rdquo; that the wild dog Taoist said.</p>
<p>The light in front, more and more close, more and more bright, six people, such as the arrow from the string, rushed to the light.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>The light, like the devilish flowers blooming suddenly in the dark, lights up people&rsquo;s eyes. Zhang Xiaofan jumped into the light with the crowd. When he saw the light in front of him, he was shocked by the situation.</p>
<p>It turns out that the last place they chased was a spacious and straight passage. Outside the passage, it was an incredible huge space. The top of the head was the rock cave top, and the foot was the ground. On the ground not far in front of them, there was a huge stone with strong light, illuminating the whole space.</p>
<p>But the most surprising thing is not the fast Boulder, but behind it, in the deep light, is a huge abyss that suddenly opens. The light from this boulder lights up the dome of the cave, but it seems that it can&rsquo;t go into the abyss half a minute behind it. From the air, it&rsquo;s dark, even the other end of the abyss can&rsquo;t be seen, only a dead and gloomy one dark.</p>
<p>There are three people standing in front of the boulder at the moment. One is a big man with beard, another is a pretty young woman, and the other is a young man with a pale face and white clothes. His face is evil. The wild dog Taoist and his high companion fell down and stood in front of the boulder. Qi Hao saw in his eyes that all of them were strange in appearance. He dared not be careless. He called his classmates and fell five feet away from the stone.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan stood still and looked at it. He saw that there were three big characters carved on the strange and shining stone in ancient seal script, dragon flying and Phoenix dancing</p>
<p>The abyss of death!</p>
<p>Seeing the four people of Qingyun gate fall down, the few people standing under the boulder have no movement, only a bearded man frowns. &ldquo;Wild dog, Liu Hao, you are too bad. You meet some young people of Qingyun. Even in such a mess, they are led to the abyss of death! &quot;</p>
<p>The wild dog Taoist&rsquo;s dog face was red, just about to distinguish. A middle-aged young woman standing behind the big man looked at them and suddenly shrieked, &ldquo;where&rsquo;s the third ginger?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wild dog took a look at the people of Qingyun gate. &ldquo;He died under them,&rdquo; he said</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; These people, who had been as stable as Mount Tai, moved one after another, but it didn&rsquo;t seem that they could kill Jiang Laosan for the sake of Qingyun sect&rsquo;s humanity. The young woman was stunned, shook her head, and said, &ldquo;this time, the old blood sucking demon will be investigated. We can&rsquo;t explain it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bearded man pondered for a moment, turned around and looked at the people of Qingyun gate, and said, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s take these Qingyun children and give them to the blood sucking elder, that is to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Others nodded yes. Qi Hao saw how big they were. More carefully, he whispered to the three humanitarians behind him: &ldquo;these people seem to be the leading figures of the devil cult here. I&rsquo;m afraid that Taoism is still on top of those people just now, so we should be careful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan responds with a sound, turns his head, suddenly sees Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s eyes sweep over the wound on his shoulder, he is slightly stunned, Lu Xueqi then looks away.</p>
<p>At this time, the big man took a step forward and said to all the people of Qingyun gate: &ldquo;I advise you to arrest them. Otherwise, when we do, you will break your bones and tendons and suffer from skin and flesh! &quot;</p>
<p>Qi Hao snorted and didn&rsquo;t speak. After hearing this, Lu Xueqi said coldly, &ldquo;the devil and the clown dare to be crazy. Today is the time for you to die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Qi Hao and Zeng Shushu clapped at the same time and said, &ldquo;sister Lu said well, that&rsquo;s exactly what she said!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The big man&rsquo;s face changed like frost. Coldly said: &ldquo;this is your own death!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t see how he acted, but I just stared at the four people. Zhang Xiaofan was on his guard. Suddenly, he saw that in the normal eyes of the big man, his right eye suddenly doubled and turned red. The whole huge eye was on his face, terrible and funny.</p>
<p>He was in a strange place in his heart. Suddenly, the big man&rsquo;s red eyes shot out a red awn, and came to him quickly. All the people in Qingyun sect thought that he looked strange, and they had long kept their heart. Qi Hao immediately offered a cold ice immortal sword, &ldquo;Ka Ka&rdquo; two times, and built two ice walls in front of him.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the red awn seemed to contain the force of ferocity. After a while, it hit on the ice wall. In a moment, it melted a small hole in the ice wall and went straight through it, but it rushed over like a broken bamboo without any sound.</p>
<p>Qi Hao was shocked. He had no time to react. He immediately put the cold ice fairy sword in front of the people. The red light hit the cold ice fairy sword, flashed two times, and disappeared in the white light of the cold ice fairy sword. However, Qi Hao shivered and saw a small piece of pure white sword with a light dark red color.</p>
<p>The body of the cold ice sword quivers slightly. It seems that it has been attacked by evil things. Qi Hao&rsquo;s heart aches greatly. In fact, the person who cultivates the truth doesn&rsquo;t attach great importance to his magic weapon. But at the moment, he couldn&rsquo;t bear to think more. The red awn had just disappeared, and another red awn was launched from the red eyes of the big man in the distance. When he collided with the two ice walls, he broke two holes without any sound and the momentum was not reduced. He hit four people.</p>
<p>Qi Hao frowned tightly, and the cold ice sword was shining white. He rushed to meet him in the air. In an instant, he dissipated the red light into invisibility, but there was another red mark on the body of the cold ice sword.</p>
<p>In the distance, the big man didn&rsquo;t say a word. In the red eyes, he shot out the red light like an arrow. The speed was extremely fast. In a twinkling of an eye, Qi Hao blocked them one by one. But seeing that the dark red color was more and more, the white light of the cold ice fairy sword was gradually dim.</p>
<p>The three people nearby all saw that it was not good. Zeng Shushu was the first one to rush out and take up his magic sword, Xuanyuan. He was about to rush up from the side. Unexpectedly, the big man only turned his head slightly, and a red light shot out of his red eyes came to him. Zeng Shushu couldn&rsquo;t dodge, so he had to sacrifice Xuanyuan Xianjian in the air to block the strange red light.</p>
<p>In the middle of the sky, Xuanyuan fairy sword glowed with a light purple light, which immediately eliminated the red light. But on the body of the sword, there was a red mark like a bone attached cone, and Xuanyuan fairy sword immediately gave out a shiver.</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu felt that there was a sudden evil spirit coming from the sword, which seemed to invade the body, but fortunately, it was far away, and the power was not strong, and Xuanyuan fairy sword itself immediately lifted up auspicious Qi to offset the evil spirit.</p>
<p>However, he couldn&rsquo;t go any further. Looking at the big man in the distance, he just stood leisurely in the same place and waved his head slightly. The red giant eye kept emitting red light, so he nailed Qi Hao and Zeng Shushu in the same place and couldn&rsquo;t move forward inch by inch. With the red mark gradually increasing, the two felt that the evil spirit from the immortal sword was getting heavier and heavier, and took the immortal sword body as the medium, and slowly turned to the immortal sword The two of them came in. (to be continued. )</p>
