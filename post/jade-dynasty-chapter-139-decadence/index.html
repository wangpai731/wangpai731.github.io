      <p>A hundred thousand mountains, an ancient cave.</p>
<p>After the resurrection of the demon demon suppressing cave, the scene is quite different from that of the previous dark clouds and the howling wind. Although the sky is still dark, the black air gathered in the cave has dissipated, and the wind blowing from the cave has disappeared all year round.</p>
<p>In addition to the still barren mountains, only the statue woman standing at the entrance of Zhenmo ancient cave is still standing there. In front of it, dressed in bright silk clothes, is a very handsome, even with a trace of seductive youth.</p>
<p>On her face, which is whiter than ordinary women&rsquo;s, her eyebrows and eyes are thin and her lips are sharp and her jaw is sharp. If you look closely, this face is vaguely similar to that stone statue woman.</p>
<p>But, in two people&rsquo;s facial features on the temperament, but very different!</p>
<p>This young man was a demon who was resurrected from the ancient cave of demons. No one would have expected that such a beautiful young man would be the devil who frightened countless people in southern Xinjiang.</p>
<p>From the day of resurrection, for some reason, he did nothing, neither killing nor roaring with ecstasy, but he just stood in front of the stone statue of the exquisite Witch and gazed in silence.</p>
<p>The shadow flashed by, and the Lich floated silently from the distance and came to the young man&rsquo;s back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord beast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Young body motionless, head also does not return, way: &ldquo;how?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Lich gazed at his back and said, &ldquo;the thirteen demon kings have taken all the barbarians left in the mountains and obeyed the orders of the God of beasts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The youth&rsquo;s body this just moved, turn round slowly, light way: &ldquo;how many families are left altogether?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Lich said: &ldquo;now there are only 37 tribes. In the past hundred years, there were no leaders in the mountains, and many barbarians killed each other, and many of them were destroyed. &quot;</p>
<p>The young man smiles coldly, and there is no disappointment on his face. On the contrary, he has a rebellious feeling from his heart, and his eyes are like electricity. Around the Lich&rsquo;s veiled face.</p>
<p>The Lich suddenly felt as if he had been burned by fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In fact, it should be from 38 ethnic groups,&rdquo; the young man said leisurely. &ldquo;Are you the last descendant of the black witch clan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Lich bowed its head and was silent.</p>
<p>The young man turned his head slowly, and his eyes fell again on the face of the exquisite witch statue. After staring for a long time, he suddenly called out, &ldquo;black wood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Lich was shocked.</p>
<p>The name seemed to him like a wound engraved in his heart. Every time it was called, it would hurt him once.</p>
<p>Just listen to that young man looking at the Linglong stone statue, the tone suddenly a little bit more vicissitudes, the way: &ldquo;so many years, in front of Linglong, do you have any regret?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Lich was silent and whispered for a long time, &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The youth also does not turn back, in one eye twinkles the strange light. Circulation does not stop, secluded way: &ldquo;in this world, in addition to your big brother who becomes a fierce spirit, only you know the relationship between me and Linglong. In those days, eight of you chased me through thousands of mountains and rivers. Now I think of it as if it was yesterday. &quot;</p>
<p>The body under the black veil of the Lich suddenly began to tremble slightly. It seemed that the past was still in his mind.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that teenager, but he doesn&rsquo;t pay attention to the Lich&rsquo;s reaction. What he said was not so much to the Lich as to the statue, in his eyes. At the moment, there is only the stone statue of the exquisite witch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You,&rdquo; he said, with a little sadness, sadness and indignation, &ldquo;what are you for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stone statue stands silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In your heart, what is the world. What fate is so important? &quot; The young man&rsquo;s voice, suddenly a little excited, slowly become bigger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you think that&rsquo;s more important than I am, so you&rsquo;re going to get rid of me, right?&rdquo; &ldquo;But you know, I don&rsquo;t care at all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the hell is the will of heaven, what are the creatures in the world?&rdquo; His expression became more and more desolate, and it was strange that, in spite of the terrible expression in his eyes, his appearance became more and more charming and beautiful, hardly like ordinary people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you want me dead, just say it, you know? Do you know? &quot; He growled at the statue, and then, slowly, his voice fell,</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why How can you see those things more important than yourself and your own life&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>Slowly, he reached out his hand and gently stroked his face, which had experienced countless years of wind and frost erosion, and gradually rough face. He brushed his once gentle face in his deep memory!</p>
<p>The cold feeling, without a trace of warmth, came slowly from the palm of the hand.</p>
<p>Open arms, gently embrace, will hold the stone in the arms, the expression of the young gradually become a strange gentle.</p>
<p>The Lich stood behind, silently watching the strange scene.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that it is the common people in this world who have harmed you.&rdquo; The young man half closed his eyes and said in a soft voice, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;ll let all the things come to bury for you. Then, I&rsquo;ll find you again&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wait for me&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Low voice, quietly low and finally disappeared. The enchanting youth hugged the cold stone statue, the Lich in black stood up, the dark clouds in the sky thundered, and raindrops fell from the sky.</p>
<p>The heavy rain fell in the wind, making the world hazy. Faintly, the Lich was staring, and the raindrops fell on the stone woman&rsquo;s face and slipped silently——</p>
<p>Like tears!</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Qingyun Mountain is 3000 miles east. The ancient road extending from kongsang mountain to the southeast is a quiet wilderness. It is the season of grass growing and warblers flying.</p>
<p>One day away from Xiaochi Town, he&rsquo;s a small shop, standing alone beside the ancient road to greet and see off the travelers. The owner of the small shop, Mr. He, naturally can&rsquo;t remember how many guests and passers-by were welcomed and sent by. Naturally, there are all kinds of things. But in these three days, he gradually affirmed that although he was getting older, he must remember such a guest.</p>
<p>In fact, it is not accurate to say that it is a guest. In fact, it should be a guest with a strange monkey. What&rsquo;s more, for boss he, what impressed him was that the strange looking monkey with three eyes actually played a bigger role.</p>
<p>Three days ago, boss he, who was standing outside the shop next to the ancient road, saw this man with a dusty face and a blank face coming from the ancient road. He didn&rsquo;t know why after he saw a three eyed monkey lying on his shoulder. I feel a little familiar. At that time, he went forward. He wanted to talk a lot about it and drag the guest into the shop for a rest, but he only said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My guest, we have hot tea and wine. It&rsquo;s better to go inside and have a rest&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>Before the words in the back of the story were spoken, the man who looked very haggard suddenly disappeared from his eyes. The next moment, when boss he regained his mind, the man was already sitting beside the wooden table in his shop. And on the table. If you lose a piece of silver, you can eat and drink for three days in this shop.</p>
<p>Naturally, boss he was very happy and hastened to serve wine and food. However, to his surprise, the guest and the monkey stayed in his shop for three days and three nights. To this day, it seems that they have no intention of going on the road.</p>
<p>That man&rsquo;s spirit, obviously very bad, between three days. Boss he did not see him say a word and smile once. Every time when he brought food and wine to the table, the man just looked at the kettle silently and drank slowly.</p>
<p>It seems that the guest&rsquo;s drinking capacity is very poor. Every time he drinks a little, boss he estimates that it is less than half a pot, and the whole person falls unconscious on the wine table. And contrary to the owner, the man brought the three eyed monkey, but boss he was surprised.</p>
<p>To be honest, boss he opens a shop here. Although the place is remote, but because there are many merchants in the past, it can be regarded as a somewhat knowledgeable person, but within the past three days. He has vowed innumerable times in his heart that he really saw the monkey who could drink the most and drink the most in his life.</p>
<p>It was just a day and a night. All the wine in boss he&rsquo;s shop, including a jar of red liquor for his daughter, which he hid under the old locust tree behind the shop, was drunk by the monkey.</p>
<p>And this monkey, obviously, is still in a state of unfinished business. Catch ear to scratch cheek, look around, jump for a long time, toward boss he &ldquo;squeak&rdquo; constantly. Although boss he doesn&rsquo;t speak monkey language, a fool can also see the meaning of this monkey. He didn&rsquo;t want to pay attention to it. Unexpectedly, the monkey was as clever as a ghost. He stole back the money he had collected and swayed around in front of boss he.</p>
<p>Boss he can&rsquo;t help it. What&rsquo;s more, other people have already paid enough money, so they have to send some wine from Xiaochi town all night. At first, he was quite angry, but after a long time, he fell in love with the monkey. Besides, this three eyed monkey has no other bad places besides drinking. On the contrary, he often plays in the shop. When he is in a good mood, he even plays a few juggling. For example, he can produce a bunch of things in the fire from his hands. Not only is boss he&rsquo;s eyes straight, but also other merchants who pass by these days are all in high spirits, especially in boss he&rsquo;s shop After staying for a long time, he made more money.</p>
<p>However, the owner of the grey haired three eyed monkey is quite different from the lively monkey. Most of the time, he sleeps in the air of wine. Once in a while, he just looks around with his eyes blankly. Occasionally, the monkey runs back to his side. He reaches out to touch the monkey&rsquo;s head lazily, and then he seems to think of something sad. He picks up the wine pot and drinks again Come on, after a while, then again indulge in the dreamland.</p>
<p>Sometimes boss he secretly thought that this man would not be a madman. It&rsquo;s just that although he is just an ordinary shopkeeper, he still feels the difference between this man and other passers-by. What&rsquo;s more, in the past three days when the man stayed in the shop, all the mosquitoes that used to be the most popular at this time of the night suddenly disappeared. What&rsquo;s more, every night in the past, the sound of crying ghosts often echoed in the wilderness of the ancient road outside the shop seemed to be frightened by something, and all disappeared. So that boss he is used to these ghosts crying and howling, suddenly these three days so quiet, he could not sleep.</p>
<p>At dusk of this day, boss he stood behind the counter of the shop, closed the account book just calculated, and sighed for a long time. Then he looked into his shop.</p>
<p>The setting sun outside the window still has a light residual light, which makes the sky red and the sunset glow red. At the same time, it also shines in from the window of the shop, stretching the tables and chairs here, reflecting the shadow on the ground, as if the time was passing by quietly here.</p>
<p>Boss he&rsquo;s mood is suddenly a little different. He&rsquo;s lost for a while. He&rsquo;s already over 50. Although the assistant always said that he was only about 40, he knew that his health was getting worse.</p>
<p>The years do not forgive people, so spent a lifetime?</p>
<p>He was staring at the growing shadows of tables and chairs on the ground. When he looked up, he saw the mottled marks on the walls of the shop.</p>
<p>The silent setting sun. His face has some indescribable pictures in the world.</p>
<p>He sighed and shook his head, these things. Don&rsquo;t think about it. Boss he grinned bitterly, picked up the account book and went to the only guest and his monkey in the shop at the moment.</p>
<p>The guest was always sitting at the innermost table, and now, as usual, he was drunk on the table, motionless. And his monkey was squatting on the table. The left hand holds the wine pot, and the right hand grasps the delicious food from the dishes on the table. After a sip of wine and a mouthful of vegetables, the life is very delicious.</p>
<p>Boss he went to the guest, coughed and cleared his throat. But his eyes could not help but look at the monkey first. He saw three eyes. Obviously, the monkey didn&rsquo;t care about his arrival and only looked at him. I&rsquo;m back on the jug. Boss he sighed. This monkey is really the only one in his life who is so addicted to alcohol. Besides, there is a big wine bag on its back. Although it has been shriveled, you can imagine what it contained in it in the past.</p>
<p>Boss he took back his eyes. Somehow, he was a little nervous. He coughed a few times and then cautiously said, &ldquo;this My guest</p>
<p>The man in front of him did not move.</p>
<p>Boss he is a little embarrassed. But he went on: &ldquo;Er, my guest, it&rsquo;s like this. You paid that ingot of silver three days ago. Now it&rsquo;s used up. Our shop is a small profit, isn&rsquo;t it&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>The man didn&rsquo;t know if he was really drunk. He was lying there, or nothing happened.</p>
<p>Boss he sighed and said, &ldquo;actually. My guest, you paid a lot of silver. If you eat three days in a small shop, five days is enough. It&rsquo;s just It&rsquo;s just that the noble animal is too strong and has too much wine. In the past three days, he has already drunk all the wine stored in the shop, and the four jars of wine sent by other people twice have been drunk by him&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>Boss he said here, and looked at the monkey three eyes, but the monkey glared at him, made a face.</p>
<p>Boss he said in a low voice: &ldquo;could you please pay some more silver? Er, by the way, the ingot of silver you paid three days ago was stolen by the noble animals, but it has not been returned so far. I&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before he finished speaking, he only heard the sound of Ding. A ding of silver jumped twice on the table and appeared in front of boss he. Boss he fixed his eyes on it, but the monkey didn&rsquo;t know where he found the ingot stolen silver and threw it in his face.</p>
<p>Boss he quickly put it away, received it in his arms, but hesitated for a moment, took a look at the monkey, took the money out, opened his shirt, and put it in his personal clothes.</p>
<p>Just as he had collected the money and was going to speak to the man again, a voice came from the door of the shop</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is anyone here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Boss he was stunned and looked back. There were three people standing at the door, two men and one woman. The first one was an old man, with a bamboo pole in his hand and a piece of white cloth with the words &ldquo;immortal guiding the way&rdquo;. Beside him, there was a girl of seventeen or eight years old, with a beautiful appearance and a smile on her face.</p>
<p>Behind them, a middle-aged man with all the parcels was born strangely. His stature was more than a head higher than the first two, but his face was like a wild dog. He was disgusted with the sight.</p>
<p>Boss he quickly welcomed up, after all, the guests with the monkey can&rsquo;t sneak away. It&rsquo;s better to greet the new guests first. He said with a smile: &ldquo;yes, yes, three guests. Would you like to have dinner or stay in the hotel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The head of that old man ha ha smile, squint eyes smile way: &ldquo;how, boss he, don&rsquo;t know us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As one of them, boss he looked at the old man carefully for a while, but he could not remember that he was doing business by the ancient road. How many passers-by could remember him one by one, he had to shake his head in embarrassment and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, sir, I&rsquo;m getting old and I can&rsquo;t remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man looked compassionate, shook his head and sighed: &ldquo;Alas, it&rsquo;s a pity, it&rsquo;s a pity that most ordinary people in the world are like this. There are fairies in front of him, but he has no insight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Boss he was startled and awed. After a close look at the old man, he saw that he had white beard and crane bone fairy wind. Most of them were masters of Taoism. Although he didn&rsquo;t know why the Taoist master looked like a monk in the lake, and the young girl around the old man looked disapproving, he thought that since he was an expert, he naturally could not understand it. If he understood it, wouldn&rsquo;t he become an expert?</p>
<p>Thinking of this, boss he&rsquo;s face has been a little more respectful, respectfully said: &ldquo;yes, yes, this guest No, master, please come in. &quot;</p>
<p>The old man agreed and swaggered in with the bamboo pole pointing the way by the immortal. The girl behind him laughed bitterly and shook her head, then turned to the man with the package on his back and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Taoist wild dog, let&rsquo;s go in and have a rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man answered and followed in. The three men sat down at a table. The dog faced man put his package on the chair beside him. It seemed that the weight was not light.</p>
<p>These three people, of course, were Monday immortal and Xiao Huan yesun. As for the dog face man, he was the only wild dog Taoist in the blood refining hall. Since the end of the battle of the dead marsh, the wild dog Taoist followed Monday immortal and Xiaohuan two people, wandering the world, home.</p>
<p>At the beginning, Zhouxian was not very pleased with wild dogs. He was always criticizing wild dogs. However, the Taoist priest of wild dogs, for some reason, seemed to have changed his mind and changed his personality again. Even if he didn&rsquo;t hear of it, he still followed him all the way. Xiaohuan was kind-hearted and could not see through it. He had more words to defend.</p>
<p>Although she is young, she has sharp teeth and sharp mouth. Although she is an old man in the world, she is often said to be speechless. Finally, she has to accept this fact. Fortunately, as time went on, he gradually realized that wild dogs were not worthless. For example, all the heavy parcels he usually needed to carry could be thrown to this coolie. Moreover, in Xiaohuan&rsquo;s apologetic eyes, coolie did not have the slightest antipathy, but was very happy.</p>
<p>As for other benefits, such as wild animals in the wild, ghosts on the way, strong people across the mountain, etc., naturally, the wild dog &ldquo;great Xia&rdquo; was sent to settle the situation. All the way down, Monday immortal felt very comfortable. Tianya road has been walking for a lifetime, but he has never been as comfortable as these months. I just wish I had met a wild dog earlier.</p>
<p>During this period, the three of them revisited their hometown. In any case, they were wandering around the world and could go anywhere. They walked and walked back to the ancient road. He also lost a lot of money. He even remembered that boss he, who opened a small shop on the roadside, dressed up as an expert and made boss he look surprised.</p>
<p>Seeing that boss he was respectful to himself, Xian Da was very proud on Monday and ordered several dishes. When boss he quickly walked away to prepare, he turned around and was about to boast to Xiao Huan and Taoist wild dog. However, he suddenly saw that the faces of Taoist Xiao Huan and wild dog suddenly appeared an incredible expression and his eyes were thumping.</p>
<p>On Monday, Xianqi said, &ldquo;Hello, what&rsquo;s the matter with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wild dog Taoist raised his arm, which seemed to have become a little heavy, and pointed to the deep inside of the shop: &ldquo;you can see for yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Monday fairy glared at him, turned his head to see, suddenly the body is also a shock.</p>
<p>In the twilight, the last ray of light fell from the window. In the dark corner of the shop, there was a figure of a man. On the table, in the shadow, a three eyed monkey was looking at them.</p>
<p>Xiaohuan was shocked and gave a low cry</p>
