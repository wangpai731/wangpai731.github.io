<p>Zhang Xiaofan never thought that he would open his eyes to see such a world.</p>
<p>Everything in front of him was not a cave hidden in the deep of the mountain in his imagination. In front of him, it was another ancient, desolate and strange place.</p>
<p>In front of him, there were no trees, flowers and plants, only dark gray rocks and sand. The strong wind blew over the Gobi with a whistling sound. Overhead, is a strange sky, dark purple thick clouds pressure the world as if breathless, in the clouds, there is a huge white lightning split from the sky, leaping across the sky.</p>
<p>The farthest horizon in the distance is a dark green halo. The special brightness there is like a bright light at the end of the darkness. There are countless meteors passing through the sky, emitting blazing and dazzling light. In the sky, it turns into brilliant and spectacular star language.</p>
<p>After a while, Zhang Xiaofan slowly withdrew his eyes, and his shock gradually calmed down. Looking forward, there was an altar not far ahead of him. There was a huge dark gray stone seat. There were steps on all eight sides. There were seven columns on the altar, which were divided into seven colors. Each one was ten feet high. It took three people to encircle it. Ordinary people were on the altar, It looks as small as a mole ant. In the center of the altar, there is an ancient tripod, but at the moment, there is a man with his back against the ancient tripod. His face is full of fatigue. He looks very old and looks like Zhang Xiaofan.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s body was shocked. It seems that he is an extremely old man. He is the real person of the master daoxuan of Qingyun gate.</p>
<p>At the moment, there is no cold and black air around him. It seems that he is still panting in a low voice. Seeing the ghost coming, he suddenly smiles and says: &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe that you can walk through the magic moon road by yourself. It&rsquo;s amazing.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was silent for a moment. He turned around and saw a stone gate towering at his place of origin. Different from the desolate scenery of the world around him, there was darkness in the stone gate, which was one meter high and six feet wide. Looking from a distance, it seemed that there was still a layer of whirling water mist, as if the passage was not long.</p>
<p>But Zhang Xiaofan looked at the darkness and recalled the scene just now, but after a while, he had a faint smile on his mouth and turned around again to look at daoxuanxuan.</p>
<p>In front of him, it can be said that he directly killed Tian, the most respected teacher in his life, and indirectly killed Su Ru, the teacher&rsquo;s mother. However, at the moment, he looked weak but had no anger at all, but Zhang Xiaofan seemed to have no desire for revenge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you ok?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>He walked slowly to daoxuan immortal, quietly.</p>
<p>Daoxuan looked at him, and a strange smile appeared on his tired face. Instead of asking him about his past gratitude and resentment, he asked, &ldquo;why did you come here?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan is silent for a moment, light way: &ldquo;I think should come, come.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Taoist immortal looked at him and began to laugh. He laughed more and more loudly. He shook his head and said with a smile: &ldquo;the one who should come will come. Ha ha ha ha&hellip;&rdquo; He laughs wantonly and crazily, as if affectionate also gradually fierce, Zhang Xiaofan did not go to ask more, also did not interrupt him, just looked at quietly.</p>
<p>After a long time, the laughter of Taoist immortal stopped slowly. His face was still very tired, but the strange light in his eyes began to be sharp and bright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want to avenge your master?&rdquo; Daoxuan immortal suddenly said to him.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan didn&rsquo;t answer. He still looked at daoxuan immortal quietly. His eyes were calm and peaceful, as if with a faint compassion. However, Xiaohui, the monkey in his arms, seemed to be a little uneasy. He moved twice, left his arms and climbed onto his shoulder again.</p>
<p>The body of immortal daoxuan seemed to shake slightly. His face also changed slowly. His tired expression gradually disappeared. The fierce light in his eyes became more and more bright. Once the arrogant momentum of the world, as if the tide, quickly back to his body.</p>
<p>That terrible and invisible force, even if Zhang Xiaofan stands aside, can clearly feel from daoxuan real person&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p>He slowly stood up, a wisp of black gas came out of his body, around which he whirled rapidly, and the violent breath reappeared. He stared at Zhang Xiaofan and laughed again, but the smile seemed ferocious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still. Are you afraid.</p>
<p>Suddenly, there was a loud noise, which burst out behind the real man daoxuan. At that moment, the ancient tripod was smashed by a huge force, and the pieces splashed everywhere. In the smoke, the pupils of Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s eyes slightly contracted.</p>
<p>A broken sword, in the original position of the ancient tripod, was inserted upside down on a hard stone base. It looked like stone instead of stone, like jade instead of jade. It was in an ancient and clumsy form, but it had a sense of dignity. It was awe inspiring to formally kill the immortal ancient sword.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha ha ha ha&hellip;&rdquo; At the moment, the thick black air is already reading and covering the real man daoxuan. In the laughter, he reaches out his hand and, like being spiritually, shakes the ancient sword of Zhuxian, slowly pulls it out, flies off the ground and falls into the hands of immortal daoxuan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since you are so useless, let me send you to see your master. Ha ha ha&hellip;&rdquo; Immortal daoxuan clenched the handle of the ancient sword to kill the immortals. In a moment, the whole huge altar trembled, and a full force burst out. On the altar, the seven huge stone pillars seemed to be summoned and lit up one by one, and the light became more and more prosperous,.</p>
<p>Finally, it turned into seven colorful red lights, dazzling, straight into the sky.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the thick clouds above the altar changed. Countless clouds began to rotate rapidly. The lights flickered one after another in the clouds. A huge gap opened slowly, revealing the true features of the sky.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan looked up to the sky and held his breath. Until now, he really understood why this place was called &ldquo;magic moon cave&rdquo;!.</p>
<p>In the high sky, the crack of Hongguang driven by Zhuxian Gujian was revealed.</p>
<p>A flickering moon, red, orange, yellow, green, green, blue, purple, all kinds of colors of brilliance are flashing on this magic moon, emitting beautiful and mysterious light.</p>
<p>When Zhuxian ancient sword drives seven huge pillars to shoot up into the sky, the seven color rainbow light passes through the clouds and merges into the moon. Suddenly, the magic moon is full of brilliance, and the seven color light is flashing. After a moment, a colorful Qi sword appears in the air. Everywhere, all the dark clouds are evading and disappearing, which has a great prestige.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s face changed. He was so familiar with this situation that it was the invincible sword array for killing immortals. But there was no stingy sword flying all over the sky at present. However, under the light of the moon, the power of the main sword seemed to be greater than that of the immortal killing sword array on the seven pulse mountain peaks on that day.</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan&rsquo;s eyes and eyebrows were completely covered in the black air at the moment. The icy laughter came from it, and it was even more chilling. &ldquo;In the magic moon cave, the magic power of the ancient sword for killing immortals has been increased ten times. Please be a big Luo Jinxian, and also a place where you can die without being buried. Die!&rdquo;.</p>
<p>As soon as the words fell, the ancient sword of killing immortals in his hand had already been waved. In an instant, the sky and the earth changed color, and the thunder exploded in the sky. The terrible sword above the sky turned slowly to Zhang Xiaofan.</p>
<p>Before the sword fell, the strong wind had arrived. Zhang Xiaofan knew that the power of destroying the heaven and the earth could not be connected by human force. He wanted to dodge when he was in a vertical position. Unexpectedly, the moon was shining in the sky. As soon as his body was moving, a rainbow light had already been covered, which pushed him back. After the pressure, he could not stand still and knelt down slowly Go down. Standing on the ground, the sound of the underground &ldquo;click Ka Ka Ka&rdquo; is heard. The ground is cracked in the twinkling of an eye with Zhang Xiaofan as the center.</p>
<p>After the ancient sword of Zhuxian is broken, its power seems to be more powerful than before under the illusory moon. With this terrible power, even if the Real Da Luojin immortal comes here, it will be destroyed. But how can such terrible power exist in the world?.</p>
<p>Although Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s Taoism is extremely high at the moment, and after experiencing the thorough understanding of life and death, his mentality reincarnates and his practice goes further. However, this power of killing immortals is not possessed by human beings, and can not be resisted by human beings. What&rsquo;s more, they are helpless. They have to sigh and wait for death.</p>
<p>But at this critical moment of life and death, his heart was still, without the slightest fear, as if he was about to go home, with a faint smile on his lips.</p>
<p>However, it seemed that God didn&rsquo;t want him to die like this. When Zhang Xiaofan gave up, another voice sounded in the distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elder martial brother, stop&hellip;&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This voice is young and calm, but in the voice, it gives people a faint feeling of excitement and flying. It seems that the speaker can easily move people&rsquo;s hearts and make people&rsquo;s blood boil.</p>
<p>The power of killing immortals, which could not be stopped by gods and demons, suddenly came to a halt. The immortal daoxuan, who looked as if he had mastered the power of life and death of heaven and earth and looked down upon everything, suddenly dissipated the black air on his face, showing an unbelievable look, staring at the ghost&rsquo;s back in astonishment, and his voice became hoarse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You Younger martial brother wan.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s pressure suddenly dissipated, and then those cracks at his feet closed quietly, as if they had never appeared before. He had no time to be surprised. He turned around and looked back.</p>
<p>A white figure was standing under the stone door where he had just entered the world.</p>
<p>He was a young and handsome young man, with a gentle smile on his face, but in his eyes, it seemed that he always exuded a passion. When the wind blows on the Gobi, his white clothes are floating, which is indescribable and natural. He just stands casually. However, Zhang Xiaofan suddenly feels a sense of respect from his heart. It seems that if he says a word, he will follow him and lead the world. He is also willing to fight the bloody battlefield.</p>
<p>In the sky, the moon is shining.</p>
<p>Once the green cloud double pride, in this illusory general time space, in the confused and lost memory, meet again.</p>
<p>The body of immortal daoxuan began to tremble slowly. The ancient sword of killing immortals was lowered slowly. Step by step, he walked down the altar to the white figure, never looking at Zhang Xiaofan again.</p>
<p>White floating, handsome face as the memory of that warm years, emitting a youthful light.</p>
<p>The light, warm and blazing, once upon a time, was the most precious place in his heart.</p>
<p>In his eyes, in his dry eyes, there were tears flowing slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Younger martial brother Is it really you.</p>
<p>The young man in white stood there, not leaving the stone gate. He said to daoxuan with a smile: &ldquo;Hello, elder martial brother. We haven&rsquo;t seen each other for a long time.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan&rsquo;s body shook for a moment. Although he still held the ancient sword of Zhuxian, his black spirit quickly faded after he saw the figure of wanjianyi. At the same time, Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s deep tired color when he saw him at first returned to his face.</p>
<p>He seems to be ten years old in this short period of time, just like the life in his body, being sucked away by the immortal in his hand.</p>
<p>But daoxuan immortal obviously didn&rsquo;t pay attention to the changes of his body. His whole spirit was put on the mysterious young man in white. Slowly, he stretched out his hand to touch the body in memory: &ldquo;younger martial brother&hellip;&rdquo;.</p>
<p>His voice, half broken, his hand through the body, nothing but nothingness.</p>
<p>Daoxuan was a staggering man. He seemed to be on a shaky footing. After reaching out to help the stone gate, he reluctantly stopped. He gasped in his mouth, but his eyes flashed despair and pain.</p>
<p>As a fleeting shadow, the white figure that had just disappeared for him to reach out and touch appeared quietly in front of him, but still did not leave the scope of the stone gate. The young shadow still said with a smile: &ldquo;elder martial brother, why are you not awake?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Taoist immortal looked up, his eyes were confused and murmured: &ldquo;sober, what is sober?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The young man in white gazed at him and said quietly, &ldquo;elder martial brother, you are so intelligent that you should have a thorough understanding. Let go, let go of the nostalgia for the secular world and the useless pursuit of power. Did we eat these things when we were practicing together.</p>
<p>The body of immortal daoxuan was shaking slowly. At the moment, he saw that he had completely eaten an old man. At the last moment of his life, he was struggling in bewilderment to see the way ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We Cultivation For what Ah? &ldquo;.</p>
<p>The young man in white showed his gentle smile again. The expression on his face was so warm that even Zhang Xiaofan standing beside him trembled. I saw that white clothes did not say anything more, just gently tossed the shame robe, a light wind blowing between the lapels, blowing the fine dust under the feet, leaving nothing to be seen.</p>
<p>He looked at Taoist immortal&rsquo;s old and tired face calmly and said gently, &ldquo;elder martial brother, put it down.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pa!&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The ancient sword of killing immortals contains supreme power, which is enough to destroy the heaven and earth. It fell from the hands of immortal daoxuan and fell like a common sword on the earth.</p>
<p>Daoxuan real man&rsquo;s face, slowly showed a smile, that smile is calm and calm, with the white youth&rsquo;s face smile feel the same.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Silly, it took so long to understand He spoke in a low voice, stepped forward, stretched out his hands, as if to embrace something, but after a moment, his body slowly fell down and fell to the ground.</p>
<p>All life dissipated from the body, but in any case, it could not take away the faint and gentle smile on daoxuan&rsquo;s real face.</p>
<p>The world is silent, for a moment, only the distant wind is left.</p>
<p>Once a powerful figure, at the moment, so quietly went, Zhang Xiaofan stood on the side, watching what happened.</p>
<p>On the contrary, he looked at the body of daoxuan in silence. After a while, he turned around and looked at Zhang Xiaofan.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s heart more or less knows what kind of identity this seemingly illusory figure in white is. He can&rsquo;t help but feel the general reverence in his heart, and says in a low voice, &ldquo;master.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The young man in white is still with a gentle smile, looking at Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s eyes with some appreciation, and said with a smile: &ldquo;Hello, boy, it&rsquo;s really good.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan didn&rsquo;t understand why he praised himself or what the word &ldquo;good&rdquo; in his words meant. He felt a little surprised. However, the young man in white did not seem to intend to explain. With a gentle wave of his hand, he saw the ancient sword of killing immortals lying on the ground suddenly seemed to be dragged by an invisible force and flew up.</p>
<p>The young man in white gazed at the ancient sword, then looked at Zhang Xiaofan and said quietly: &ldquo;boy, the power of killing immortals is the supreme power to capture the mysterious and strange nature of heaven and earth. It can kill immortals and Demons and destroy heaven and earth. It should not exist in the world, but since he is here, he needs a master eventually.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>While speaking, the ancient sword of Zhuxian is like a floating duckweed, but it is sent by the wind and floats to Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was shocked and looked at the young man in white. He didn&rsquo;t know what to say for a moment. After half a sound, he said, &ldquo;master, you&hellip;&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The young man in White said with a smile, &ldquo;why do you think you can come here? In fact, it is the sword that calls you to come. Therefore, you are the one who is predestined. &ldquo;.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan shook his head and said, &ldquo;master, you and daoxuan Both of them are marvelous talents. None of them is more intelligent than his disciples. You can&rsquo;t really master the power of killing immortals. How can you take such a great responsibility.</p>
<p>With a smile, the young man in White said, &ldquo;if you can&rsquo;t bear it, you&rsquo;ll know that the power of killing immortals is not a common thing in the world. It&rsquo;s natural that you can master it.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was stunned and looked at the young man in white and said, &ldquo;what do you mean by that, master?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The young man in White said with a smile: &ldquo;since ancient times, you are the only one who has the chance to run through five volumes of&rdquo; Tianshu &ldquo;with four volumes. If not, there are millions of creatures in the world. Why can only you feel the calling words of the ancient sword of killing immortals.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was more surprised and lost his voice: &ldquo;what, do you mean this ancient sword for killing immortals is&hellip;&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The young man in White said with a smile: &ldquo;yes, the ancient sword of Zhuxian is the fifth book of heaven in the legend!&rdquo; Speaking of this, he suddenly turned pale again, but soon returned to peace. He said faintly: &ldquo;what&rsquo;s more, the key to really master the power of killing immortals is not the level of one&rsquo;s practice, but the most important one is his heart.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was puzzled and said, &ldquo;why is this?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The young man in White said: &ldquo;the power of killing immortals is far beyond the ordinary world. If you control this power, you can easily become invincible. Once you have such a terrible power, you will unconsciously indulge in it. In the end, you will become a servant of the power of killing immortals.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>He sighed and said: &ldquo;at that time, elder martial brother daoxuan and I were both self-confident and supercilious, but in the end, they did not resist the evil spirit. Only those who really experienced hardships, setbacks and failures, and a heart tempered into steel were the true masters of the power of killing immortals!&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The ancient sword of Zhuxian slowly floated to Zhang Xiaofan. In the distance, the figure of the young man in white began to shake and gradually blurred, but his voice still came clearly, &ldquo;boy, master this power well. When you really understand the meaning of that sentence in the book of heaven, you will understand everything&hellip;&rdquo;.</p>
<p>At the next moment, the white shadow disappears. Almost at the same time, Zhang Xiaofan slowly reaches out his hand and grabs the handle of Zhuxian ancient sword.</p>
<p>Five fingers, close!.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boom!&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Like a thunderbolt, it suddenly exploded in my ears, tearing away the whole sky. The lightning was flying in disorder, and the clouds were rolling. On the sky, the moon was shining brightly, and the colorful lights were constantly shining. It gathered into a huge light column and fell from the sky to cover Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s figure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah&hellip;&rdquo;.</p>
<p>With a long roar, the sound went into the clouds. Zhang Xiaofan flew backwards and fell on the altar. Seven colorful pillars lit up at the same time. The light pillars were like dragons. They were vigorous in the air, and seemed to be shouting.</p>
<p>In the depths of Guanghua, Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s figure seems to be a little fuzzy. I can see his movements vaguely. Slowly, he lifts the ancient sword of killing immortals. With the rise of the ancient sword, the clouds and clouds on the sky are spinning more and more rapidly. That colorful Qi sword, which represents the power of killing immortals, appears again, and looks down upon the world and is incomparable!.</p>
<p>Around the huge sword in the sky, under the light of the illusory moon, a row of huge gold typefaces, each of which is a hundred Zhang high, appears slowly in the open and empty world. Each of them is a hundred Zhang high, and it is very spectacular.</p>
<p>Heaven and earth are merciless. They regard all things as cud dogs!.</p>
<p>The wind and cloud are surging, the sky and the earth are whistling. Deep in the light, there is a deep gaze at the sky of heaven and earth!.</p>
<p>Qingyun Mountain, Tongtian peak.</p>
<p>Looking out from the top of Tongtian peak, the sky in the distance is no longer as blue and empty as it used to be. At this moment, a violent blood red light shadow covers the sky, turns into a heavy dark cloud and is pressing towards the Tongtian peak.</p>
<p>There is chaos in Qingyun gate. This sudden invasion of the demon sect is so fierce that no one can predict. In a short period of time, the right path has been greatly damaged. The elites are in the middle of eight out of ten. The most terrible thing is that the elite of the nine out of ten is actually the mysterious and strange evil magic technique of the ghost King Zong of the evil cult. They are all confused and become the thugs of the ghost king Six relatives didn&rsquo;t recognize him. He turned back and slaughtered Taoist friends.</p>
<p>At first, the absolute superiority of the Warcraft cult was reversed suddenly. However, the ghost king didn&rsquo;t think it was normal enough. He even put out more evil methods. He even bewildered all the people who went to Qingyun road and near Qingyun Mountain mountain mountain. He only knew how to kill. The number of people was more than 100000, which was more powerful than that of the beast demon who was known as the catastrophe of heaven and earth Better, better.</p>
<p>The Qingyun gate is just a disciple of Qingyun sect and a remaining friend in the right path. The elite of the great sect of the famous sect is no longer in the air. Even the great masters like Tianyin temple, there are not more than a dozen monks, including abbot Puhong, Pukong monk, Dharma Prime Minister of the younger generation, FA Shan and others. Among the monks, there is a dry old monk, He was silent and stood by the side of master Pu Hong.</p>
<p>Hearing that the monks of Tianyin temple came, there was a stir in Qingyun gate. For many years, Tianyin temple has always been friendly with Qingyun gate. Whenever there is a big disaster, they all fight against the enemy side by side. At present, people welcome out one after another, but after seeing the Tianyin Temple monks, they can&rsquo;t help but be dumbfounded.</p>
<p>In front of everyone in Qingyun gate. In addition to Xiao Yicai, who is in charge of affairs temporarily in changmen, he is Zeng Shuchang, the first Fenghui peak and the first Shuiyue master of xiaozhufeng, the highest generation in Qingyun gate.</p>
<p>When Uncle Zeng looked around, he could see that the monks in Tianyin Temple looked dusty, but most of them were bloodstained. It is obvious that before they came here, they had already gone through one or several bitter battles, which made him think of the numerous monks in Tianyin temple. Actually, only these people have come, isn&rsquo;t it.</p>
<p>Zeng Shuchang took a step forward. Hesitated for a moment, he said, &ldquo;master Pu Hong, you This.</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong was quite calm and gave a salute in reply. He said, &ldquo;this catastrophe has happened again. The world&rsquo;s living beings are on the way. The monks of our temple originally wanted to save the common people. However, their ways are higher than one foot and the demons are ten feet higher. Most of the disciples have already died.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Having said that, he read a sentence of &ldquo;Amitabha Buddha&rdquo; gently. Uncle Zeng was dumb, and then his face showed a deep look of pain. Xiao Yicai tried to calm down. Although his heart slowly sank, he still forced a smile and said, &ldquo;no matter what, it&rsquo;s good for you to come here. Please go first.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Master Puhong and other monks of Tianyin Temple joined hands to answer the ceremony. At that time, they all walked back to the Yuqing hall. Behind them, the bloody red clouds on the distant sky pressed in a few minutes.</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue walked a few steps. Suddenly, if he felt something, he looked back and saw that Lu Xueqi, who was following her, walked to the railing beside the stone steps. She was staring away from the railing and was in a daze. She didn&rsquo;t know what she was thinking. Water moon master just wanted to call her, suddenly look a dark, as if thinking of something, quietly walked in the past, went to Lu Xueqi behind, a soft voice called: &ldquo;Xueqi.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s body moved and woke up with a start. She looked back at master Shuiyue and said in a low voice, &ldquo;yes, master, I&rsquo;ll go in right now.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>After that, she turned and was about to go to the Yuqing hall. However, master Shuiyue&rsquo;s expression flashed over her face, but she held Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s hand and held her.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi, somewhat surprised, turned her head and said, &ldquo;master, what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue sighed softly, looking at no one around, lowered his voice and said in a soft voice, &ldquo;Xueqi, you can go now.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi was stunned and said, &ldquo;master, where do you want my disciples to go?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue turned to the distance and looked at the fierce red clouds rolling down. He said faintly, &ldquo;leave Qingyun Mountain, go to the place you want to go, and be with the people you miss in your heart, and have a good life.&rdquo; She slowly turned to look at Lu Xueqi and said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t come back.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s face turned white for a while, and tears flashed in her eyes. But after a while, she shook her head slowly and said in a low voice: &ldquo;master, I don&rsquo;t go. I want to be with you.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue gave a bitter smile and said, &ldquo;silly boy, Master Shifu has lived for such a long time. Even if you die, it&rsquo;s OK. But you are still so young, and you really care about the people you love. Listen to the master&rsquo;s words and leave Qingyun to be with him.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi clenched her teeth and her lips trembled slightly. It seemed that master Shuiyue&rsquo;s words to her were a temptation that she could not refuse at all. She was haunted and unforgettable. Wasn&rsquo;t it all for that kind of life?.</p>
<p>But, after all, she still slowly, as if it was extremely difficult, but after all, she slowly shook her head, and then, turned and walked toward the Yuqing palace. Master Shuiyue looked at her thin and fragile figure, a long sigh, slowly shook his head, look pathetic.</p>
<p>Standing in the same place for a moment, she sighed and walked towards the Yuqing hall. Halfway there, she stopped again and looked at the railings in the far corner of Yuqing hall. In that quiet place, there was another man and a woman standing together quietly, whispering and not knowing what they were talking about.</p>
<p>The two men, the female, are Wen Min, a disciple of master Shuiyue, and the male is song Daren of dazhufeng. Seeing their looks and tender feelings, they do not have much fear of death. Instead, they seem to cherish the short time.</p>
<p>At least, the expression on their faces, with a faint gentle smile.</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue&rsquo;s heart, as if it was painful again, looked at the two people for a long time, silent, slowly walked into the Yuqing hall.</p>
<p>In the Yuqing hall, all the people had already taken their seats. Master Puhong was highly respected. They pushed him to take the throne. However, master Puhong insisted on resigning. Finally, the throne was left empty, and the people sat on both sides in turn.</p>
<p>Zeng Shuchang coughed and said, &ldquo;master, is it possible that the demon cult has attacked the nearby Tianyin temple?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Master Puhong said: &ldquo;our Buddha is merciful. For the time being, the demons and claws haven&rsquo;t hurt the people near Tianyin temple. The monks in our temple heard that the demons of the evil cult have committed crimes again and killed life again. In order to protect the people in the world, they went to stop it. Unexpectedly, the evil cult&rsquo;s magic method is so powerful that it has harmed many disciples. Alas I have a lot of sin.</p>
<p>All the people in Qingyun gate felt sorry. Xiao Yicai advised: &ldquo;master, don&rsquo;t blame yourself. All your dead senior brothers have died well. You should go to the Western Paradise. At present, it is imperative to deal with the current crisis.</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong sighed and nodded. Then he looked at the people of Qingyun gate and said, &ldquo;the situation is critical. All living beings are in dire straits. If you look at the whole world, only senior brother daoxuan of your sect can turn the crisis around and save all living beings. Please!&rdquo;.</p>
<p>After that, he Shi deeply saluted him. However, when he said this, everyone in Qingyun gate was staring at each other, and they were speechless. They didn&rsquo;t know what to say. Soon, master Pu Hong found out that the situation was not right and said in dismay, &ldquo;how?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai gave a bitter smile and said, &ldquo;master, there is something wrong with us in Qingyun gate. My master has already It&rsquo;s been missing for days. &ldquo;.</p>
<p>The monks of Tianyin temple were shocked. Master Puhong said in astonishment: &ldquo;how could this be so?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai, with a helpless look on his face, said: &ldquo;so far, I don&rsquo;t want to hide it from all the masters. Since my master used the killing immortal sword array to defeat the enemy in those years, his old man has become a little strange. His behavior is quite different from usual. Originally, he is a little eccentric, but his old master has done some After the strange thing, he disappeared, and there was no news. &ldquo;.</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong was speechless and speechless. Immortal daoxuan was practicing magical powers and the world was looking at it. How could he have changed into such a state? It&rsquo;s really incredible. But Xiao Yicai and others obviously did not lie. Seeing that they looked embarrassed, it was not easy to tolerate the strange things in their mouth. But the most important thing is that immortal daoxuan disappeared What should we do now?.</p>
<p>Suddenly, master Pu Hong&rsquo;s face moved and raised his head to the Qingyun gate: &ldquo;that I don&rsquo;t know if the ancient sword for killing immortals is still there. Is there any other wise person in your sect who can urge this Zhuxian sword array.</p>
<p>This time, Xiao Yicai didn&rsquo;t speak. Uncle Zeng often sighed and said, &ldquo;master, you don&rsquo;t know. The ancient sword of killing immortals has always been kept by the real person in charge of Qingyun sect. It has been handed down from generation to generation, and outsiders can&rsquo;t touch it. At present, the ancient sword of Zhuxian is also missing with elder martial brother daoxuan. In addition, it needs too much supernatural power to urge the Zhuxian sword array, which can&rsquo;t be cultivated unless it&rsquo;s unique Over a hundred years Only elder martial brother daoxuan can achieve this level. We are ashamed and powerless. &ldquo;.</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong&rsquo;s last glimmer of hope was dashed. He was stunned for a long time and said in a low voice, &ldquo;if this is really the case, is it not that the defeat has been decided, and that the world is really in danger?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>All the people in Qingyun gate were silent. They all looked dignified and bowed their heads.</p>
<p>In the Yuqing hall, the air was very dignified for a moment. Unexpectedly, at this moment, a cry of despair came from a distance, and then a fierce roar was heard, like thousands of wild animals.</p>
<p>A despairing green cloud disciple stumbled into the Yuqing hall and called in a trembling voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Demons, demons and demons are coming up the mountain&hellip;&rdquo;.</p>
<p>All of them stood up together in an instant, and their faces were full of amazement and disbelief. Slowly, a sense of despair filled the magnificent Yuqing hall.</p>
<p>Is it true that there is no hope that everything will be destroyed?.</p>
<p>Behind the crowd, Lu Xueqi quietly turned around and looked into the distance. There was no fear on her face, but only a touch of gentle missing.</p>
