      <p>In the fiery underground caves, the heat waves rolled, and the red magma under the platform kept tumbling and bursting from time to time.</p>
<pre><code>Zhang Xiaofan only felt that breathing seemed to be gradually becoming more difficult, and it seemed that the air sucked into his lungs was also hot. In this sense, wherever you take a step, you will step out of Mars. The white six-tailed fox in front is still lying there quietly. It seems to be very enjoyable to see.

He stood on the spot, looking at the front, hesitated for a moment, and finally walked forward, at the same time, he subconsciously clenched the burning stick in his hand.

The platform is long and narrow, extending all the way to the depths of the magma lake. As Zhang Xiaofan got closer and closer, the surrounding temperature became more and more hot, almost to the point of being unbearable.

I don’t know if it’s this scorching temperature or some other reason. Zhang Xiaofan’s throat is very dry, but he doesn’t dare to be distracted at all. He fixes his eyes on the fox.

He walked three steps away from it and stopped.

The distance was closer, and the sight was more real. He was suddenly shocked in his heart. This is indeed a beautiful fox, with pure white fur from top to bottom, especially in this place like flame hell, it is also like snow. In general, don't say that there is a stray hair, even if there is no trace of scorching.

However, its eyes are closed, and there is a slight wrinkle between the two eyes, as if there is a trace of pain, hanging between its eyebrows.

Zhang Xiaofan looked at it, but his mind flashed countless thoughts. From Xiaochi Town to the present, all he heard was that there was a &quot;three-tailed demon fox&quot; entrenched in harm. But looking at the fox in front of him, it was obviously different from the three-tailed demon fox just fighting.

He vaguely remembered that when he was a child, he listened to the elder brother Song Daren. The world is so big, there is nothing strange, mountains and rivers are beautiful, and there are many monsters and monsters. According to old legends, foxes are the intelligent species among the beasts, and many of them are cultivated as demon. Among the fox demon family, there is the most aura. There is a special place, that is, the higher the practice, the deeper the road, the more the number of tails.

Looking at the six-tailed fox in front of him, Zhang Xiaofan's heart flickered.

Just at this time. The six-tailed fox in front of him seemed to wake up suddenly from a deep sleep, the tail swayed slightly and his head twitched slightly.

Subsequently, it opened its eyes.

In the black and deep pupils. Reflected in front of him, the figure of the slightly nervous boy.

Zhang Xiaofan was shocked in his heart and took a step back, placing the burning rod across his chest and concentrating on alert. Unexpectedly, the six-tailed white fox just looked at him, but he was still lying in the bluestone nest without any trace of hands.

One person and one fox, just confront each other. There was no sound around, only some sounded as if the magma lake had existed for thousands of years. It seems so far away.

The air is still hot, floating between the human fox.

&quot;Junior Lang.&quot; Low, as if with a trace of tired voice coming from the fox's mouth, breaking the silence here: &quot;What are you doing here?&quot;

From the voice of the fox demon, Zhang Xiaofan once again affirmed that there was an injury on the fox, so he was so weak and weak, but he was so brave, he still dare not carelessly, said in a deep voice: &quot;You devil. Harm The world, I am under the right path, and I will eliminate the harm for the people today.&quot;

The six-tailed white fox looked at him, his eyes flashing. No anger, no sneer, just looked at him so lightly, after a while, it looked away and calmly said: &quot;Good ambition!&quot;

Zhang Xiaofan was startled. Immediately frowned and said: &quot;You come here less, get up quickly, I...&quot;

&quot;Are you going to kill me?&quot; The six-tailed white fox suddenly interrupted him and asked peacefully.

Unexpectedly, Zhang Xiaofan said it directly, but suffocated, but immediately woke up and said, &quot;You demon foxes are a disaster to the world, and they are not harmful. I killed you just for the way of heaven!&quot;

The six-tailed white fox crossed his head, his eyes seemed to be a little ridiculed, and a little bit desolate, and said: &quot;Youth Lang, I think you are only 20 years old?&quot;

Zhang Xiaofan snorted and said, &quot;What about it, I also want to demolish the demon.&quot;

The six-tailed white fox bowed his head slightly, as if suddenly feeling a little bit of emotion, whispering: &quot;Yes! Your human beings are really unique in the cultivation of the Tao. Our fox tribe has been practicing hard for thousands of years, but you have good qualifications, but It took only a few hundred years to beat us, just like the old guy in Shangguan...&quot; At this point, it suddenly stopped, smiled bitterly, shook his head, looked at Zhang Xiaofan, and slowly said: &quot;Youth Lang, you At such a young age, how can we know that our fox tribe is doing harm to the world and harming people?&quot;

Zhang Xiaofan sneered and said, &quot;Your companion of the three-tailed demon fox, harassing the residents of Xiaochi Town day and night, looting cattle and sheep and saying nothing, and killing people. Isn't this a disaster for the world and harming people?&quot;

The six-tailed white fox was silent for a while, and said, &quot;Yes, I heard her talk about this. Indeed, as you said, when she went to Xiaochi Town three days ago, the father and son dared to come out to stop, just that day I was sick Again, she was in a bad mood and killed the two stupid people who did not know what to do.&quot;

Zhang Xiaofan said angrily: &quot;So what else do you have to say?&quot;

The six-tailed white fox said lightly: &quot;You made a mistake, and I am not telling you anything. Even if I changed it that day, I would go there and kill it.&quot;

Zhang Xiaofan was furious, halberd pointed and said angrily: &quot;Then you dare to say what is not a disaster for the world, it is not harmful. The evildoer is killed!&quot; The anger screamed, the fire stick rose blue, and it was about to break through. Out.

The six-tailed white fox didn't mean to move, still lying on his stomach, and said lightly: &quot;What do you mean by the world?&quot;

Zhang Xiaofan was stunned again, his thoughts turned around, and suddenly somehow, looking at the six-tailed white fox in front of him, listening to his low words, somehow remembered that 10,000 people.

Vaguely, as if somewhere in the heart, there was an inexplicable voice calling.

The glow of the burning stick gradually disappeared. But the voice of the white fox still continues: &quot;In your eyes, the so-called world is dominated by your human race? Naturally, everything is arbitrarily obtained for your human race, as long as there is any resistance, it is If it is a disaster in the world, it is not harmful, it means that all evils will not be forgiven, and the sins should die, right?&quot;

Zhang Xiaofan looked at it, silent without words. He didn't know why the three-tailed demon fox and the six-tailed white fox seemed to like to talk to him. But what he didn't understand was. For what, these outlandish sounds have such a big influence on his mind?

&quot;But. Have you ever thought about the feelings of other races? What are the feelings of the beasts killed and eaten by your people? In the final analysis, it's just because your human race is strong, and the beasts can't resist, so you have to do it. Slaughter.&quot; The white fox's voice continued indifferently: &quot;That's it. Our fox demon family is stronger than some of your human beings. What kills some of you? Anyway, in this world, it was originally weak meat and strong food.&quot; It smiled. , Looking at Zhang Xiaofan, said: &quot;What do you say?&quot;

Zhang Xiaofan stared at it, pursed his lips tightly, and said nothing.

&quot;Also, even if it is among your human race, why is it not so? You cultivate the truth and practice the Tao. Nowadays, longevity has not been cultivated, but it is a pleasure to fight with each other. The so-called righteous evil path is actually not only in your mouth. What is said here is that the winner is the king, and the loser is the coup.&quot;

It smiled again, looked at Zhang Xiaofan, and said repeatedly: &quot;What do you say?&quot;

Zhang Xiaofan closed his eyes, raised his head, and took a deep breath. The white fox also didn't speak anymore, it seems that after saying so much. It also felt a little tired.

a long time.

&quot;What do you want me to say?&quot; Zhang Xiaofan said suddenly.

The white fox looked at him and found that he had opened his eyes. The teenager had complex but bright eyes, looking at it.

&quot;Every one of you told me the truth in one way or the other.&quot; Zhang Xiaofan said coldly: &quot;It seems that I am wrong as the right way. You are right to kill people and make chaos. You devil are outsiders, except to confuse people, What else?&quot;

The white fox suddenly frowned, with a flash of light in his eyes, and suddenly said, &quot;Why, have any other people ever said this to you?&quot;

Zhang Xiaofan did not answer. But the black light of the burning stick has gradually lightened up again, reflecting his face, changing. Just listening to his voice said: &quot;Demon, let's do it!&quot;

The blue light is like this, and the gloom comes over the blazing red light everywhere, like the mountains down and empty.

The six-tailed white fox looked at the oppressed blue light. In this hot lava place, there was still a trace of cold, and the whole body suddenly shook involuntarily.

At this moment, Zhang Xiaofan suddenly heard behind him, that is, the channel that he had just fallen from, came the sound of a rushing roar.

The sound was like a roar of a beast, like a thousand horses and horses, the iron hooves were raging, and the momentum was fierce. Zhang Xiaofan was shocked in his heart, but he didn't dare to take the six-tailed white fox in front lightly. He had to withdraw the burning stick immediately and lay it across his chest, concentrating on his right.

In a farther place, the six-tailed white fox also frowned slightly, and looked at the Yongdao.

Before long, Zhang Xiaofan felt that the heat wave coming from that channel became hotter and harder to breathe, almost giving people the feeling that in this lava crypt, everyone would be cooked.

I was suspicious, but I heard that the momentum was getting closer and closer, and the momentum was getting fiercer. After a moment, he only felt his eyes light up, and the dark tunnel suddenly shone with light, and a huge fire dragon burst out from the narrow hole. After exiting the cave, the fire dragon roared loudly and rose into the air, spreading its teeth and dancing claws. The white shadow flashed from above the dragon's head, and a white figure floated down, but it was the tender three-tailed demon fox.

I saw that she fell in front of the six-tailed white fox, somehow on her face, with some anxiety, her original neat clothes, there were actually a few torn and dirty places at this moment, it seems that the fight just outside was just now, she Actually suffered some losses.

Zhang Xiaofan froze for a moment, standing on the spot, without stepping forward, his eyes were attracted by the huge fire dragon still swimming in mid-air. I saw that the fire dragon was hot all over the body, and it was burning, which was the two huge incandescent flames in the dragon eyes.

The fire dragon in this huge underground lava cave seemed to be moistened, and the momentum was more fierce. In the sound of the dragon, the fire dragon rushed down.

Zhang Xiaofan was taken aback, and quickly backed away a few steps, but he saw that the fire dragon just wiped his side. Under the heat wave, the fire dragon roared into the magma lake at his feet, and disappeared in a blink of an eye. Come out and swim happily in this terrifying lake.

Suddenly, I heard the voice of the three-tailed demon fox in front of you: &quot;Brother, are you okay?&quot;

The six-tailed white fox smiled and said lightly: &quot;This little brother under the righteous door hasn't done anything to this dying fox!&quot;

Zhang Xiaofan's face was red, and he frowned, listening to the words of the six-tailed white fox. It seems that it is dying from illness.

The three-tailed demon fox's face was a bit sad, and whispered: &quot;Brother, in addition to the two who came with this boy, two people even came to Burn Incense Valley.&quot;

The body of the six-tailed white fox seemed to shake too. Turned her head to look at her, said: &quot;Is that the old man of Shangguan?&quot;

The three-tailed demon fox shook his head and said, &quot;No, they are two younger generations of disciples, but they have a deep path. I, I am not their opponent...&quot;

The six-tailed white fox was stunned, and sighed slightly, saying, &quot;Ah! You are only three hundred years of Daoxing. Even if there is Xuan Huo Jian, how can you resist these outstanding disciples of the famous school, just stop, just stop.&quot;

The three-tailed demon fox's extremely charming face actually stunned and fell two tears: &quot;But, brother, now there is no way in this &quot;Fire Dragon Cave&quot;. The above is blocked by the four of them, and now only rely on the &quot;big black leech&quot; &quot;Stop trying to block it, but I see their magic weapon is so powerful, I'm afraid I can't attack it if I don't have a fragrance. What should we do?&quot;

The six-tailed white fox looked at her and lifted her front claws hard, as if trying to catch her, but lifted it into the air and fell again. It gasped for a long while and said: &quot;Did you not see it yet? Even if they didn't come, I wouldn't do it.&quot;

Tears of the three-tailed demon fox. It fell on the pure white snow of the white fox.

But the sound of the white fox sounded calmer: &quot;For three hundred years, I have been running east and west. I have lived a dark day all day and night. I am afraid that those who burn incense valleys will come to chase down and endure day and night. &quot;Jiu Han Ning Bing&quot;'s methamphetamine attacked. But today, he still can't escape.&quot;

The three-tailed demon Fox said sadly: &quot;Brother, don't tell me, I'll take you to rush out, we still have Xuan Huo Jian. With your way, you can definitely...&quot;

The white fox slowly shook his head and whispered: &quot;I have been the foundation of Dao Xing for nearly a thousand years. In these three hundred years, I have been damaged bit by bit by the ice poison of Jiuhan Ningbing. Now I am cold and cold The bone marrow is no longer there.&quot;

The three-tailed demon fox trembled, and could no longer speak.

The white fox looked up and seemed to hesitate before saying: &quot;I really can't do it anymore, but you don't have to die, and you have Xuan Huo Jian in your body, wait for them to rush down the Yong Dao, you drive the fire dragon, and thrust back up, they In a shock, you may not be able to stop you. You, you still...&quot;

It suddenly stopped talking. In front of it, the three-tailed demon fox slowly stood up, reached into his arms, and took out a magic weapon with red silk spikes at both ends, which was Xuan Huo Jian.

In this flaming lava crypt, Xuan Huo Jian was also faintly reddish, and the ancient flame totem in the middle of it seemed to be burning at the moment, almost squirting out.

Three-tailed demon fox, the charming white woman in Zhang Xiaofan's eyes, stared at Xuan Huo Jian in his hand at the moment. Suddenly, there was a teardrop dripping quietly on Xuan Huo Jian. After a few moments, it turned into white smoke and curled up.

It turns out that the fox also has tears?

It turns out that the evildoers are also affectionate?

Zhang Xiaofan froze there, motionless.

&quot;Three hundred years, brother.&quot; She whispered lowly and sadly: &quot;It's been three hundred years, since I was a monk, I met you at &quot;Huqi Mountain&quot;, and since then, I have Follow you. Tianya Haijiao, Liuhe is wild, from now on, there is no day, from day to night worry, was chased and killed.

But, I never regretted it...&quot;

Zhang Xiaofan slowly approached a few steps, standing behind them, and suddenly there was an inexplicable confusion in his heart. When he heard the three words of Huqi Mountain, he moved deeply and felt a little familiar, but But I can't remember for a while.

At that moment, the feminine woman's eyes were full of crystal tears: &quot;But today, why, why do you still call me away?&quot;

The white fox lowered his head, and at the same time Zhang Xiaofan noticed its body. I wondered whether it was because of the cold or excitement, and began to tremble slowly.

&quot;Brother!&quot;

The feminine woman suddenly shouted, the voice was so sad, the white fox quickly looked up, and Zhang Xiaofan was startled by her and turned to look.

The old-fashioned Xuan Huo Jian was lightly placed on her chest against her tender and undulating chest, emitting a faint halo.

The white fox trembles all over his body. He no longer knows where he came from, and he squeezed his upper body hard, screaming, &quot;No...&quot;

&quot;boom!&quot;

There was a muffled sound, but it was like hitting Zhang Xiaofan's heart. He stood behind the charming woman and looked at her soft back, revealing the light of Xuan Huo Jian.

One bit, one drop, converged into a hot beam of light, which penetrated her gentle body.

All the sounds in the world around me suddenly became so distant at that moment...

…

All the killing, the attachment in my heart, slowly receded.

In the boy's eyes, only the red blood flowed from the gentle and beautiful body, dripped onto the ground, turned into a bright red flower, and then slowly penetrated into the rock.

The land of blood and red will never fade!

She fell helplessly and fell in front of the white fox. The white fox shouted hoarsely, but Zhang Xiaofan couldn't understand what it was shouting, only to see the white fox screaming, his whole body trembling, struggling to climb forward, to the fragile dying body not far ahead. But it was so weak that after struggling for half a day, it only climbed out half a point.

Zhang Xiaofan suddenly rushed over.

He rushed past, at that moment, he seemed to forget everything.

He carefully picked up the body of the seriously wounded and charming woman and placed it in front of the white fox, then stepped back silently and stood in front of them.

It was also at this time that the sound of roar came again from the Yong Dao in the distance, and then there was a loud noise, and something fell from that Yong Dao, dry and dry, but Zhang Xiaofan clearly recognized that, that It was part of the huge tentacle that once trapped him.

He stared back, staring at the two fox monsters in front of him.

The white fox caught the charming woman, and her whole body was shaking violently. Its once beautiful fur, at this moment, withered almost at a visible speed.

&quot;You...&quot; His hoarse voice seemed to tear his heart every time he said a word.

Rou Mei woman, the demon known as the three-tailed demon fox, her face pale as paper, without any trace of blood, but still unexpectedly gentle like this, as if dying fear, the pain of tearing her chest could not control her at all.

Until now, she still looked at the white fox tenderly.

&quot;Brother, now, you can't tell me to go!&quot;

The white fox can't make a sound.

She raised her hand as if she wanted to touch him, but she fell halfway after reaching halfway. Her blood stained the chest of the white fox.

Even her voice slowed down.

&quot;Brother, I will be with you,...with...&quot;

She closed her eyes and never opened again.

The whole world is quiet. (To be continued.)</code></pre>
