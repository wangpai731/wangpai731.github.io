      <p>White hair and sideburns are growing, and age is like water!</p>
<p>The ghost King took his eyes away from the mirror like water, sighed a little, turned around, smiled and said, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t looked in the mirror for a long time, but I see more white hair today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Standing behind him, the ghost face was expressionless, and said lightly, &ldquo;you have more than one heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the moment, there is a small lake in Huqi mountain. A stone pavilion is built in the middle of the lake. There is only an old wooden bridge connected to the Bank of the lake. Ghost king and ghost Li are standing in the stone pavilion in the middle of the lake at the moment.</p>
<p>The ghost king, with his hands on his back, said: &ldquo;I heard that I went to kongsang mountain this time. Although I took the blood refining hall, the only remaining wild dog Taoist who refused to surrender was protected by you. Can it happen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost Li took a look at the ghost king, but saw his face was peaceful, and he didn&rsquo;t know what he was thinking. Then he nodded slowly, &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost King smiled and turned to look at the green and jade lake. He said lightly: &ldquo;in the past, you led people to attack, but you killed all the time. How can you face this person today, but leave your face?&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a moment&rsquo;s silence, ghost Li said, &ldquo;although the blood refining hall is now in decline, it was the leader&rsquo;s gate valve eight hundred years ago, not a smaller sect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost king stood there, and did not see any reaction, nor did he know whether he was satisfied or not with the explanation. After a while, he suddenly said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s said that the blood bead in your hand is the relic of the old man with black heart. I&rsquo;m afraid that you and the blood refining hall have some passion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost Li slowly raises an eye, looks to the ghost king, the ghost king just turned around, also looked to him.</p>
<p>The eyes of the two of them collided in the middle of the air. The eyes of the ghost King were dark and peaceful.</p>
<p>The ghost king suddenly smiled and said: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s said that there is a strange treasure in the Western dead swamp recently. Do you know? &quot;</p>
<p>Ghost Li nodded and said, &ldquo;yes, I heard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost king said leisurely: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s said that not only the people in the right way are swarming away, but also the experts in the ten thousand poison sect and the joy sect are going to step in. As for the longevity hall, which is near the death swamp, we should not let it go. &quot; He paused and said to the ghost, &ldquo;what do you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, ghost Li didn&rsquo;t speak at once. After a long silence, ghost King seemed to be very patient with him. There was no sign of anxiety.</p>
<p>For a while, GUI Li said slowly, &ldquo;this time we accept the blood refining hall. Besides the four major sects, the last one with more strength has been divided.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ghost king mouth corners float a smile, nod a head way:&rdquo; good</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ghost Li said:&rdquo; in the demon sect, there are always mountains at the top of the mountain. All four sects want to invade each other. In the past, it was forced by the right way and external forces to jointly resist foreign enemies. Now, naturally, it is different from that of the past. At present, the power of the church is gradually scheduled to go further. It&rsquo;s a fierce battle among the four great sects. I just don&rsquo;t know who started it first. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good, good!&rdquo; said the ghost king with a smile! Well said. &quot;</p>
<p>Guili glanced at him and said lightly: &ldquo;in the past ten years, you have not only passed on the two volumes of my book of heaven, but also passed on all the lessons and scheming decisions you have learned in your life. If I can&rsquo;t even see this, I will not let you down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost king looks at the young man in front of him with a smile, just like looking at a perfect precious object made by himself. There is also a faint pride in the joy, only listening to him: &ldquo;that&rsquo;s not the end, I pass on your things, but also rely on your own understanding. You&rsquo;ve been in the country so fast these years. It&rsquo;s a big surprise to me. I thought that with your qualifications, you would have to practice for at least 30 years, but only ten years, you have achieved great success. It&rsquo;s rare and rare! &quot;</p>
<p>So praised by the ghost king. There seemed to be no smile on his face, as if it was not something to be happy with for him.</p>
<p>However, the ghost king doesn&rsquo;t care. Over the years, the man in front of him has changed from Zhang Xiaofan to today&rsquo;s ghost. His temperament has changed dramatically in the past. Apart from his appearance, there is almost no other shadow of that year. He paused for a moment and said: &ldquo;in your opinion, since the four great sects in our holy religion can&rsquo;t avoid a fight, you think it&rsquo;s good for us to start first! Or just wait? &quot;</p>
<p>This time, however, he didn&rsquo;t hesitate at all and immediately said, &ldquo;strike first!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost King stared at him and said, &ldquo;OK! Which faction do you think you should deal with first? &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ghost Li way:&rdquo; longevity hall! &quot;</p>
<p>The ghost King frowned, but his eyes were already appreciative. He said, &ldquo;why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ghost Li said:&rdquo; now the power of the ghost King sect and the ten thousand poisons sect is the strongest, and the joy sect and the longevity hall are a little less. The joy sect has always kept a low profile, but the leader of the longevity hall, yuyangzi, is arrogant despite his high Taoism. He has always regarded himself as the host of the battle of Zhengmo in Qingyun Mountain and thought that he was the only one in the demon sect.</p>
<p>So stupid, who else would not choose him? &quot;</p>
<p>The ghost King smiled and said, &ldquo;yes, that&rsquo;s right. Then if you come to preside over it, how should it proceed? &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a good opportunity,&rdquo; said the ghost. There is a strange treasure in the dead swamp. Yuyangzi will surely see it as something in the bag and never allow others to touch it. However, the righteous people swarmed in. We can wait for the eternal life hall to be conflicted with the righteous. Then, when we are both defeated, we can secretly join the ten thousand poisons sect and the Hehuan sect to start together. They will not refuse such things as falling into the ground. Such a battle will succeed! &quot;</p>
<p>The ghost king looked at him and did not speak.</p>
<p>The ghost Li slowly looks up, looks to the ghost king, light way: &ldquo;how?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost King seemed to see that he was a little distracted. After a moment, he woke up and slowly took his eyes back. He sighed in his heart and said lightly, &ldquo;no, what you said is almost the same as what I thought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost and the fierce don&rsquo;t talk.</p>
<p>The ghost King smiled blankly and said, &ldquo;take another two days off and go to the death swamp!&rdquo; As he said, he took a sealed envelope from his arms, handed it to Gui Li, and said, &ldquo;I have clearly written the specific arrangements in this letter. After arriving at the Everglades, all the characters of the ghost King clan are at your disposal. &quot;</p>
<p>The ghost Li slowly took over this letter, received in the bosom, silent for a moment, nodded to the ghost king, then turned to leave. But just after he walked a few steps, he suddenly heard the ghost King saying: &ldquo;there is another thing&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost stopped.</p>
<p>The voice of the ghost king came from afar and said, &ldquo;between you and me, what do you call our holy religion, or one devil religion at a time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ghost Li was silent for a long time and said coldly: &ldquo;I have been in the school for ten years, and I have been fighting for blood all day here. There are always intrigues and intrigues. How can I match the last holy word?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost King laughed and said, &ldquo;Oh! What about the way you came from? &quot;</p>
<p>His body seemed to shake a little. After a while, I only heard him say: &ldquo;the people in the right way do no worse than the people in the demon sect!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost king looked at him with interest and said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s not it. That&rsquo;s not true. What do you think is &ldquo;right&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ghost Li did not answer, silent for a long time, looked up at the sky.</p>
<p>blue sky. white clouds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know!&rdquo; He spoke to himself in a low voice.</p>
<p>After the lonely figure gradually disappeared, the smile on the ghost King&rsquo;s face also disappeared.</p>
<p>His deep eyes, as if flashing a mysterious light, shining constantly, do not know what is in mind?</p>
<p>At this time, a voice came from the other side and said, &ldquo;master, I&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost King interrupted him and said, &ldquo;green dragon. Come on up! &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Qinglong came over from the wooden bridge, looked at the distance along the ghost King&rsquo;s eyes, and said, &ldquo;was the vice patriarch here just now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost King nodded and said, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Qinglong said: &ldquo;the old monster of the ten thousand poisons sect sent someone to come over secretly to ask when the patriarch would send people to enter the death swamp, and everyone would do great things together?&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a sneer, the ghost king said, &ldquo;you reply to them. Three days later, the ghost King sect joined the ten thousand poison sect and the Hehuan sect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Qinglong nodded and said, &ldquo;OK.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost King pondered. Suddenly thought of what turn head to green dragon way: &ldquo;green dragon, how do you see the ghost?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Qinglong is stunned. He looks up at the ghost king, only to see the peace between his eyebrows. But his eyes were so deep that he could not see the bottom. He forgot to answer for a moment.</p>
<p>The ghost King smiled and said, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Green Dragon wakes up, then ponders, but looks a little hesitant. The king of ghosts is in the eye. Smile: &ldquo;Qinglong, you and I have been together for many years, but it&rsquo;s OK to say something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Qinglong shook his head and smiled bitterly, then said: &ldquo;say so! When I was his age, I was not as good as him in Taoism and the city was not as deep as him&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>Speaking of this, he suddenly stopped, the ghost King frowned and said, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter? What else? Say it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Green Dragon hesitated for a moment, looked to the ghost king, said: &ldquo;the means is not as cruel as him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost king looked at him, but didn&rsquo;t say anything. He slowly turned around and looked at the mirror like lake. Behind him, Qinglong slowly said: &ldquo;in recent years, especially in the last two years, the fierce means of action are more and more fierce and fierce, and they are easy to kill people, and they are even more ruthless in the power struggle. And among the younger generation of the ghost King clan, the more outstanding talents, such as the killing monk and Yan Hui, are all gathered under his door. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ghost King light way:&rdquo; do you think this is not good</p>
<p>Qinglong slowly shook his head and said: &ldquo;no, it was just that he How could it have changed to be like this now? &quot;</p>
<p>The ghost king was silent for a while, and suddenly said: &ldquo;in fact, I also saw the eye at the beginning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Qinglong was surprised and said, &ldquo;what do you say, Lord?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I passed on the second volume of his book of heaven, I thought it would take at least 30 years for him to be successful with his qualifications. But in the past ten years, especially the last five years, the cultivation of the spirit has made rapid progress, which can be said to be thousands of miles in a day. I&rsquo;m afraid that he is in the heart, even I haven&rsquo;t seen it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he said that, he always turned his back to Qinglong&rsquo;s eyes, as if there was a cold light that was not known, but his tone did not change: &ldquo;he is persistent and persevering, and it is very beneficial to practice, but I still doubt that there are other reasons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Green Dragon frowns: &ldquo;does he have any secret?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost King shook his head and said, &ldquo;you should know that he is pregnant with the true dharma of Qingyun sect and the great Brahma of Tianyin temple, right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Qinglong nodded, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost King slowly said: &ldquo;as I secretly observed, he not only has achieved great success in our holy scriptures, but also has made great progress in the Taiji Xuanqing road of Qingyun gate and the Dafan Prajna Dharma of Buddhism. Do these three truths have the miraculous effect of complementing each other secretly? &quot;</p>
<p>He turned around and smiled at the green dragon, saying, &ldquo;with his practice at this time and the strange magic weapon in his hand,&rdquo; devour the soul &ldquo;, even if you have the heaven and earth light ring ring, you may only win 50%.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Qinglong smiled and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m old, but I can&rsquo;t compare with young people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost king suddenly laughed, clapped his hand on his shoulder, and said, &ldquo;where is this?&rdquo; He smiled. Leisurely tunnel: &ldquo;I saw that this young man must not be a thing in the pool, but now his achievements are more than I expected. If the prince of ghosts had this person to take over, the future would be limitless. Just&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>The ghost King stands with his hand in his hand, but suddenly he stops talking. Go to the side of the pavilion and look out.</p>
<p>Qinglong stood quietly beside him and looked at the ghost king. On the body that controlled the heavy power, he suddenly had a faint point. Silently convey the unspoken words.</p>
<p>Biyao</p>
<p>Three days later, Guili left huqishan and left for the southwest. At the same time, he was accompanied by monkey Xiaohui. In addition, the wild dog Taoist also followed him. At first, the wild dog Taoist didn&rsquo;t want to go to the dangerous place of the death swamp, but the ghost said lightly: &ldquo;after I leave, I guarantee that this place is a hundred times more dangerous than that swamp. Do you believe it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as this remark came out, the wild dog Taoist turned white.</p>
<p>His mouth is still very hard, but his feet have come out.</p>
<p>The vast land of Shenzhou is vast, among which the Central Plains is the richest. But outside the Central Plains, the north is the extreme cold ice field of ice and snow, with few people; the East is the boundless sea; as for the south, there are 100000 mountains outside the Central Plains, standing on the border, endless, where the barren mountains and bad water. There are countless miasma and poisons. In the legend, there are more strange and strange savages. They are ferocious.</p>
<p>And to the west of the vast land of Shenzhou. There are two bad places. In the northwest direction, there is an endless desolate Gobi, which is called &ldquo;the wild land&rdquo; by the world. It has no rain for hundreds of years, the climate is extremely dry, and occasionally there are some oases. However, most of them are occupied by fierce animals and beasts. As soon as ordinary people enter, they will die. In the rumor, there is a huge temple in the wild, which is the birthplace of the demon cult.</p>
<p>As for the southwest, it is the great death swamp that people talk about. The climate here is quite different from that in the wild northwest. It rains seven or eight days out of ten days in a year. There are many strange plants growing luxuriantly. This cold and humid place has always been the place where the poisonous animals and insects live. The special poisonous biogas here rises from the rotten soil in the swamp every rainy day. If people inhale it, if there is no proper antidote, they will die within half a minute. In addition, the rotten animal bodies, trees, flowers and plants soaked in rain for thousands of years have made this place a dangerous place. If you make a mistake, you will be sucked into the bottomless swamp, never see the sun, and die miserably.</p>
<p>In such a dangerous place, no one will come. But not long ago, there were rumors in the world. In the Western death swamp, there was a huge golden light rising up and rushing to the sky. It was in the middle of the night that the sky was as bright as the day. Three days later, the golden light gradually disappeared. From then on, it seems that there is always a huge whistling sound in the death swamp, which makes people living on the edge of the death swamp scared.</p>
<p>Once the news spread, it made a sensation all over the world. In the eyes of the people who practice Taoism, the spirit and artifact always have their own spirituality. Such huge golden light is naturally the omen of the birth of rare and precious treasures, which calls on people who are destined to go. From the perspective of the golden light column, the magic of this strange treasure is really extraordinary. For a while, the world was shaking, and many good and evil experts gathered.</p>
<p>On the surface, there is an unknown undercurrent, turbulent flow.</p>
<p>In the East, half a day away from the death swamp, there is a desolate and withered little village called &ldquo;Dawang village&rdquo;, because the villagers in the village believe in a mysterious God called &ldquo;Dawang&rdquo;. However, the spirit has never been effective. It does not protect the villagers here from rising to the top and making money, nor does it protect them from food and clothing.</p>
<p>In fact, if you think about it, living in such a death swamp, sometimes you don&rsquo;t know where to suddenly run out of a monster, or run out of a poisonous insect. It&rsquo;s a small thing to kill livestock. There are not a few people who die on it every year. Now people with a little ability have already left this ghost place and gone to the Central Plains. Most of the people who stay here are not angry.</p>
<p>But in these days, king village is suddenly bustling up, the people who come and go are high people. Although Dawang village is not the only entrance to the death marsh, it is the nearest place where some people live. Before entering the death marsh, most people will come here to buy some dry food and clear water. In a few days, the villagers in Dawang village have made a little money and a little more gas.</p>
<p>At the same time, because this is the closest place to the death swamp, there is a strange howling about the golden light in the death swamp. It is also the villagers here who first discovered it and spread it. Therefore, many people came here to inquire about the news.</p>
<p>Only after there are too many people, there are both good and evil in nature. A few days later, in Dawang village, I don&rsquo;t know how many fights have taken place. Some unlucky people haven&rsquo;t entered the death swamp. It&rsquo;s a mistake to have died here for no reason.</p>
<p>Talk less. On this day, GUI Li and wild dog also came to the king village. Standing at the entrance of the village, they saw the people coming and going in the village, but they were very busy, which turned into a dead scene.</p>
<p>When he came to the village, the wild dog looked around and frowned and muttered something.</p>
<p>Monkey Xiaohui is excited to see so many people for the first time these days.</p>
<p>Lying on his shoulder, he squeaked. He patted the ash, looked at the wild dog and said, &ldquo;what are you doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wild dog Taoist said angrily: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking for an inn. I haven&rsquo;t found a place to have a rest after walking so long? It&rsquo;s such a crappy place. It&rsquo;s hard to find an inn! &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ghost Li light way:&rdquo; how, do you think there is an inn here</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; said the wild dog, startled</p>
<p>GUI Li turned to look at the passers-by coming and going in the street. Most of them were well-dressed, obviously not the hard-working people in Dawang village. &ldquo;Have you been here before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wild dog poohed and said, &ldquo;who has enough food to support to come to this ghost place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ghost Li looked at him and said: &ldquo;yes, there is no outsider here. The local villagers are poor again. What&rsquo;s the use of the inn? &quot;</p>
<p>The wild dog was dumb, and his face was a little bitter.</p>
<p>At this time, I suddenly heard a cry from the street ahead. Some people said: &ldquo;predicting the future of 50 years can break the fortune of 300 years. Iron mouth God phase, pen judge Yin and Yang, want to know later days, and to see a phase! &quot;</p>
<p>Ghost Li and wild dog are stunned for a while, look to that voice place together. On the side of the street, there is a shabby wooden table with a bamboo pole beside it. On it is a canvas with the words &ldquo;immortal points the way&rdquo;. At the side of the bamboo pole, an old man with extraordinary bearing shouted. The voice he had just uttered was that of him. Beside him, there was a sleepy young woman with a pretty face. Now she was lying on the edge of the table with a helpless expression.</p>
<p>Needless to say, these two people are Monday Xian and Xiaohuan. Zhou Yixian wanders around the world with Xiaohuan. He is not good at it, but he likes to go to a busy place. Hearing the rumors of the dead swamp some time ago, he immediately ignored Xiaohuan&rsquo;s objection and led her to the king&rsquo;s village.</p>
<p>At the moment, in the words of Monday immortal, the money is exhausted. At the end of the hero&rsquo;s life, he has to look at his face in the street. However, he yells, but gradually changes his appearance in the back: &quot; Dear guests, this immortal has the true biography of his ancestor. He can control the world&rsquo;s poison. In this dead marsh, the marsh gas is extremely poisonous. As long as you match the sachet I sell, it will be invincible and King Kong will not be damaged&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan sighed in a low voice and sat here for several hours. Grandpa shouted vigorously, but actually he didn&rsquo;t sell a sachet.</p>
<p>The local people believe it but can&rsquo;t afford it. However, the outsiders are all people in the cultivation way. They are all well-informed. The words &ldquo;liar&rdquo; are written in their eyes. It&rsquo;s also a good thing that you righteous great Xia are busy with looting, and don&rsquo;t care about this person. Otherwise, if one of the ordinary senior disciples suddenly boils with blood, he will kill the people for fear that he won&rsquo;t be able to eat.</p>
<p>Looking at Monday, Xian was still shouting energetically. Xiaohuan was a little impatient. She stood up and was about to stop Grandpa. Suddenly, there was a flower in front of her, but there was a man standing in front of the wooden table. He was a young man, dressed in a light blue shirt, with a beautiful face, but his face looked pale somehow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss, I want to see you.&rdquo; The young man has a faint smile on the corner of his mouth, which is peaceful.</p>
<p>Xiaohuan frowned and looked at him. At that time, on Monday, Xianxian also found out the situation here. She hurriedly came back with a smile on her face and said, &ldquo;what do you want to see, my guest, wealth or marriage? What do you think of it, face, palm or character measurement? &quot;</p>
<p>The young man pondered and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to enter the dead marsh, too. Please help me to see how it&rsquo;s going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No problem, no problem. Come on, please take a seat, my guest. Well, let&rsquo;s first say that we are the founder&rsquo;s true biography. There is no equal in the traditional Chinese script, so we need to pay ten Liang silver at a time&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So expensive?&rdquo; the young man said</p>
<p>On Monday, the fairy smiled.</p>
<p>The young man then turned his eyes and looked at Xiaohuan. He smiled and said, &ldquo;OK! Twelve is twelve. Come on! You can help me with a word first. &quot;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan glanced at him, took a piece of white paper from the side, handed over the thin pen, and said: &ldquo;please write a word first&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the young man took over the pen and said with a smile, &ldquo;no, I&rsquo;ll write down my name, but you&rsquo;ll help me test it. How is my name going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Say, on this white paper, write down three words, pass to small ring.</p>
<p>Small ring Zheng for a while, took over, looked at the white paper, the ear heard the young man smile: &ldquo;my name is Qin Wuyan!&rdquo; (to be continued. )</p>
