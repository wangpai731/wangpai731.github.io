      <p>&ldquo;It was more than ten years ago, but in my mind, it seems to be the same as what happened yesterday. It&rsquo;s so clear and clear that I haven&rsquo;t forgotten it at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong&rsquo;s voice floated quietly and slowly in the room and began to tell the past.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember very clearly that it was a cloudy day, gloomy. That day, from the beginning of the morning, I felt a little uneasy, but I couldn&rsquo;t tell what was wrong. I couldn&rsquo;t help but be distracted by my usual homework. This kind of situation is very rare. I don&rsquo;t know what it is for, so I was not in a good mood at that time. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it. It&rsquo;s only in the evening that I feel better when I listen to the drum and see that it&rsquo;s getting dark. At that time, I just felt that my practice was not enough and I was distracted for a moment. Suddenly, I heard a shrill cry from the gate of Tianyin temple. &quot;</p>
<p>Speaking of this, master Pu Hong turned his head and looked at his views.</p>
<p>FA Xiang nodded his head and said, &ldquo;yes, it was the disciple who was patrolling the mountain gate at that time. All of a sudden, he saw a man fainting on the ground not far from the gate of the temple. The disciple went over to check it and didn&rsquo;t want to It&rsquo;s uncle Puzhi. &quot;</p>
<p>He sighed and said, &ldquo;at that time, martial uncle Puzhi was in a state of unconsciousness and his face was extremely haggard. However, he had a strange red face on his cheek. It was not until later that I realized that it was because martial uncle Puzhi took the strange medicine &ldquo;three days must die pill&rdquo; in order to prolong his life temporarily</p>
<p>When GUI Li heard this, he was stunned for a moment. The name of the pill was really unheard of. He could not help asking, &ldquo;what is the pill that must die in three days?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pu Hong said: &ldquo;this kind of strange medicine is not used in the right way. It is said that it was made by a strange person named&rdquo; ghost doctor &ldquo;in the evil cult in the past. It is said that as long as you take this pill, even if you have a serious and dying injury, this medicine can also stimulate your own potential and let you live for three more days. During these three days, you can barely maintain the physical strength of normal people. Just once three days later. However, this medicine has become the most poisonous thing in the world. It is a person who is in good health. The Tao is good and the cultivation is perfect. It can&rsquo;t resist the strange properties of this strange medicine. There is no doubt that he will die. That&rsquo;s why they got this weird name. &quot;</p>
<p>He was silent.</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong then said, &ldquo;of course, we didn&rsquo;t know so much at that time, but I was shocked when I received the urgent report from FA xiangtu&rsquo;er.</p>
<p>Younger martial brother Puzhi is gifted, intelligent, and has profound Taoism. He has always been an outstanding figure in Tianyin temple. I didn&rsquo;t expect to be like this. At that time, I immediately asked someone to carry him in and treat him in the Zen room. However, he was still unconscious, but his breath was scattered. He was not only poisoned, but also severely injured by the high-level figures. He had reached the point of exhaustion of oil and light&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong said that although it has been more than ten years since the incident, he still has a gloomy and miserable look on his face. It is obvious that this period of time has passed. It was a big blow to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That night, I tried my best to cure Puzhi junior brother, but I could not sober him up by using all the miraculous drugs and using Zhenyuan. Seeing that his breath was getting weaker and weaker, I was really distressed. Is it that I, the younger martial brother, died in such a vague way? &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no surprise that he died a few days ago, but he was forced to support himself back to Tianyin temple. Of course, before we die, we must be told what we have to say or what is important. &quot;</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong said this. A long sigh, silence down, as if in his mind, and then the days.</p>
<p>After a while, FA Xiang coughed in a low voice and said in a soft voice, &ldquo;master. In those years, I was always with you and uncle Puzhi. It&rsquo;s better for me to narrate the next thing. &quot;</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong nodded in silence and stopped speaking.</p>
<p>The Dharma minister coughed and went on: &ldquo;in those days, I was always with master, watching master and uncle Pufang trying to cure uncle Puzhi, but they were all ineffective, and I was very anxious. Uncle Puzhi used to treat me very well. He only hated me for being shallow and could not do anything for him. However, at a time when my master and I were helpless, uncle Puzhi woke up on his own in the middle of the night. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah&hellip;&rdquo; GUI Li raised his eyebrows and made a low cry in his mouth. Then he quickly controlled himself and became indifferent again.</p>
<p>FA Xiang looked at him and continued: &ldquo;I was on duty to guard martial uncle Puzhi at that time. I was so surprised and overjoyed that I immediately called master and martial uncle Pufang here. Although it has been more than ten years, I still remember that uncle Puzhi&rsquo;s face was dead and decadent that night, but on his cheek, it was as red as blood. It was really terrible.</p>
<p>&quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master and we were very happy to see Uncle Puzhi suddenly getting better. Although he looked strange, he couldn&rsquo;t care so much for a while. At that time, the master and his old man were trying to ask Uncle Puzhi what had happened and how could he be so hurt? Unexpectedly But when Uncle Puzhi saw the master, he and he</p>
<p>FA xiangdun for a moment, but he wanted to calm down.</p>
<p>At this time, the room was silent. The master Pu Hong closed his eyes and recited the Buddha&rsquo;s name gently in his mouth. The beads in his hands turned slightly, and the ghost listened attentively.</p>
<p>FA Xiang didn&rsquo;t know why. His face was a little ugly, but finally he went on talking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle Puzhi has been quiet since he was sober. However, when Shifu came to see him, he suddenly felt as if he had been stimulated by something. The whole person trembled, and he sat up from the bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that time, uncle Yinzhi and my master both held out a withered hand. Master, he quickly walked over and took uncle Puzhi&rsquo;s hand. Just as he was about to ask questions, he went so far as to&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>There was a flicker of hesitation on FA Xiang&rsquo;s face, and he took a look at master Puhong. Master Puhong&rsquo;s face remained unchanged, and his eyes were closed like that.</p>
<p>FA Xiangwei pondered and then said, &ldquo;once master Puzhi holds the master&rsquo;s hand, suddenly, he seems to be completely collapsed. He is like a child, leaning against the master and crying loudly&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; The ghost Li hears here, unexpectedly is momentarily forgetful, astonished stands up. Focus on dharma.</p>
<p>In his mind, no matter what he had done, the Puzhi monk left an impression on him, where could he be such a man?</p>
<p>FA Xiang sighed. He said: &ldquo;at that time, the three of us were shocked and at a loss. We didn&rsquo;t know what happened to Uncle Puzhi and how he was so abnormal. However, looking at the appearance of martial uncle Puzhi, he had a look of regret and sorrow. We don&rsquo;t know what to do. At that time, I only remember that senior uncle Puzhi cried bitterly and said to his father: &ldquo;elder martial brother, elder martial brother, elder martial brother, you should die. You have done a terrible crime. Even if you die, you can&rsquo;t pay for it in case you die!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The corners of his eyes twitched violently on his fierce face, but he didn&rsquo;t say any words.</p>
<p>The Dharma minister&rsquo;s voice was low, and he said slowly, &ldquo;at that time, the feeling of shock in my heart was really beyond the limit.</p>
<p>And looking at the appearance of master and uncle, it is obviously the same idea. It&rsquo;s just that at that time, uncle Puzhi was crazy and almost crazy. We had no choice but to persuade him to have a good rest and wait until he gets better. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Uncle Puzhi refused, saying that he had already taken the pill of death for three days in order to come back to Tianyin temple and see everyone else. Within a day and night, he must die. Before he died, he had something very important to tell his master and uncle, and entrusted him with great things. If you don&rsquo;t listen to what he says. If he died, he would not be at ease. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we heard this, we were all surprised and anxious. However, in front of Uncle Puzhi, we could not help but let him speak. I thought uncle Puzhi was seriously injured. I&rsquo;m afraid he&rsquo;s out of his mind. But when he said this, he actually told such an evil thing, which is against the Buddha&rsquo;s heart and human relations and has boundless sins. &quot;</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong sighed and said, &ldquo;Amitabha!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After hearing this, FA Xiang also saluted the Buddha. Then he looked at the ghost and looked at his iron blue face. Then he said, &ldquo;Uncle Puzhi held the master&rsquo;s hand tightly. As he talked, he was full of tears. We listened to it, but the more we heard it, the more we heard it, the more we heard it, the more we were frightened. Uncle Puzhi said: in order to realize his hope of the integration of Buddhism and Taoism, he went to Qingyun Mountain a few days ago to pay a visit to the real Taoist priest of Qingyun gate to express his views. Unfortunately, he was rejected by the Taoist priest. Disappointed, he wandered down the mountain and came to a small village at the foot of Qingyun Mountain. The name of the small village was &ldquo;Caomiao village&rdquo;&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pa!&rdquo; There was a dull sound, almost at the same time as the word &ldquo;Caomiao village&rdquo;. However, he held the table fiercely. Under the agitation of his mind, he forcibly twisted off a corner of the table, squeezed it into powder, and sprinkled it from his palm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fortunately, one of the youngsters in the temple, who was just about to let go of the temple, sighed that one of the young masters had no intention of playing in the temple He saved one of them. &quot;</p>
<p>The expression on the ghostly face changed again. The fist was tightly held. In a pair of eyes, it was obvious that the color of pain appeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle Puzhi didn&rsquo;t care about this incident, but the weather was bleak at that time. It seemed that there was going to be wind and rain. So he planned to rest in the ruined temple for a night before leaving. But on that night, something happened&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>The fierce head, deeply buried, no longer let other people, see his face.</p>
<p>Memories like a knife, like a deep cut in his heart, blood such as a spring, can not be stopped!</p>
<p>The voice of the Dharma minister slowly echoed, &ldquo;it was the night that martial uncle Puzhi woke up from his meditation and found that a demon in black had sneaked into the Caomiao village, intending to take away a young man with excellent aptitude. Uncle Puzhi could not sit back and ignore him, so he rescued the young man. However, things were strange. He never thought that the black demon was vicious and cunning. He used this young man as a cover. His purpose was to save him. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The evil man in black concealed the world&rsquo;s poisonous&rdquo; seven tailed centipede &ldquo;on the young man, injuring martial uncle Puzhi with one stroke of poison, and then, taking advantage of the chaos of his mind, he severely damaged him with the evil cult method. It was at that time that martial uncle Puzhi realized that the evil ways of the black demon were for the &ldquo;blood sucking bead&rdquo; sealed on his body</p>
<p>His shoulder moved, but he didn&rsquo;t raise his head. Between his sleeves, there was a familiar cold breath on the blood bead</p>
<p>Thousands of tastes, thousands of love and hatred, when you rush into my heart, how do you feel?</p>
<p>He was silent and speechless. It&rsquo;s just that the whole body is tight, and I can&rsquo;t help but shiver</p>
<p>&ldquo;Although the evil man&rsquo;s methods are insidious and vicious, martial uncle Puzhi is a very profound Taoist. Although he was seriously injured, he still used the great magic power of Buddhism to fight with the demon. Although he was seriously injured and dying, he still managed to scare the demon away temporarily. It&rsquo;s just in the process. However, uncle Puzhi was surprised to find that the man knew the real Dharma and magic of the Qingyun sect, which was obviously closely related to Qingyun gate. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When Uncle Puzhi was fighting with the demon, I didn&rsquo;t know why. The boy who had saved his life in the daytime also came quietly to the ruined temple. After several fierce fights, the child was affected and fainted. After fighting, martial uncle Puzhi frightens the demon in black away. However, he had run out of oil and the lamp was dry. He was seriously injured and dying. He had to swallow a &ldquo;three-day death pill&rdquo; accidentally obtained in the past year.</p>
<p>&quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old man knew that he must die, and his mind was in a state of confusion, and he could not deal with affairs peacefully. On the other hand, he was worried that the demon would turn back and kill people in the future. Although he was not afraid, many villagers in Caomiao village were afraid that they would not be slaughtered by the vicious demons. Is it not that he committed a heinous crime. He wanted to ask Qingyun Mountain for help. However, the demon clearly had a deep relationship with Qingyun Mountain. If one of them died, he would have lost many lives. &quot;</p>
<p>The French face is bleak. It seems that he was also grieved for the desperate situation in which Puzhi was at that time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle Puzhi traveled around the world many years ago, and unwittingly took in the world&rsquo;s most ferocious foreign body&rdquo; blood sucking beads &ldquo;in the Western swamp. With the benevolent heart of God, he suppressed the evil object with the magic power of Buddhism and carried it with him day and night. In order not to harm the world. However, the ferocity of the blood sucking beads was born. Although the Dharma protects the body, it still stealthily erodes the mind of martial uncle Puzhi. It&rsquo;s just that there is no Dharma</p>
<p>In his whole life, he had to be in a state of hopeless enlightenment It&rsquo;s so fantastic that he thinks of another way to realize his dream. &quot;</p>
<p>Fierce breathing, slowly rapid up.</p>
<p>The Dharma minister pauses for a moment and says slowly: &ldquo;Uncle Puzhi wants to teach a young man the supreme Dharma Prajna in Tianyin temple in private, and then ask the young man to find a way to worship Qingyun. In this way, he can realize his lifelong ambition. At that time, he was deeply worried about the Enlightenment of Buddhism and Taoism. When he thought about it, he seemed to grasp the straw of life-saving and would not give up any more. Then, after weighing the matter, he chose the young man who was saved by him, passed on the real Dharma formula of his great Brahma Prajna, and at the same time, he told him not to let anyone out of the secret, and put all his life&rsquo;s wishes on the young man. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, hey Hey, hey, hey, hey&hellip; &quot; The extremely repressed laughter flowed out of his drooping face, with some desolation, some bitterness, and some choking.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know whether he is laughing at Puzhi, resenting unceasingly, or resenting heaven and sighing his fate?</p>
<p>After he laughed at him, there was a trace of gloom on his face, and then he said: &ldquo;after everything was arranged properly, martial uncle Puzhi put the boy to sleep again. At the moment, because of the effect of the three-day death pill, his physical strength has gradually recovered. He originally planned to leave here and return to Tianyin temple in three days to explain the future. However, at this time, he suddenly remembered that the Qingyun gate was very strict in recruiting apprentices, and that the boy he chose for the sake of keeping secret was not the kind of genius and good quality that happened once in a thousand years. When he thought about it carefully, Qingyun gate might not be able to bring this young man into the family. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seeing that his greatest wish in his life will fail again, and he is not far away from death, martial uncle Puzhi&rsquo;s mind is in great disorder. After his serious injury, his Buddhist practice has been greatly damaged, which is far worse than usual. At this moment, his anger, which was eroded by blood beads, broke out and finally committed an irreparable sin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When his mind was in turmoil, he was attacked by that anger. In his confusion, he only knew how to accomplish his wish. In his random thinking, he thought that as long as the boy became an orphan and there was a great accident, because at the foot of Qingyun Mountain, Qingyun gate would not sit idly by&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>Pu Hong&rsquo;s face suddenly showed a sad look. The speed of the beads in his hands increased sharply, and the Buddha&rsquo;s name was chanted in his mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So&hellip;&rdquo; At this moment, the voice of the Dharma minister trembled. &ldquo;Uncle Puzhi even thought about how to make this child an orphan, so that he could be worshipped by Qingyun. At that time, his mind had completely lost his nature, and he was controlled by the force of blood sucking demon. Finally, he slowly walked into the Caomiao village and began to He began to kill people. After seeing the first blood, he was completely out of control. He was so fierce that he slaughtered more than 200 people in Caomiao village and committed this heinous crime! &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough. Stop talking about it!&rdquo; All of a sudden, he called out in a loud voice and stood up fiercely. On his face, his face was full of tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more Say It&rsquo;s time to&hellip; &quot; His voice was hoarse and choked.</p>
<p>FA Xiang was silent and lowered his head slowly.</p>
<p>On the Zen bed, master Pu Hong opened his eyes and slowly got out of bed. He reached out to Gui Li and gently comforted GUI Li&rsquo;s shoulder. He said in a low voice, &ldquo;son, if you want to cry and scold, just cry and scold! But after all, you&rsquo;ll have to hear all about that day. &quot;</p>
<p>He was in tears.</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong said in a low voice: &ldquo;when Puzhi&rsquo;s younger brother returns to his senses, his blunder has already been cast. Standing in the sea of corpses and blood, he is like a thunderbolt and totally stupid. He had done a lot of harm to these innocent people and almost made him heartrending. In the confusion, he rushed back to Tianyin temple and saw me. What he did was nothing but to explain everything to me and the evil he had committed. In addition to my regret, I pray that in order to save one tenth of his sin in one hundred year old brother&rsquo;s fight, you must try your best to help him in the future if you are in trouble. &quot;</p>
<p>GUI Li tried his best to restrain his feelings, but he had no choice. He had never cried for decades. It seemed that a man who had been strong as iron had turned into tears at the moment. But seeing his teeth tightly gripping his lips, he fell deeply into it, and a trace of blood flowed out from the corners of his mouth more slowly. It was actually caused by his mind&rsquo;s agitation that he bit the corners of his mouth.</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong looked sad and said, &ldquo;younger martial brother Puzhi, he told us the last thing. The toxic attack finally came to an end. On his deathbed, he told him that his remains should not be cremated and buried, but were protected with jade ice plate to keep the remnant. He hoped that in the future, if the youth named Zhang Xiaofan knew the truth, he would invite him to come here and let him deal with the endless body of sin. It can also be used to whip moss and spit, or to frustrate the bones and raise ashes.

<p>The ghost&rsquo;s teeth closed tightly, and his eyes were deep, staring at master Pu Hong. Somehow, master Pu Hong didn&rsquo;t want to look at him, and slowly moved his eyes away.</p>
<p>Suddenly, he seemed to have made some determination. He turned around and strode out. Listening to his footsteps, he walked towards the last hut.</p>
<p>FA Xiang&rsquo;s face changed greatly and he said, &ldquo;master!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong slowly shook his head, and his face was deeply distressed and said in a low voice: &ldquo;let him go! That&rsquo;s also your last wish. How hard is the world? How many people can see it? Amitabha&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>He gently closed, silently recited, the room, an instant silence.</p>
<p>The silence is terrible! (to be continued. )</p>
