      <p>The Yin wind blows more and more fiercely, and the clothes of jinpinger and jinpinger are hunting. They stood at the entrance of the ancient cave of Zhenmo and watched the huge and strange evil spirits gradually appear in front of them.</p>
<p>The eyes of the size of a copper bell suddenly opened in the white air, and there was a faint blood red light shining through. The huge figure of the evil spirit shrouded him, and his eyes fell on the two mortals standing under him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who dares to come here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The voice of the evil spirit suddenly rang, and it was as if the surrounding mountain walls were shaking.</p>
<p>However, after a while, the evil spirit seemed to find something and was stunned for a moment, but his eyes turned to the gold bottle son standing by the ghost Li&rsquo;s body slightly back: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s you again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Golden Vase son tiny smile, charming infinite, way: &ldquo;yes! It&rsquo;s me. We meet again. &quot;</p>
<p>The evil spirit roared angrily, and the voice echoed far away, as if in the deep ancient cave behind him, his howling voice echoed far away: &ldquo;why do you come here again? Don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;s not enough to disturb the goddess last time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jinpinger is thinking about how to deal with this evil spirit. Judging from the situation of that day, the evil spirit guarding the ancient cave of the town is definitely not easy to deal with. But she thought, but her face was still smiling.</p>
<p>Jin Ping&rsquo;er was about to speak when he heard a sharp voice beside him: &ldquo;did you follow the exquisite Witch and go deep into the black tiger among the seven heroes in the south of 100000 mountains?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jin Ping&rsquo;er was shocked and turned to look at the ghost. However, he only saw the ghost&rsquo;s face indifferent and looked at the huge figure of the evil spirit.</p>
<p>Almost at the same time, the evil spirit could not help but stay for a moment, as if the name of &ldquo;black tiger&rdquo; hit him hard in some place in his heart.</p>
<p>Even if it is the incarnation of fierce ghosts and spirits, even if it is abandoned by the world and has been waiting for thousands of years alone, there are still some memories, deep in my heart</p>
<p>&ldquo;You Who is it? &quot; The ferocious and powerful voice, as if suddenly hoarse general, and just appeared. Completely changed.</p>
<p>The ghost looked at the voice surrounded by the ghostly spirit, and his eyes flashed with complicated and hard to see light. He said slowly: &ldquo;among the seven people who followed the exquisite witch, five went back at last. Later, five ethnic groups in southern Xinjiang were established. There are still two brothers, black tiger and black wood, who followed Linglong witch for the longest time, but they did not come back. According to the legend of the ancient witch clan, the elder brother black tiger is loyal and brave.</p>
<p>Heimu, the second younger brother, is persistent and persistent. I think you are extremely respectful to this statue. For thousands of years, you have been so tenacious that you have turned into a fierce spirit without regret. I guess you are a black tiger, right? &quot;</p>
<p>The ferocious spirit was silent for a long time, and his eyes were staring at him. Under the fierce eyes, however, there was no fear at all, and the front eyes looked at each other.</p>
<p>gradual. The dark and white ghost gas around the evil spirit was slowly surging, and the blood red color in the evil spirit&rsquo;s eyes became more and more intense. Even at the entrance of the ancient town Magic Cave, which was originally cold and piercing, the temperature seemed to be getting colder and colder.</p>
<p>Lying on the shoulder of the monkey small ash, seems to have some uneasiness, low call two.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you to know the past of the witch clan?&rdquo; The original angry voice of the ferocious spirit seemed to change suddenly, and there was indescribable coldness in the tone.</p>
<p>However, GUI Li didn&rsquo;t feel anything, just looked at the huge shadow. &ldquo;Most people in the world can&rsquo;t remember things that happened a long time ago, but there will still be legends, which will be handed down bit by bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at the evil spirit and said, &ldquo;today&rsquo;s southern Xinjiang. After the witch race, there are still some people who remember you! &quot;</p>
<p>The evil spirit&rsquo;s eyes were closed and had not been opened for a long time.</p>
<p>Gold bottle son stands behind, eyebrows slightly wrinkled up, looked at the evil spirit, and looked at the side of the ghost. She didn&rsquo;t know about these legends about the so-called Linglong gods of the ancient witch clan. However, judging from the reaction of the evil spirits, it was obvious that what the ghost said was the truth. For a long time, she thought that no one in the demon sect knew more about the strange things in the 100000 mountains than she did. However, it seemed that there was something hidden and unknown.</p>
<p>She looked at the figure of the man, slightly awe inspiring in her heart, but her eyes seemed colder.</p>
<p>For a long time, the wind was still blowing coldly. On top of the head, the black clouds turned silently, the cold wind was bleak, and the scenery was desolate.</p>
<p>In this silence, suddenly, the fierce black tiger suddenly raised his head and roared to the sky. His voice was shrill, as if there were countless vicissitudes of life in this roar. When the whistling was still faintly echoing in the distant mountains, he had already turned back, and the rumbling sound seemed to be the agitation of feelings, but it was suppressed after all.</p>
<p>Thank you very much</p>
<p>The ferocious spirit gazed at the ghost for a long time, and suddenly slightly bowed his head.</p>
<p>With no expression on his face, he slowly stepped back half a step, closed his eyes and bowed slightly, which was a salute.</p>
<p>The evil spirit nodded, and his voice gradually calmed down. He said, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe that there are still people in this world who remember our mother and us. Hey, but when we first followed the witch maiden into the 100000 mountains, where did we think of the eternal fragrance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The evil spirit&rsquo;s eyes slowly turned to the entrance of the ancient cave. His eyes became gentle and even his voice seemed to be much lighter: &ldquo;but you didn&rsquo;t come here to say these words to me, who is not human or ghost like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, before I came here, I had heard the legend of Linglong witch girl and you seven, but I didn&rsquo;t know what you were now, and I didn&rsquo;t know you would be here&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked up at the evil spirit and said slowly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here for the beast God in this cave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The huge figure of the ferocious spirit was shocked. It seemed that even he was afraid of the name.</p>
<p>However, the evil spirit&rsquo;s eyes did not spread, or stayed on the statue and said, &ldquo;what do you want him to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will find him and kill him,&rdquo; he said</p>
<p>The evil spirit suddenly turned back, staring at the ghost, and slowly said, &ldquo;depend on you two?&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li nodded slowly and said, &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The white ghost gas around the body of the evil spirit seemed to turn faster suddenly. It seemed that his figure was also a little blurred. After a long time, he only heard him say coldly: &ldquo;yes, the beast God is indeed in the ancient magic cave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gold bottle son body a shock, the face can not help but pass a glimmer of joy. GUI Li did not have many happy expression, or looking at the evil spirit.</p>
<p>The evil spirit was also looking at him, and suddenly said, &ldquo;I think your clothes and clothes should not be the natives of Southern Xinjiang. Is it from the Middle Earth? &quot;</p>
<p>He nodded his head and said, &ldquo;it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The evil spirit pondered for a moment. In the gloomy ghost spirit, it seemed to see that his expression changed. &ldquo;Do you know why I guarded this cave before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he said</p>
<p>The evil spirit said: &ldquo;naturally, I want to protect the goddess, but in addition, I am here to guard, one is not allowed to resurrect the evil spirit. Do you understand that you do not want ignorant people to die</p>
<p>He nodded grimly.</p>
<p>The evil spirit laughed miserably and said, &ldquo;but I still failed to live up to my mother&rsquo;s great trust. I was He was cheated by that animal and made a big mistake. The evil spirits came back to life, and the world was devastated&hellip; &quot; Speaking to the back, his voice also gradually lowered, and then, the evil spirit seemed to calm down. He added: &ldquo;I was already in despair. I wanted to come to the world and no one could stop this evil spirit from harming people. However, a few days ago, he was seriously injured and returned. The Chinese people are outstanding and there are even some experts who can be severely damaged by him. It&rsquo;s really beyond my expectation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He gave a slight twitch in the corner of his eyes, then sneered and said, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t have to care too much. Although the beast God is defeated. But the people who beat him may not be able to go anywhere! &quot;</p>
<p>The evil spirit was slightly stunned. I didn&rsquo;t know what the meaning of the words was, but I didn&rsquo;t want to go into it at the moment. He said: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the best to get rid of this evil spirit. I&rsquo;ve had it for thousands of years. I just hate that even if he hasn&rsquo;t recovered on that day, I can&rsquo;t help him. You are from the Middle Earth. It is unknown that you can do it. If you really succeed&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>The spirit of the evil spirit was suddenly stopped. He widened his eyes and said in a loud voice, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll thank you for your mother here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, he moved slowly and made way for a road, revealing the deep and bottomless ancient cave behind him.</p>
<p>He took a deep look into the cave, turned his eyes, and took a deep look at the evil spirit, who was also staring at him.</p>
<p>GUI Li nodded slowly, and no longer said anything more. He walked in slowly. Passing by the evil spirit, Xiaohui, a monkey lying on his shoulder, suddenly raised his head and looked at the huge body of the evil spirit curiously. His three eyes did not blink.</p>
<p>The evil spirit suddenly said in a loud voice to the ghostly back: &ldquo;there is one more thing, you should be careful. On that day, the beast God did not come back alone. In addition to the ferocious beast beside him, there was also a demon. His conduct was extremely high. You must be careful. &quot;</p>
<p>The ghostly step stopped for a moment and said, &ldquo;as far as I know, all the thirteen monsters under him have been completely destroyed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The evil spirit shook his head and said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not one of the thirteen monsters. Even I&rsquo;ve never seen that monster before. You must be careful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li nodded slowly and continued to walk towards the depth of the ancient cave.</p>
<p>Then, the Golden Vase son also slowly followed up, two people and a monkey&rsquo;s figure, slowly dissolved into the dark, in the shadow of the deep swaying forward, slowly, but finally can no longer see.</p>
<p>The evil spirit of the body gradually blurred, but his huge eyes were always staring at the darkness in the cave. Suddenly, he made a great roar like thunder towards the deepest and darkest place, which roared out like a torrent of mountains and seas. Even the cold wind came back for it, and the hard rock wall roared like the sky and the earth!</p>
<p>In the sound of howling, the ferocious huge body slowly disappeared in the dark</p>
<p>However, when the evil spirit disappeared, he did not notice that there was a black figure behind the statue outside the ancient cave. It was the black wood that instigated the civil strife of the five ethnic groups in southern Xinjiang on that day and took back the sacred utensils of the five clans and revived the beast gods.</p>
<p>The black and broad robe, as in the past, covered the whole body of Blackwood, sending out a cold air. However, in his eyes, there was a very complex vision flashing, looking at the depth of the ancient magic cave. When the evil spirit, who was also his elder brother, disappeared, he slowly withdrew his eyes and fell on the statue of the exquisite witch beside him.</p>
<p>In the chilly wind, he seems to be whispering: &ldquo;Niang&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the same time, a team of more than ten people came out of the vast black forest far away from the scorched black mountain where the ancient Zhenmo cave is located. The first one was a woman dressed in white like snow and beautiful in appearance. She had a blue Tianya fairy sword in her hand, and her face was like frost, but her eyes seemed to have indescribable sadness and vicissitudes. She was silent. Looking at the distant black mountain peak</p>
<p>Zhongtu, 30 Li outside Heyang city.</p>
<p>On the main road, after such a long time, most of the refugees have returned to their southern hometown. This place is not far from the foot of Qingyun Mountain, but people in rags can still be seen trudging. However, there are more peddlers and peddlers, which are much better than when the catastrophe happened a few months ago.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The immortal points out, look at your half life&hellip;&rdquo; Suddenly. There was a loud cry on the road, which broke the silence and seemed very harsh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fortune, official fortune, marriage, whereabouts; Feng Shui, facial features, character measurement, bone feeling, everything is exquisite and omnipotent. To come and come, you only need five Liang silver! It&rsquo;s cheaper&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>Monday immortal holding the sign of &ldquo;immortal guiding the way&rdquo;, strides over. All the way shouting, passers-by all sidetracked.</p>
<p>The wild dog Taoist who followed him did not speak and carried all his luggage as usual.</p>
<p>However, the little ring behind him seemed to be stunned for a moment. He raised his head from a book with a black cover and no words, which he had been watching carefully all the way. He was a little surprised and said, &ldquo;what did you say just now, grandfather? How much money do you have?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Monday fairy turned back, ha ha, a smile, daoguxianfeng, such as Tianjiang immortal general, stretched out five fingers. Solemnly said: &ldquo;five Liang silver.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan frowned and said, &ldquo;but yesterday you just called three Liang silver! What&rsquo;s the matter with you these days? Three days ago, we were still as good as ever. Each guest who looks at the photo collects five silver coins, but you&rsquo;d better. These days you&rsquo;ve been jumping up and up. The five money has risen to one or two. After one day, it has become two liang, and the previous day it has become three Liang. It&rsquo;s a good day. You just called five Liang&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan went to the side of Zhouxian, looked up and down carefully. She saw some hair in her eyes. She took a step back to dry cough and said, &ldquo;what are you looking at, little girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan ignored him, but reached out to reach out to the forehead of Monday immortal. Zhouxian was startled, took a step back and let it go, and said, &ldquo;what do you do with God and Tao?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little ring &ldquo;bah&rdquo; a, way: &ldquo;you are the God Road! I want to see if you have a fever. Your brain is burning</p>
<p>With that, she turned her head to the wild dog Taoist who was following him and asked, &ldquo;Taoist priest, do you think my grandfather is a little confused recently?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Because it was day, and Taoist wild dog had cloth on his face as usual, but his eyes were very bright. He was asked by Xiao Huan and laughed twice. Then he immediately nodded his head and said, &ldquo;he, er, I mean the elder is old, it&rsquo;s inevitable that there are some&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fart!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhou Yixian jumped up in front of him, furious.</p>
<p>Xiaohuan gave him a look and said, &ldquo;grandfather, what are you so excited about? I think what the Taoist priest said is very reasonable. I&rsquo;m afraid that you are really a bit old and muddled</p>
<p>It seems that Monday fairy couldn&rsquo;t hear the word &ldquo;old fool&rdquo;. He was even more angry and said, &ldquo;what do you two guys know? How old are you? How sophisticated are you? I&rsquo;m not&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Small ring snatches a way:&rdquo; is, then you pour to say to see, why do you go all out to raise price? &quot;</p>
<p>On Monday, the immortal hummed, and the immortal in his hand waved the bamboo pole to the scattered passers-by, and said, &ldquo;look at these people, and those people we met along the way, are they all refugees?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan nodded and said, &ldquo;yes, everyone is! Including us. &quot;</p>
<p>On Monday, the immortal smothered for a while, his old face turned a little red, and then he thought he didn&rsquo;t hear it.</p>
<p>Xiaohuan added: &ldquo;since they are all refugees and have left their hometown, I don&rsquo;t think there are many people who want to look at the photo. I was thinking about whether the price should be reduced, but you&rsquo;d better raise the price as much as you can, grandfather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Monday fairy put the bamboo pole behind him with both hands on his back and sneered: &ldquo;according to what you say, I&rsquo;m wrong. But do you think there are fewer or more people looking for us these days?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Huan was stunned for a moment and frowned, but the Taoist priest of the wild dog put in his mouth and said, &ldquo;speaking of it, it seems that there are more people looking at each other these days!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhou Yixian snorted again. With a satisfied look on his face, he said to Xiaohuan, &ldquo;what do you know when you are young? I&rsquo;ll tell you, it&rsquo;s not necessary to look at each other&rsquo;s faces when people leave their hometown under the great difficulties. However, this time is quite different. The catastrophe is so great that it is rare for thousands of years. The whole world is in great danger. No one knows if he will live tomorrow? Under this vision, is it not that everyone is flocking to me as an immortal to guide them</p>
<p>Small ring bowed his head to ponder, after a long time, he slowly shook his head and sighed, but there was a trace of perplexity on his face.</p>
<p>The wild dog Taoist is still a little confused. He can&rsquo;t help but say, &ldquo;why do you always raise the price of seeing pictures?&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Monday, the fairy turned his eyes and said, &ldquo;how can I teach you such profound knowledge?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wild dog Taoist ran into a nail, and then he shrank back. However, he only heard the little ring beside him sighed and said, &ldquo;I know a little bit about this now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wild dog Taoist and the Monday fairy were both surprised. The Monday fairy said, &ldquo;Oh, do you want to talk about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan shrugged his shoulders and said, &ldquo;but you expect that people in the world are in a state of panic and care little about their own lives. How many people pity their belongings? On the contrary, the higher you mention silver, the ordinary people think that this person&rsquo;s moral conduct is profound and extraordinary I didn&rsquo;t believe these tricks. I thought that idiots could see these tricks. Unexpectedly, many people could not see them. &quot;</p>
<p>Monday fairy shook his head and said, &ldquo;you are wrong, Xiao Huan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Small ring is astonished, way: &ldquo;what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Monday, the fairy said, &ldquo;you are all right. It&rsquo;s just the last sentence, but it&rsquo;s not that they can&rsquo;t see it. It&rsquo;s just that they can&rsquo;t see it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can&rsquo;t you see?&rdquo; he said</p>
<p>Zhou Yixian took a look at the people around him and said, &ldquo;how can all the people in the world be stupid? It&rsquo;s just a matter of life and death, but I don&rsquo;t know how many people don&rsquo;t believe themselves and would rather listen to others&rsquo; comfort. Most of what I said was about the rest of their lives, which would be much better than today&rsquo;s. With this in mind, they are relieved to pay silver. &quot;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan suddenly said, &ldquo;grandfather, are you really talking about physiognomy, or are you talking about them at random?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Monday fairy smile, said: &ldquo;I am nonsense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Huan and the wild dog Taoist looked at each other, but they couldn&rsquo;t speak for a moment.</p>
<p>Monday fairy looked up at the sky, looked at the long sky, looked at a long time, leisurely way: &ldquo;such a catastrophe, but one can not be two, otherwise the way of heaven will not allow it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Speaking of this, he looked back and said with a smile: &ldquo;in this case, the future life will naturally be much better than the life and death days now. I am not a liar! On the contrary, I have come all the way to comfort and advise countless displaced people, and I don&rsquo;t know how many people have revived their vitality and revived with my words. How can those monks and Taoists who stay in the temple all day long to chant Buddhist scriptures? &quot;</p>
<p>He reached out and patted Xiao Huan&rsquo;s head. His face was immortal and righteous. He had the feeling of compassion for the world. He went to hell to save all the people. It was the place of righteousness that he collected so much white money. If he didn&rsquo;t accept it, it was not enough to save people, but also the righteous vicissitudes of great compassion.</p>
<p>He then sighed: &ldquo;life is really lonely&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>There was no one&rsquo;s voice for a moment, but there was silence all around.</p>
<p>Monday fairy frowned, took his eyes from the sky above, and looked around.</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, you two, what are you doing so fast&hellip;&rdquo; (to be continued. )</p>
