<p>Although Feng Yan went out for many missions, he never had one so far away. After seeing the scene behind the scenes, he felt numb, not to mention Du Lingfei.</p>
<p>Fortunately, all the tough creatures we met along the way didn&rsquo;t launch any attacks on them. At most, they just took a look at them. It seems that there is something in them that will not arouse the antipathy of these creatures.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun speculates that maybe it is because they are the disciples of Lingxi sect, and here After all, it is the influence of Lingxi sect that covers the endless circle.</p>
<p>In this way, the three of them kept moving forward. They would send letters to the zongmen on a fixed day every month. Two months later, they finally arrived at the boundary of Lingxi sect, the Luoxing mountain range.</p>
<p>On the way, Feng Yan didn&rsquo;t want to attack secretly. However, all kinds of shocks along the way made him lose his mood. He was frightened all day. In addition, Bai Xiaochun was very cautious and always approached Du Lingfei. He was afraid of too much here and could not find a chance to attack him. Therefore, he always forbeared.</p>
<p>At the moment, when Feng yanwang is in the Luoxing mountain range, there is a dim light that can&rsquo;t be detected by outsiders when Feng yanwang looks at Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an iron heart trying to kill me What a feud. &quot; Bai Xiaochun is worried at the bottom of his heart. He is as careful as a hair and squints his small eyes. He knows Feng Yan&rsquo;s mind like the palm of his hand.</p>
<p>Luoxing mountain range is a north-south crisscross of mountains, looking at the end, like a dragon and snake lying down, as if to divide the land.</p>
<p>Even from a distance, it seems that the sky on the other side of the mountain range is not the same as here, and there is a faint color of blood.</p>
<p>It is said that many years ago, a star fell from the sky and exploded here, causing the ground to collapse, but some of it bulged high, forming this mountain range.</p>
<p>It is full of jungle, fierce animals, but there are also a variety of rare vegetation, which makes this place full of crisis, but there are always friars who venture into it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the falling star mountains.&rdquo; Du Lingfei slowly opened her mouth. She felt tired all the way. At the moment, she finally arrived at her destination. She was relieved at the bottom of her heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The last time Hou contacted zongmen, the mark was this area.&rdquo; Feng Yan patted the storage bag and found a compass like magic weapon in his hand.</p>
<p>There is a needle on the magic instrument, which is rotating rapidly at the moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;According to the regulations of the clan, the disciples who go out must pass their location to the sect every month. This Lingxi plate can let us find the last location where younger martial brother Hou sent out his position.&rdquo; As he was talking, the compass pointer in his hand suddenly stopped and pointed to a direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Found it!&rdquo; Feng Yan&rsquo;s body shook and went straight ahead. Du Lingfei also looked moved and followed him.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun looks at the falling star mountains in front of her. There are forests of trees and grass here, which are like a sea of forests. From time to time, there are sounds of birds and beasts. Even from afar, you can hear some fierce beasts roaring from the depths.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun has a dignified look, which inspires the protection light of the jade pendant, and ensures that he will be aware of any wind and grass movement at the first time. Then he moves forward cautiously and keeps a certain distance with Feng Yan.</p>
<p>Feng Yan and Du Lingfei did not stop at all. They galloped in the Luoxing mountain range at a high speed, and gradually went deep into a valley. There are many trees here, and these trees have many young heads at first sight. At first glance, they look like boa constrictors, and each section has a bulging knot. If it is at night, it will be shocking.</p>
<p>An hour later, three people in the deep valley, fierce pause, Feng Yan looked down at the compass in his hand, the above pointer clearly pointed to one side of a tree that needed to be surrounded by ten people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Younger martial brother Bai, go and have a look.&rdquo; Feng Yan looks at Bai Xiaochun and points to the big tree.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun hesitated for a moment and looked at the big tree carefully. After confirming that it was ok, he pressed the jade pendant on his waist with his right hand, which immediately covered the whole body with blue light. He even took out some runes and pasted them on his body. Then he slowly approached the big tree in three steps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so afraid of death, but I still come to practice!&rdquo; Du Lingfei snorted coldly. She was originally disgusted with Bai Xiaochun. Although she had been adventurous for many times along the way, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s performance there seemed to be the extreme fear of death every time. Now when she arrived at her destination, it was still the same, which made her more and more uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun didn&rsquo;t have time to pay attention to Du Lingfei. After cautiously approaching the big tree, Bai Xiaochun took out a flying sword and went to peel off the bark of the tree. He saw a new growing area, opened it up and found a jade slip hidden in it.</p>
<p>After slowly taking out the jade slips, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s divine sense swept her face slightly changed and threw it to Feng Yan.</p>
<p>There is only one word without end in the jade slips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have found out some other clues, and I want to go to the Luochen family to confirm it&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>After seeing it, Feng Yan frowned and threw the jade pendant to Du Lingfei, who frowned and pondered over it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Luochen family&hellip;&rdquo; After a while, Du Lingfei murmured and turned to look into the deeper part of the Luoxing mountains.</p>
<p>The Luoxing mountain range is very large and rich in resources. Such a place belongs to the Lingxi sect and is also at the junction with the Xuexi sect. The Lingxi sect naturally arranges people to protect it. The guarding family is The Luo Chen family.</p>
<p>There are a lot of Luochen family members. They have been stationed in the Luoxing mountains for thousands of years. Every generation has its ancestors who built foundations. It is enough to frighten or protect them.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s three people even have an explanation in their tasks. If they are in danger, they can contact the Luochen family.</p>
<p>But now hou Yunfei&rsquo;s jade slips actually point to the Luochen family, and it seems that He disappeared when he went to the Luochen family to verify something.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think? Shall we go to the Luochen family to have a look?&rdquo; Feng Yan&rsquo;s eyes seem to sweep Bai Xiaochun at will and look at Du Lingfei.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elder martial brother Feng and elder sister Du, we have finished our task to find this jade slip Safety is the priority, so there&rsquo;s no need to make such a fuss. &quot; Bai Xiaochun quickly opened his mouth and looked around, which made him feel a little depressed.</p>
<p>Du Lingfei hesitated for a moment. If she went back like this, she thought that the contribution points could only obtain the foundation, but if more clues were found out, there would be more contribution points.</p>
<p>Seeing Du Lingfei hesitated, Feng Yan frowned slightly. If he went back like this, he was worried that he would not find a chance to kill Bai Xiaochun, so he spoke calmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My idea is to take a look at the Luochen family. Since we are here, we can&rsquo;t leave like this. We should ask what happened to younger martial brother Hou. Besides, maybe we can ask the people of the Luochen family to help us search. In this way, we will get more contributions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides As long as we don&rsquo;t enter the deep of the Luoxing mountain range, we are just on the edge, and there is no danger. As for the Luoxing family, hum, all the Xiuzhen families within the scope of Lingxi sect have the mark of Lingxi sect in their blood. They can&rsquo;t betray us for generations. How dare you be rude to us. &quot; Feng Yan spoke slowly, then looked at Du Lingfei.</p>
<p>Du Lingfei nodded and felt that Feng Yan&rsquo;s words were reasonable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;OK, let&rsquo;s take a look at the Luochen family. Maybe senior brother Hou disappeared unexpectedly after he left the family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seeing Du Lingfei agree, Feng Yan smiles. When he looks at Bai Xiaochun, there is a cold flash in his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now that we have completed the task, why should we create extra branches?&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun frowned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you are afraid of death, don&rsquo;t follow.&rdquo; Du Lingfei ignores Bai Xiaochun, turns and shakes, and runs straight ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Younger martial brother Bai, Feng is also responsible for the assessment of the task. The three of us will advance and retreat together. If you don&rsquo;t go, it will be very difficult for me to do it when you come back to the clan.&rdquo; Feng Yan looks at Bai Xiaochun with a smile. He decides that Bai Xiaochun will follow him. Otherwise, Du Lingfei will testify and give him a review of dereliction of duty. He will not be able to pass the law enforcement hall alone.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s face was gloomy, and the blood flow was fast. When he looked at Feng Yan&rsquo;s back, blood gradually appeared in his eyes. Although he was afraid of death, he gradually understood that only by turning back on others and solving Feng Yan first was the safest way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Feng Yan, you forced me!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun stood there silent for a few minutes. Finally, she bowed her head and shook her head. She rushed out and followed Feng Yan and Du Lingfei. The three gradually disappeared in the jungle.</p>
<p>Two hours later, with the three people on their way, it was already dusk. With the setting sun in the distance, the jungle was also gradually dark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here it is!&rdquo; Feng Yan suddenly opened his mouth, and the three of them stopped walking. When they looked up, they all saw that in front of them, there were fewer trees and many bluestones on the ground, which spread out into an area.</p>
<p>In this area, there are several quadrangles, which form a large house. It seems that hundreds of people can live in it. However, it is still at dusk. It should be the busiest time in a family. However, the house is dark and silent. It seems to blend with the night, giving people a sense of desolation.</p>
<p>Only the two lanterns hanging in front of the gate gave out dim light and there was no wind around. However, the two lanterns swayed gently, making the two stone lions standing in front of the door under the lanterns looked gloomy.</p>
<p>This scene makes Feng Yan and Du Lingfei look different.</p>
<p>As for Bai Xiaochun, when he saw the house, a sense of crisis suddenly rose in his heart, as if every piece of flesh and blood was screaming at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something is wrong&hellip;&rdquo; Feng Yan also felt a thump in his heart, but he didn&rsquo;t finish his words.</p>
<p>Suddenly, creak, the door of the house, slowly opened, a wind blowing out, vaguely, like a figure, silent appeared in the door.</p>
