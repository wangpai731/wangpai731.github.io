      <p>At supper, it was dark.</p>
<p>On the Dazhu Peak, Houshan is a whole piece of bamboo forest. The housing of all people is in Qianfeng. The biggest and most important thing is the main hall guarding the quiet hall. Tian Yiji and his three daughters live in the back hall. Next to the Shoujing Hall is the small corridor where all the disciples live, but because there are too few people, there are more houses than everyone. Everyone lives in a room alone, even the newly arrived Zhang Xiaofan has a room. In terms of living conditions alone, Dazhufeng has surpassed all others in the same line.</p>
<p>All that remains is the Tai Chi cave and the kitchen and dining room. At this time, all the disciples gathered in the dining room, and the old sixth dubius, who was in charge of the meal, brought the dishes to the table, mostly vegetarian dishes, and there was little meat. The disciples were seated on the right side of the long table in the hall, Song Daren sat at the forefront, and Zhang Xiaofan accompanied the last seat. A large chair and two smaller chairs were placed on the table and opposite, which seemed to be prepared for Tian Yi&rsquo;s family.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan looked at the seat that was still empty around him. It was the busy seat of the old sixth Du Bishu. After a while, Du Bishu finally finished his meal, washed his hands, sat back in his seat, and waited for the master with everyone.</p>
<p>Du Bishu looked quite young, his face was thin and pointed, his eyes were triangular, his thieves were dexterous, and he was very clever. After he sat down, he looked at Zhang Xiaofan and smiled, &ldquo;Little Brother, what is your name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan honestly said: &ldquo;Zhang Xiaofan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Du Bishu nodded, pointed at himself, and said, &ldquo;I am your six brother Du Bishu.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan shouted respectfully: &ldquo;Six Brothers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Du Bishu coughed, patted his shoulder, and smiled: &ldquo;Wait a moment, you will try Brother&rsquo;s craft.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan saw that the aroma of the table full of food was striking, he could not help swallowing, and nodded vigorously.</p>
<p>Du Bishu smiled suddenly, with a lot of ambiguity. He pointed at the entrance of the hall and said, &ldquo;Little Brother, wait a minute, Master and Mother and Little Sister will come in from there. Let&rsquo;s make a bet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan stayed for a while, everyone else on the seat turned his head, all smiles on his face, the old Wu Lu Daxin sitting above Du Bishu smiled and said: &ldquo;Lao Liu, are you gambling addiction again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He Dazhi, who was lean and lean next to him, smiled and said: &ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t won in a long time, now he&rsquo;s going to lie to children?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go, go, go!&rdquo; Du Bishu waved again and again, ignoring everyone, with a smile on his face, and said to Zhang Xiaofan: &ldquo;Young Master, guess who would be the three of the Master&rsquo;s family, who would be the first to enter this door? Huh?&rdquo; , You just started, let you guess first, let alone being bullied by Brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wu Dayi, the second son sitting in the distance, shouted loudly: &ldquo;Little brother, that is, betting, you first ask him what he lost and what he won?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Du Bishu snorted and said, &ldquo;Are you afraid that I will be disappointed? My Du Bishu walks around the world, relying on the famous gambling rivers and lakes (everyone laughs: you won&rsquo;t win!), little teacher, if you guessed it , I will help you cut bamboo for ten days, if you lose, then help me wash the dishes for ten days, how?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everyone laughed again, Song Daren laughed and scolded: &ldquo;There is no good news.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan saw the brothers with a kind smile and kind attitude, and did not regard himself as an outsider. He felt warm for a while and said, &ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Du Bishu shot his thighs, and the whole person suddenly looked radiant and radiant, and said, &ldquo;Little Brother, then you said Master, sister and sister, who will come first?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s eyes fell on Zhang Xiaofan. Zhang Xiaofan figured in his mind that Qingyunmen respected the teacher first. Presumably it was Master Tian Nan who came in first. The loud voice at the moment: &ldquo;I guess it must be Master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everyone laughed, Lu Daxin shook his head and said: &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think that I was really cheated by the sixth son today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Du Bishu was unbearable and looked at Zhang Xiaofan with a confused face, he said happily: &ldquo;Little Brother, tell you, in fact, every time the Master&rsquo;s family is the first to be rushed into by the little sister. Haha, you will come and wash me if you stay Bowl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan touched his head and couldn&rsquo;t help but also smiled and nodded, &ldquo;Yes, Brother Six.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zheng Dali, who was short and strong in the third place, smiled and said: &ldquo;Lao Liu, are you also embarrassed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Du Bishu groaned his eyes and said, &ldquo;What are you talking about, my third son? I&rsquo;m not forced to do it. Everyone is willing to gamble to lose. Isn&rsquo;t it, Junior Brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan nodded and suddenly heard Song Daren said: &ldquo;Master is here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s complexion stood up, facing the door and welcoming the teacher. A moment later, Tian&rsquo;s not stupid body appeared at the door, and behind him was&hellip;</p>
<p>Nothing!</p>
<p>He came alone.</p>
<p>Everyone stayed together, and Du Bishu couldn&rsquo;t help but snatch: &ldquo;Master, what about the maid and the younger sister?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Yijian glanced at him lightly and said: &ldquo;Your sister-in-law brought her little sister back to her family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everyone was stunned, but a moment later someone couldn&rsquo;t help but laugh out, watching Tian Tian not easy to walk in, Zhang Xiaofan was embarrassed, he was afraid to laugh, but Du Bishu was dumbfounded.</p>
<p>Tian was not easy to sit on his big chair and waved: &ldquo;Let’s eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The disciples sat down and looked at Du Bishu with a smile. Tian Xiu looked at Zhang Xiaofan and said to Song Daren: &ldquo;Did you tell him the rules and rules?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren nodded and said, &ldquo;Yes, I have told the younger brothers about the twelve rules and twenty precepts. As for the basic practice of Taoism, the disciples see that the younger brothers are a little tired at the beginning of the day, and they plan to officially teach tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian easily nodded, agreed, and said to Zhang Xiaofan: &ldquo;Lao Qi.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan didn&rsquo;t know how to come, but Du Bishu pushed him around, and then he realized that Master was calling himself and quickly stood up and said, &ldquo;The disciple is here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian couldn’t shake his head easily, and went a little further in his confidence in this unresponsive disciple. He said: “You follow the master first, remember to learn hard, the sea is endless, the diligence is the boat, even if the qualifications are poor, But as long as you persevere hard, you may not be able to learn it, you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>If Zhang Xiaofan is sacred, he respectfully and honestly said: &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian is not easy to wave his hand: &ldquo;Dine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was short, sitting on a chair with a big bowl, and he couldn’t get any dishes farther away, but Du Bishu beside him was quite kind. He pinched him several times and whispered with a low voice: &quot; Younger brother, eat more.&rdquo; It doesn&rsquo;t matter if he looks like he doesn&rsquo;t care about losing, and the gambling is not bad.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was grateful, nodded again and again, and secretly asked, &ldquo;Six Brothers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Du Bishu turned his head and said, &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan said: &ldquo;Why do the teachers and mothers still have natal families?&rdquo; In his little care, the Qingyunmen people are first-class immortals, how can there be worldly concerns.</p>
<p>Du Bishu said: &ldquo;Of course, Master and Mother are also human. But Master said that Mother and Mother returned to their mother&rsquo;s home, not really their mother&rsquo;s home, but that she went back to Uncle Xiaozhu Fengshuiyue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was surprised: &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Du Bishu lowered his voice and said, &ldquo;When the young lady was born in the same vein as Xiaozhufeng, and the first master Shuiyue of Xiaozhufeng was the sister of the teacher, the relationship was very good. Later, I don&rsquo;t know how it happened. , Actually married Master, I heard that many male teachers and uncles of Qingyunmen couldn&rsquo;t think of it&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poof&rdquo;, a pair of chopsticks hit Du Bishu&rsquo;s forehead. The two were startled, but they saw that Tian was not angry, and there was one chopstick missing in his hand. Du Bishu turned his head to Zhang Xiaofan, and the two dared not say anything, bowing their heads to eat hard.</p>
<p>At this time, Song Daren was not easy to tell Tian: &ldquo;Master, this time the real person convenes the Seven Veins gathering, why is it that only Uncle Shuiyue did not come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Anhou snorted, picked up another pair of chopsticks, and said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not the old lady who pretends to be sick, and sent someone to say to the brother-in-law that there is no headache and fever. The brother-in-law, too, couldn&rsquo;t believe it. Huh , If she comes here today, even if I can’t grab a good one, I don’t necessarily have to share it&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The four disciples He Dazhi coughed twice and whispered, &ldquo;Master, Uncle Shuiyue never accepts male disciples.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian was not suffocated, shook his head, and said: &ldquo;And your maid, when I heard about Shuiyue&rsquo;s problems, I immediately took Linger to see her. It was like the sky was falling, really.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the disciples looked at each other, and they were all happy, and Song Daren hesitated a moment before asking tentatively, &ldquo;Master, then I don&rsquo;t know how long the teacher will stay with Uncle Shuiyue?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Hao didn&rsquo;t glare at him, and he said angrily: &ldquo;What time, go today, and return tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; All the disciples sighed aloud, all disappointed. Tian Anyi didn&rsquo;t seem to see it, he snorted, and said to Song Daren: &ldquo;Teacher and sister guide you to practice again today?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren hadn&rsquo;t spoken yet, and the second son, Wu Dayi, had already snatched: &ldquo;Master Mo wants to ask him, Master is about to escape today, so shameless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren said angrily: &ldquo;Nonsense, I was instructed by the Master to help the younger brother&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Appeal&hellip;&rdquo; Everyone booed.</p>
<p>After half a hour of this meal, after everyone left, Zhang Xiaofan wanted to stay and help Du Bishu wash the dishes, but Du Bishu smiled and said: &ldquo;Little brother, thank you, but I can do everything here. You bet to win. After me, rest assured, I&rsquo;ll cut bamboo for you tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was a little embarrassed and was about to say something, but he heard Song Daren&rsquo;s voice saying: &ldquo;Lao Liu, don&rsquo;t help him.&rdquo; As soon as the words fell, he saw Song Daren coming in from the door and said to Zhang Xiaofan: &quot; Brother, come, I will take you to your room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan nodded, but Du Bishu said aside: &ldquo;Brother, what do you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren said: &ldquo;The little teacher has just started, and is about to lay a good foundation, it is not time to be lazy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Du Bishu scratched his head and said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the same, little brother, this time when I owe you once, what will you do for me in the future, just say, okay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan said: &ldquo;Six Brothers, otherwise we forget, anyway&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Du Bishu&rsquo;s face was solemn, and Da Yi said awfully: &ldquo;What kind of words, am I the kind of person who is right and wrong, loyal and irresponsible? I promised that you would naturally do it, otherwise you will fall behind and you will be ridiculed by all your brothers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan nodded, but he still didn&rsquo;t understand what had to do with whether it was right or wrong, and loyalty.</p>
<p>Song Daren took Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s hand and said, &ldquo;Little Brother, come, I will take you to your new room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two walked out of the kitchen, and the sky was already dark. A bright moon rose slowly and hung on Dongtian. They walked past the entrance of Shoujing Hall, and Zhang Xiaofan looked in, and saw that the lights were all turned off and it was dark, and only the moonlight was sprinkled in front of the hall, which was quite eerie.</p>
<p>After another walk, they returned to the corridor where the disciples lived. Song Daren took him to a room at the end of the right head and said, &ldquo;Little Master, I lived in the room when you woke up during the day. The other teachers and brothers lived in turn, all on the right, and the seven rooms on the left were unoccupied.&rdquo; After a pause, he looked at Zhang Xiaofan and said: &ldquo;You live alone, are you afraid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan shook his head.</p>
<p>Song Daren smiled and said: &ldquo;This is it. How can our man husband be afraid of loneliness! Come, let&rsquo;s go in.&rdquo; Then he walked in with Zhang Xiaofan.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan looked at this unfamiliar place that will be accompanied for a long time in the future: a small courtyard, a green pine on the left, five or six bamboos on the right, two or three people tall. In the courtyard, small pebbles are paved as trails, and lawns are on both sides. The night wind blows, the leaves and bamboo branches shake gently, and a scent of grass and grass comes from it, it is very clean.</p>
<p>Song Daren opened the door, went in and lit the lamp, and said, &ldquo;Young Master, come in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan walked in, and saw that the furnishings in the house were as simple and simple as those in Song Daren&rsquo;s room, with tables, chairs and beds, and nothing beside them.</p>
<p>Song Daren said: &ldquo;Today I have cleaned this place, so please stay here for a while. The mountain dwelling is bitter, you are young and you may feel lonely, but those of us who learn the Tao should endure all kinds of hardship You have to do it yourself after life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan said: &ldquo;Got it, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren nodded, then looked to the left and right again, and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go back if there&rsquo;s nothing wrong. If you are tired all day, go to rest early.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan responded and sent his brother to the door. He suddenly remembered something and said, &ldquo;Brother, why didn&rsquo;t you just get into the darkness now, and all the brothers didn&rsquo;t come out and walk around?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren smiled and said, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know, the least we have been to this Dazhufeng for decades, it is rare to go out on weekdays, this Dazhufeng has long been familiar with shopping, so they are too lazy to walk around, like the old fourth love reading The second child loves to hum, and the hardworking ones like the third one will practice in the house, but they usually don’t come out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan realized this, and Song Daren touched his head with a smile, and then told him a few words, and turned away.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan returned to the house and closed the door. Suddenly he felt that the whole world was quiet, and there was no human voice. He walked silently to the table and sat there for a while. When there was nothing to do, he blew out the lights and took off his coat and lay down on the bed. Tossing and turning, I didn&rsquo;t know how long it took, and fell asleep in a daze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;what!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the dark, Zhang Xiaofan yelled and sat up, panting. Just now he dreamed of returning to the Caomiao Village, seeing his father and mother again, seeing all the children’s playmates, and other uncles and aunts, and they were happy, but suddenly they all became dead bodies, blood flowing into the river, horror Extremely. He shook his body and woke up like this.</p>
<p>He sat on the bed for a while, his breathing gradually calmed, and his eyes slowly adjusted to the darkness, only to see the window tilted slightly, there was a faint moonlight, obliquely shining into it, sprinkled on the blue brick floor, like frost and snow.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was sleepless, climbed up and walked to the door, and with a loud bang, he opened the door and went out.</p>
<p>There was no sound around, there were humming sounds from unknown places, one or two sounds, low and low, Yuehua like water, sprinkled on him.</p>
<p>He looked up at the sky and saw the stars, the moon was just empty, bright and bright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what happened to Yu Yu, can&rsquo;t he fall asleep?&rdquo; He sighed lowly, sighed, and turned to enter the room. Suddenly his chest loosened, and something rolled out of the tights. ,drop on the floor.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was startled, leaned over and picked it up, but it was a dark purple dull round bead, with a small hole in the middle of the bead, which seemed to be the same day that Pu Zhizhi strung on the emerald rosary. He has been undergoing great changes these days and has long forgotten this thing. Now he remembers that Pu Zhi told him to throw away this bead.</p>
<p>Thinking of this, my heart suddenly suffered, and his father and mother did not leave him anything. Pu Zhi was close to him, but he met with his relatives overnight, and this ugly bead was the only one that Pu Zhi left him. s things.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan raised his hand and raised the bead to mid-air, facing the moonlight, lining Yuehua Qinghui. I saw that the color of the bead actually became a little lighter, turning into a lavender, which was translucent, and I saw a faint light inside. The green gas rotates continuously, seems to have spirituality, and wants to break out of the shell. It&rsquo;s just that every time Qingqi approaches the surface of the bead, a small &ldquo;*&rdquo; will light up there, blocking it back.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan looked at it for a long time, but he didn&rsquo;t know how much he liked it. He also remembered that this was the only thing that Pu Zhi remembered, and he couldn&rsquo;t bear to lose it. After thinking for a long time, a red string was untied from his neck, it was his father and mother who tied him up to protect him for a long life and peace. Most people will hang some gold and silver locks, but his family is poor and can only be replaced by a red rope.</p>
<p>Now he put the beads on a red string and tied them up, and hung them on the chest to stick to the flesh, not cold, but still warm. He smiled for himself, looked up at the bright moon again, turned around and walked back to the room, and went to sleep again.</p>
<p>This is the end of his first day at Qingyun Gate.</p>
