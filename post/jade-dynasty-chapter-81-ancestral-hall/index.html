      <p>There are two important places in the back mountain of Qingyun Mountain. One is the most important holy land of Qingyun gate, the magic moon cave. The amazing founder of Qingyun gate thousands of years ago closed his door and became the leader of the world.</p>
<p>After the founder of Qingye, the magic moon cave became the most sacred place of Qingyun sect. For thousands of years, only the leader could enter here.</p>
<p>The other place is the ancestral hall.</p>
<p>As the name suggests, it is the place where the ancestors of Qingyun gate are worshipped. From Qingyun son who founded Qingyun gate to Qingye ancestor to the ancestors of all generations, there are holy places in the ancestral hall of Qingyun gate. They are full of fragrance every day. And every important day, under the leadership of the headmaster, Qingyun sect will ceremoniously worship the ancestors here, which is also an important part of Qingyun sect.</p>
<p>But in addition to the day of ancestor worship, it is very cold here. When Lin Jingyu led the four disciples of the demon sect into this place, he saw a magnificent hall, with four cornices, glazed tile roofs, and red pillars of antique doorplates, all of which seemed to tell the history of the past in this quiet place.</p>
<p>From the outside, we can see that there are a lot of candles in the hall, and the long light is shaking and hanging in the air. However, except for an old man in plain clothes who sweeps the floor in silence in front of the palace, no one can be seen.</p>
<p>At this time, heard the rapid footsteps, the old man slowly raised his head, looking here.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu regretted for a while. At that time, he just wanted to lead the people of the demon sect away from the magic moon cave, but he mistakenly went to the ancestral hall, where the ancestral throne was enshrined. If it was destroyed by the people of the demon sect, he could not be blamed!</p>
<p>As soon as he thought about this, Lin Jingyu stopped, cut the dragon sword in front of him, and turned to face the fake Shangguan policy and others.</p>
<p>At this time, the distant woods suddenly have birds to start, a burst of noise.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu was shocked. Looking at that direction is where Zhang Xiaofan is, I can&rsquo;t help worrying. But after all, I know that there is a big enemy in front of me. I have made up my mind secretly. Even if I die here today, I will never let these evil sect thieves step into the ancestral hall.</p>
<p>The Dragon cutting sword seems to have aura. The green light is shining against its master&rsquo;s face. Perseverance is the best.</p>
<p>The old man sweeping the floor in front of the ancestral hall looked at the Dragon cutting sword in Lin Jingyu&rsquo;s hand, and suddenly his body was shocked.</p>
<p>The four people of the demon sect over there all smiled at each other. Obviously, these people are not inferior in the demon sect. At a glance, they can see that this place must be the important place of Qingyun sect. It seems that this time there will be a great harvest.</p>
<p>The fake official said with a smile, &ldquo;little guy, I think you have good qualifications. Now Qingyun gate has no way to go. Why don&rsquo;t you join us? I promise you will be prosperous in the future! &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bah! &ldquo;Lin Jingyu was disgusted. A sneer, no reason.</p>
<p>The fake official did not get angry. He he sneered and said, &ldquo;well, since you are going to die, I will complete you! &ldquo;Then, with a wink, the other three men in black attacked.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu clenched his teeth and cut the dragon sword, which was rippling in front of him. The magic weapon used by the three men in black is a yellow flying sword and a powerful long halberd. Another is the most strange and terrifying. It&rsquo;s a white bone sword made of several bones. It&rsquo;s full of Yin Qi.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu fought hard with one enemy and three. The Dragon cutting sword is green and the guards are in the same place, but gradually they are still in the downwind.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu&rsquo;s talent is excellent when he enters Qingyun gate. Taoist Cangsong attaches great importance to him. Not only did he teach him carefully, but even the Dragon cutting sword with great potential was handed to him. I don&rsquo;t know if he saw the shadow of the man he admired in the past.</p>
<p>And Lin Jingyu did not fail to live up to the painstaking efforts of Taoist Cangsong. In just a few years, with his excellent talent and the deep-rooted belief in revenge for his parents and relatives, Taoism has made rapid progress, and has been the leader of the younger generation of disciples for several years.</p>
<p>He was only allowed to work hard again, but his practice was ultimately limited by time and could not be too radical. At the moment, facing the three disciples of the evil cult in black, the halberd in the front kept falling, while the flying sword next to him was aiming at the air to sneak in; what&rsquo;s more, the white bone sword, with the cold Yin Qi, suddenly appeared under the control of the evil cult man. Every time he blocked it, he could not help but take a breath of cool Qi and shiver.</p>
<p>In such a bitter fight for dozens of rounds, even though Lin Jingyu defended with all his strength, the green light of the dragon sword was gradually overwhelmed by the three men in black. Seeing his defeat, he finally stepped back.</p>
<p>The fake superior officer standing behind made a sneer.</p>
<p>The three men in black were in high spirits. All the magic weapons were out, and Lin Jingyu was sweating. He stepped back one after another. He wanted to stand but could not.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the mysterious white bone sword suddenly disappeared. Lin Jingyu was holding back the long halberd that he had smashed. Then he swung the flying sword that was attacking from the side. Unexpectedly, he felt a pain at his feet and couldn&rsquo;t stand when he stepped on it. It was the white bone sword that sneaked into the ground at some time. When it came, it cut a big hole in his right leg. It was bloody.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu roared, and the dragon sword fell into the sky. The immortal family&rsquo;s immortal soldier hit the white bone sword, and it crackled slightly. The owner of the white bone sword fell out immediately, and there was a slight crack on the sword.</p>
<p>The man of the demon sect who used the white bone sword suffered a lot. He quickly took the white bone sword back and looked at it carefully. But at this time, the magic weapon of the other two people has arrived. The wind is cold. Lin Jingyu is in the death place. He uses his last strength to control and cut the Dragon Sword across his head.</p>
<p>With a loud bang, I saw the strange light flickering and sparks shooting all around. I didn&rsquo;t know where the power came from. The Dragon chopping Jiansheng stopped the two magic weapons, but Lin Jingyu was also in the dark. In this moment of lightning and stone fire, he lost his mind for a moment, and suddenly saw the fake shangce standing in the distance appeared in front of him, grinning at himself.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu lost his color in a panic, but before he could react, he felt a deep pain in his chest, and a sharp force came in, piercing all his body protection methods instantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! &quot;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu roared, and the whole man flew out, spouting blood. He couldn&rsquo;t hold the dragon sword. The body of the sword rolled in the air. The last brush fell into the ground, just in front of the old man sweeping the floor.</p>
<p>The green light flows, and gradually becomes dim.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu has always been stubborn. He looks down at his chest, but he sees a piece of flesh and blood. The real wound is the size of a fingertip. But at the moment, a rush of energy rushed into the body, which was like an impregnable fine needle. The internal meridians were so painful that they wanted to stand up and meet the enemy again. Unexpectedly, the foot of a soft, it is unable to stand up!</p>
<p>He gasped for breath, but the fake shangguance and others laughed and were extremely proud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up, little man? I only use 50% of my mana. I will fight you like this. You are not coming down soon! &quot;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu&rsquo;s muscles twitched on his face. Obviously, his body was in great pain. But he was extremely worried by the impending difficulties. When he thought of the ancestral hall behind him, he didn&rsquo;t know where his strength came from. He struggled to get up slowly.</p>
<p>The devil cult and others didn&rsquo;t stop him, just watching monkey opera.</p>
<p>The pain in the cone&rsquo;s heart seemed to rush to the top of his head. Before Lin Jingyu could stand still, he was dizzy again. Turning his head and gasping for breath, he stumbled towards the dragon sword in front of the old sweeper. He gasped and said, &ldquo;old man, it&rsquo;s dangerous here. Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man looks like the person who cleans the ancestral hall in Qingyun gate. His face is haggard and wrinkled like a knife. It&rsquo;s strange to say that Lin Jingyu fought with all the people of the demon sect, but he also stood quietly and watched, neither escaping. He didn&rsquo;t talk.</p>
<p>At the moment, I saw him look at Lin Jingyu&rsquo;s chest, and suddenly he said lightly, &ldquo;away from the human cone! Are you Zhou Yin, the assassin of the immortal devil sect? &quot;</p>
<p>The smile of the four people of the demon sect was smothering, and the appearance of the official policy was suddenly cold, saying, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine there are still senior people here. pretty good. I&rsquo;m Zhou Yin. Who is your excellency? &quot;</p>
<p>The haggard old man didn&rsquo;t answer him, and said to himself, &ldquo;the parting cone is a magic treasure of the demon sect. It has great power, but it falls into the hands of people like you who are inferior in character, but it is only a tool for plotting against people. End is insulted this rare treasure! &quot;</p>
<p>Zhou Yin was furious, but he couldn&rsquo;t figure out the identity of the mysterious old man for a while. He saw that although he was trembling, his voice was very frightening, and he couldn&rsquo;t help feeling uneasy. He said angrily, &ldquo;who are you? &quot;</p>
<p>The old man sighed and said, &ldquo;who am I? Hey, even I forget who I am. &ldquo;When he spoke, his face was sorrowful and his tone was full of desolation. Then he turned to Lin Jingyu, who was stunned,&rdquo; son. &quot;</p>
<p>Lin startled, and hurriedly said, &ldquo;yes, sir. &quot;</p>
<p>The old man looked at him up and down, as if with a smile, and said, &ldquo;who are you? &quot;</p>
<p>For some reason, Lin Jingyu suddenly felt an unspeakable awe towards the old man, and said in a low voice, &ldquo;my disciple is under the gate of Taoist Cangsong of Longshou peak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the middle of the conversation, I suddenly remembered that Taoist Cangsong had betrayed Qingyun. Suddenly, a sense of inexplicable taste came to my heart. My heart was so sour that I couldn&rsquo;t speak any more.</p>
<p>The old man nodded and whispered, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s Cangsong! He has a good eye for his apprentice. &quot;</p>
<p>In his voice, he reached out his hand tremblingly and grasped the Dragon cutting sword in front of him.</p>
<p>Looking at his slow movement, Lin Jingyu suddenly felt nervous, as if he was expecting something from his heart. He could not help but hold his breath.</p>
<p>That pair of withered and old palms, don&rsquo;t know how much wind and frost he has experienced, when he once again touched the hard and cold hilt, then, clenched it!</p>
<p>In the ancestral hall, there was a faint sound of bells and tripods.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jingle&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly, the originally dark dragon cutting sword suddenly rises green, and the full light is like the sun in the sky, dazzling but not forced to look! The old man slowly pulled out the Dragon cutting sword. Every minute, the Dragon cutting sword seemed to tremble with excitement. The Dragon chanted incessantly, and the soul shaking voice reverberated to the sky.</p>
<p>The old man stood up straight, slowly put the big green dragon sword in front of him, and gently stroked it with his hand. The calloused hand eroded by the years is as gentle as touching the beloved woman.</p>
<p>The sword is roaring. Even though Lin Jingyu and the people of the demon sect are far away, they feel the excitement of the sword.</p>
<p>Lin startled Yu and looked at the Dragon cutting sword which he could hardly recognize. It radiated incomparable brilliance on the old man&rsquo;s hand. After the withered old man grasped the magic sword, the whole man seemed to have changed, and the invisible momentum was surging, as if he were the legendary ancient sword God.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My child, you can see that the Dragon cutting sword is not used like you! &ldquo;The old man said faintly in the surging blue light.</p>
<p>The voice just fell, suddenly saw bimang suddenly burst out, the whole open space was suddenly covered by green, the curtain. In the howling sound, the Dragon cutting sword flew out of the old man&rsquo;s hands. Such as the sharp flash of electric light, rushing out quickly.</p>
<p>Seeing the old man&rsquo;s great momentum, the devil cult people have been on guard for a long time. Now they shout. At the same time, he took the magic weapon to attack, only Zhou Yin stood at the end, frowned tightly, but did not make a move.</p>
<p>The three men almost used the same method to deal with Lin Jingyu just now, and the long halberd attacked head-on. When the flying sword rises, the white bone sword is about to attack. Unexpectedly, the old man doesn&rsquo;t care about the Yellow flying sword and the white bone sword at all. He cuts the dragon sword and makes it like a pillar of light. The disciples of the demon sect that led to the long halberd were shocked. They hurriedly controlled the long halberd to parry. They only heard a crisp sound. The Dragon cutting sword was like cutting ice and snow. Sheng Sheng cut the long halberd into two parts, without any pause. Beheaded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hiss&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Lin Jingyu&rsquo;s stupefaction, and in everyone&rsquo;s frightened eyes, the man of the demon sect was cut into two parts from head to foot, and the blood rain flowed. And there was almost no rest. In the sky of bloodstain, the green awn almost like the devil rolled up and rushed to the other two.</p>
<p>Originally, the flying sword and white bone sword that attacked the old man were split in heart at the moment. No one dared to attack. They flew back at once. At the same time, the magic weapon. But the Dragon cutting sword was sharp and full of light. In an instant, it hit people&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>There was hardly a scream, and the green mans drowned the two men. In a moment, the sound of fragmentation burst up. I don&rsquo;t know what happened to the two people?</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu was sweating, and his mind was seized by it!</p>
<p>Standing at the farthest distance, Zhou Yin&rsquo;s face changed greatly. Knowing that the old man was really a terrible man, he was not his enemy, so he turned around and flew away.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the green light is like the roaring of mountains and seas. In the middle of the room, there was a mixture of red blood, like a flash of lightning flying over, coming straight after.</p>
<p>After all, Zhou Yin&rsquo;s Taoism was higher than others. His hands suddenly shook, and he saw a flash of black air. The green light in the sky even made a meal in front of him.</p>
<p>At the next moment, Zhou Yin suddenly lost his color and said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s you! You are Wan. &quot;</p>
<p>The voice of the words did not fall, and the mountain green light filled the sky and earth poured down the black air pressure which was hard to support, and chopped it down in Zhou Yin&rsquo;s chest.</p>
<p>Zhou Yin screamed, and the whole man was beaten far away. He was dead.</p>
<p>In a moment, the four people of the demon sect who just boasted were all dead.</p>
<p>All over the sky, suddenly like a long whale absorbing water, it converged on the Dragon cutting sword and flew back to the old man.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu opened his mouth slightly, but he couldn&rsquo;t speak.</p>
<p>The old man shook his head slightly as if he was sighing something. Then he looked at the dragon sword in his hand and threw it to Lin Jingyu.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu catches him subconsciously, only to hear the old man return to the ancestral hall, and slowly say, &ldquo;cut the dragon sword, take the green crystal from the extremely bitter south of Xinjiang, and kill countless evils. If you want to use this sword, you need to go forward, attack first, and even if you don&rsquo;t have enough practice, you also need to be determined to kill all the strong enemies. If you don&rsquo;t, you can&rsquo;t exert your power.</p>
<p>Keep it in mind! &quot;</p>
<p>Lin was shocked, but when he saw that the old man was about to enter the ancestral hall, he suddenly woke up and said in a hurry, &ldquo;master, today, the demon sect has attacked Qingyun in a big way. Please do something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man&rsquo;s body suddenly stopped, but he didn&rsquo;t turn around. He said lightly, &ldquo;the master of Qingyun sect is like a cloud, and the real leader, daoxuan, is a genius expert that never came out in the world. What can I be afraid of if he is there? &quot;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu stepped forward and said in a sad voice, &ldquo;but the real leader has been seriously injured! &quot;</p>
<p>The old man was obviously shocked. He turned around and said, &ldquo;who can hurt daoxuan? &quot;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu was suddenly silent. Naturally he knew the murderer, but now he asked him to say the name of Taoist Cangsong. Somehow, it was a burst of sadness, as if he had said something, which was about to break with that man, but he didn&rsquo;t say anything for a while!</p>
<p>The old man then asked, &ldquo;daoxuan! How is he now? &quot;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu said, &ldquo;the real leader was seriously injured, but for some reason, he went into the magic moon cave. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Magic moon cave! &ldquo;The old man suddenly calmed down and surprised Lin for a while, but more like to himself, sighed,&rdquo; what are you afraid of, Qingyun sect? &quot;</p>
<p>Saying, the old man turns slowly again. Lin Jingyu lost his color and said, &ldquo;old master, do you see Qingyun in danger without saving? &quot;</p>
<p>The old man smiled sadly and said, &ldquo;young man, the Qingyun sect has been established for two thousand years. Can you know the strength inside! You can rest assured. &quot;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu did not know why. He was about to plead again. All of a sudden, he felt that the sword, which was originally quiet in his hand, was suddenly hot. As if he had been stimulated by something, the green light came on again.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu looked at the Dragon cutting sword in his hand, and suddenly felt it. He turned to the direction of the magic moon cave, and saw that between the mountains, a light rose from the sky, and the Dragon cutting sword in his hand seemed to scream low.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Born, finally! &quot;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know when I look at the old man there, with a complex expression of vicissitudes on my face, and I say in a low voice, &ldquo;my child, you are very lucky. You will soon see the legendary ancient sword killing the immortal! (to be continued. )</p>
