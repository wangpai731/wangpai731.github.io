      <p>Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s scalp was about to explode. His eyes were red and roared. A large number of Rune papers were taken out by him and pressed on his body. The protective light curtain outside his body suddenly increased, which was more than half a foot high.</p>
<p>At the moment when the light curtain appeared, the woman in red suddenly stepped out of the darkness on the side of Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s body and hit the light curtain.</p>
<p>A touch, the woman went deep into the light curtain three feet, but was blocked, unable to continue, the woman issued a sharp voice, the sound has penetrating power, making Bai Xiaochun deafening, a little confused.</p>
<p>He was shocked to bite his tongue. At the moment of waking up, he saw the woman in red turning into countless red beetles, trying to get into the protection from all directions.</p>
<p>But Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s protective layer was too thick. The red beetles couldn&rsquo;t penetrate the last seven inch protection with all their strength. They were suddenly bounced apart and gathered together in the air, forming the body of a woman in red.</p>
<p>She stares at Bai Xiaochun, giggles and pours again.</p>
<p>At the same time, bursts of whistling sound came from all around. The rockeries were wriggling one by one, and they stood up and became stone people. The fruit trees were shaking and growing hands and feet. They were pulled out from the ground and took big strides. They suddenly appeared from all around and rushed to the three people, especially the fruits on the fruit trees. At the moment, one by one, they were smiling again and continued to sing nursery rhymes.</p>
<p>One of the fruit trees, very close to Bai Xiaochun, was now following the woman in red and running straight to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Puppet!&rdquo; Du Ling Fei exclaimed.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s body trembled. He had never met this danger. His eyes were red at the moment. Seeing the woman coming again, he quickly pinched the formula and pointed to the woman with all his aura.</p>
<p>In an instant, his wooden sword flew out in a flash. The speed was as fast as a black lightning flash. It set off gusts of wind, and with a bang, it directly penetrated the woman&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>The woman screamed bitterly, and her body fell into countless red beetles. The beetles struggled and broke up on the way down.</p>
<p>The power of the wooden sword did not dissipate. This was Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s all-out attack under the crisis. After penetrating the woman&rsquo;s head, he went straight to the fruit tree man behind the woman.</p>
<p>In a flash, the fruit tree man&rsquo;s body was stunned and his head burst open. The fruit on it was shriveled and shriveled with naked eyes. Until death, he was still singing happily.</p>
<p>This scene makes Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s heart even more hairy. Fortunately, the power of the wooden sword is so strong that he is still galloping at the moment. He directly bumps into the wall on one side, making a loud noise. The wall is broken, and a huge hole appears. You can see a large number of stripes flying, such as whiskers, which seem to have to be woven again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rush out!&rdquo; Du Lingfei opened his mouth in a hurry. His body shook and went straight to the gap. However, Feng Yan was closest to the gap. He took out a black pill again and exploded it directly in front of the young people who were fighting with him. When the impact spread, he rushed out and went straight to the gap.</p>
<p>With a cry, he reached the gap and was about to rush out. However, Feng Yan&rsquo;s face changed suddenly. Two huge stone lions rushed in from the gap. He roared to the sky and killed Feng Yan and Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>These two stone lions are the stone lions guarding the gate before!</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t leave, lingxizong Damn it The young man who fought with Feng Yan, now his laughter echoed, his body shook and he entangled Feng Yan again.</p>
<p>Seeing that the gap was healing rapidly, Feng Yan roared and pinched his hands. At once, several fireballs the size of his head appeared outside his body, emitting high temperature and twisted edges, which exploded towards the surrounding area, forming a fire wave.</p>
<p>The stone lions were forced to retreat a little. As for the young people of the Luochen family, their faces changed. There were two fruit tree people who were blasted on their bodies, and one of them exploded directly.</p>
<p>The other is that when he retreats, Du Lingfei smashes his body with a sword.</p>
<p>The sound of the roar reverberated, and a large amount of green liquid was scattered from the bodies of the two fruit tree people. Actually, in their bodies, a dying figure was revealed, all of them were thin, as if they had been drained of most of their life.</p>
<p>One of them was in a coma, and the other barely opened his eyes. After seeing Du Lingfei, he was excited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Senior brother Hou!&rdquo; Du Lingfei exclaimed, recognizing that the other party was Hou Yunfei, and went forward to help Hou Yunfei up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Luochen family mutiny, escape quickly, and send a message to zongmen!&rdquo; Hou Yunfei is weak. He grabs Du Lingfei&rsquo;s arm and pours the last trace of spiritual power into his body.</p>
<p>Du Lingfei&rsquo;s aura suddenly rose outside. With a bite of her silver teeth, she suddenly rushed out with Hou Yunfei. Her speed increased sharply and went straight to the gap.</p>
<p>At one glance, Bai Xiaochun immediately recognized that this man was Hou Yunfei. His body shook and ran to the gap to avoid the coming stone lion.</p>
<p>At the moment, all three of them are galloping. Du Lingfei is the nearest to the gap. Feng Yan and Bai Xiaochun are behind. The distance is not far. Obviously, Bai Xiaochun is the fastest, even close to Du Lingfei.</p>
<p>Feng Yan&rsquo;s face was pale, and the fireball method consumed him a lot. After noticing Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s speed, his eyes flashed cold. When his right hand turned over, a black pill appeared again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sister Du, go away and bring the news to zongmen. I&rsquo;ll give you a hand!&rdquo; When his voice came out, the black pill of his right hand was thrown violently. The position was in the air between Du Lingfei and Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>With a bang, the pill suddenly exploded. The impact force pushed Du Lingfei faster again. Her whole body jumped up and slammed into the gap. It was like melting into the water.</p>
<p>However, Bai Xiaochun was blocked by the impact. She was stopped by a stone lion and her eyes were red.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Feng Yan!&rdquo; When Bai Xiaochun roared, the wind was howling around, and the stone lion came directly. Bai Xiaochun was about to dodge, but three fruit tree people were also nearby. The four puppets joined hands, and when Bai Xiaochun could not dodge, they directly bombarded him.</p>
<p>With a bang, the protective light of Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s whole body was immediately shattered after a few flashes. Even the blue light of the jade pendant was also broken in the gloom. Although it offset most of the external force, the stone lion was extraordinary, and the remaining force fell on Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s chest.</p>
<p>The huge impact force, makes Bai Xiaochun whole body a shock, the body is hit to fly out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Younger martial brother Bai&hellip;&rdquo; Feng Yan sneered at this scene, but his voice of heartache came out of his mouth. His speed did not decrease. In an instant, he was close to the gap, and half of his body was integrated into the water surface of the gap, and he was about to rush out. But at this time, the young man of the Luochen family suddenly made a sharp voice, and his body broke into pieces, turning into countless pieces of flesh without blood, and went straight to Feng Yan.</p>
<p>At the moment when Feng Yan was about to rush out, the flesh and blood suddenly approached, wrapping Feng Yan&rsquo;s body directly and tugging violently.</p>
<p>Feng Yan roared and was pulled away from the gap again. At the moment, there is not much left.</p>
<p>In his anxiety, he bit his teeth fiercely. He even bit the tip of his tongue and spat out blood, which landed on his flying sword. The flying sword turned red in the blink of an eye. It didn&rsquo;t cut anyone. Instead, it broke into pieces with a bang and turned into countless broken blades, and came straight to himself.</p>
<p>In this almost self mutilation way, he made countless broken blades penetrate through him. While hurting himself, he also successfully cut off the flesh and blood entangled in his body!</p>
<p>As soon as his body was loose, Feng Yan&rsquo;s body was covered with countless wounds, which made him dizzy. Fortunately, before those broken blades, under his control, he avoided his vital points. At the moment, he gritted his teeth and rushed to the gap in a flash.</p>
<p>At the same time, Bai Xiaochun was slapped in the chest by the stone lion, and his body fell back and screamed. However, the scream just came to an end. Bai Xiaochun blinked and looked down at her chest. She found that although her clothes were damaged and her fur coats were broken, she could I didn&rsquo;t feel pain.</p>
<p>He was surprised and quickly checked, and confirmed that It seems to be dangerous from myself to now, but in fact He didn&rsquo;t have a small wound all over his body.</p>
<p>Although the stone lion slapped him, he didn&rsquo;t feel much.</p>
<p>When he was surprised, the fruit tree people around him came after him and punched him in the back. Bai Xiaochun rushed forward and found that he still didn&rsquo;t feel it. Then he looked up and laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so strong, his grandmother&rsquo;s, then I&rsquo;m afraid of something.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun is full of energy. At the moment, she is full of confidence. With a whoosh, she goes straight to the gap. How fast she is, she seems to have to go too much faster. In the blink of an eye, she appears at the gap.</p>
<p>At the moment, half of Feng Yan&rsquo;s body has been stretched out. Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s speed is too fast for him to notice at all. In his opinion, Bai Xiaochun has just been bombarded by several puppets and died long ago.</p>
<p>Seeing that Feng Yan was going to leave, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s eyes showed a trace of hatred. His right hand suddenly lifted up, grabbed Feng Yanlu&rsquo;s shoulder outside and pulled it hard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can come out at last!&rdquo; At the moment, Feng Yan is in a surprise, but suddenly he has a pain in his shoulder. Before he reacts, the whole person is pulled back into the gap by a strong force.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No Feng Yan roared. Before he could see how he was pulled back, he first loosened the storage bag, and then the whole person was thrown away by the strong force, and his body was directly thrown away.</p>
<p>He just saw the figure of Bai Xiaochun at the gap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bai Xiaochun Feng Yan&rsquo;s eyes were red, but he was immediately surrounded by the two stone lions. His screams echoed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Senior brother Feng!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun made a heartbreaking sound. His body shook and stepped directly into the gap. At the moment when the gap was about to heal, the whole person went out.</p>
<p>Just as soon as he came out, the gap closed.</p>
<p>The exit is no longer in the house of the falling dust family, but outside the gate. Du Lingfei does not dare to stop after escaping. She waits anxiously at the edge of the jungle in the distance. From time to time, she looks around. At this moment, she sees Bai Xiaochun rush out. When she is about to call, she gives out a shrill voice and her eyes are red.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Senior brother Feng!! In order to save me, you not only gave me the storage bag, but also stopped those puppets yourself, elder martial brother Feng! &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bai Xiaochun, let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo; Hearing Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s words, Du Lingfei was sad in the bottom of her heart. Seeing the gap disappear, Bai Xiaochun was still there, crying out in a hurry.</p>
<p>With tears in her eyes, Bai Xiaochun ran to the forest and helped Hou Yunfei with Du Lingfei.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elder martial brother Feng is a good man&hellip;&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun looks sad and looks back from time to time.</p>
<p>Du Lingfei is bitter and astringent. She didn&rsquo;t expect that the task this time would be so dangerous. If she had followed Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s advice and didn&rsquo;t come to the Luochen family, maybe Feng Yan would not have died.</p>
<p>Especially when she saw Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s sad look that she could not beat her chest, she felt more sad and sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Younger martial brother Bai, we have to escape as soon as possible. The Luochen family will rebel. They won&rsquo;t let us send the news back to the sect. I have just tried. All fluctuations have been cut off here You can&rsquo;t use it any more. &quot; Du Lingfei looks at Bai Xiaochun and says in an astringent voice.</p>
<p>As soon as Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s body shook, he immediately realized the danger.</p>
