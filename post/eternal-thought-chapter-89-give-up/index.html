      <p>Almost at the moment when Bai Xiaochun looked up, beihanlie, one of the five Tianjiao on the north bank, suddenly gave a smile. He was already handsome. At the moment, such a smile made many of the young disciples on the south bank shine brilliantly.</p>
<p>With a smile on his face, he patted the ferocious and ferocious nocturnal beast lying beside him, and walked forward. The nocturnal beast&rsquo;s head shook, and his eyes showed a dark light, and he stood up.</p>
<p>At the moment when the big dog stood up, many people on the south bank immediately exclaimed.</p>
<p>The body of the nocturnal beast is more than ten feet tall when it stands up. It seems that it contains infinite force. Its head is huge. When its teeth are exposed, there is saliva flowing from the corners of its mouth. The black hair expands, which makes the big dog look more fierce.</p>
<p>In particular, its limbs are thicker than ordinary people&rsquo;s thighs. There are also bone spurs exposed. After a jump, it jumps to the battle platform and roars up to the sky.</p>
<p>The roar turned into sound waves and rolled in all directions, which made the fierce beasts around many disciples on the north bank tremble one by one, as if they had met the king, and they did not dare to look up.</p>
<p>With a smile, beihanlie stepped onto the battle platform, and his eyes swept over the people on the south bank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;North shore, north cold fierce, I don&rsquo;t know who is fighting with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As his words spread out, the big dog beside him dripped with cold and cruel light in his eyes. His teeth seemed to grow up with naked eyes at this moment. Anyone who saw such a fierce beast would lose the sense of war, especially its tongue sticking out and its ferocity was particularly obvious.</p>
<p>The people on the south bank are silent and look at the people who are not fighting, including Bai Xiaochun. Bai Xiaochun looks at beihanlie and the big dog. She turns her eyes and looks strange. She coughs and walks out.</p>
<p>As soon as he walked out, all the disciples on the south bank behind him gathered their eyes and showed their expectation. The huge nocturnal beast, now green eyes, is locking Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun put on a master&rsquo;s appearance, raised his chin and stepped onto the battle platform. In the distant sky, elder Zhou&rsquo;s bird seemed to pay attention to Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;South bank, Bai Xiaochun!&rdquo; On the stage, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s words just finished, that night beast suddenly roared, the cruelty in the eyes turned into a evil spirit that seemed to swallow Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bai Xiaochun? It&rsquo;s said that you are the first one in the south shore qualification war? &quot; The north cold Strong saw the white eye small pure body&rsquo;s dress up, in the eye does not conceal the ridicule.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your name is beihanlie, right? I&rsquo;ll give you a chance to admit defeat.&rdquo; Big dog&rsquo;s evil spirit looks white small pure heart crazy tremble, but his look still maintains the master&rsquo;s appearance, arrogant as the sky white clouds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give up?&rdquo; North cold strong smell speech a Leng, then look up to the sky laugh, seem to hear what is the most ridiculous joke, eyes gradually up evil spirit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s interesting that you are still the first outsider to dare to talk to me like this for so many years.&rdquo; The north cold strong right hand raises, pinches Jue is about to control the nocturnal beast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beihanlie, this is your last chance to admit defeat. Once Bai Xiaochun takes action, I am afraid. I advise you to It&rsquo;s better not to let me do it. &quot; Bai Xiaochun sighs, as if the world&rsquo;s best master, lonely world, see North Cold strong, showing a trace of sympathy.</p>
<p>At this time, all the people on the south bank were dumbfounded. They looked at Bai Xiaochun and looked at beihanlie, especially the fierce big dog. No matter how they compared them, it seemed that beihanlie was more powerful.</p>
<p>But Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s words, but let the south bank people can&rsquo;t help but raise some hope, can think of Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s past bad deeds, Nan&rsquo;an people are worried about gain and loss.</p>
<p>As for the north bank, there was a great deal of laughter and ridicule.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This guy is stupid. Elder martial brother Beihan is one of the five greatest pride in heaven. Although he is not as good as guiya, even if he is guiya, he still admits to his strength. Who is Bai Xiaochun? He is so arrogant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elder martial brother Beihan is not only strong in his own strength, but also admired by his night walking beast. He belongs to the king of beasts. His body is strong and powerful. A low roar can frighten the mind. Bai Xiaochun Thin and small, it is estimated that one bite will break the thigh! &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Senior brother Beihan, you will win</p>
<p>Beihanlie is amused by Bai Xiaochun. He has a flash of cold in his eyes. He has made up his mind to let Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s skin crack and lose his skin even if he doesn&rsquo;t die.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once I do, I&rsquo;m afraid.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun sighed. At the same time, his right hand suddenly patted the storage bag, and immediately there were two pills in his hand.</p>
<p>At the same time, beihanlie grins grimly, pinches a Jue, and immediately waits on the side of the impatient nocturnal beast, roars, and goes straight to Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>And the north cold strong here, also body a flash, speed is very fast, eyebrow Center Sun mark scattered light, rushed to Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>But at the moment when a man and a beast came, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s body speed increased sharply. In a flash, a pill popped up quickly and ran straight to the nocturnal beast.</p>
<p>In the eyes of the nocturnal beasts, the fierce light was shining. When they roared, they could easily avoid it, but their body was stunned and their expression changed. They didn&rsquo;t dodge and swallowed the pill directly.</p>
<p>After taking this pill, the dog&rsquo;s body trembled violently, and his eyes were filled with blood in an instant. There was a roar from all over his body. At this moment, his strong body swelled again and doubled in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>More spines, longer teeth!</p>
<p>His mouth is flowing down, especially between his legs. At the moment, there is a stick Stand up!</p>
<p>The whole body in this moment, extremely ferocious, indescribable.</p>
<p>His eyes were purple red, his clothes were coarse, and his mind seemed to be blurred. His claws scratched the ground, and he looked up to the sky and heard a strange roar. When the cry spread around, all the disciples outside the battle platform took a breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is What kind of pill is this</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something&rsquo;s wrong. How do I feel that this big dog looks familiar&hellip;&rdquo; The south bank disciple exclaimed.</p>
<p>On the other side of the north bank, everyone opened their eyes and watched the changes of the nocturnal beast after swallowing the pill. Obviously, they felt the momentum of the big dog, which increased in a terrible degree. Not only was the flesh more powerful, but even this kind of madness surprised many disciples on the North bank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This pill has such an effect</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can make the fierce beast mad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This scene surprised many people around him. Even beihanlie was stunned for a moment. He could not understand the situation. Although he obviously felt that the nocturnal beast was too powerful, he did not know why, but he always felt something bad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One more word of advice, admit defeat.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun raised his chin and spoke faintly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I intended to break your arm in this scene. Since you are playing tricks, I will break your limbs in this scene.&rdquo; In the eyes of beihanlie, evil spirit pervades. Although tianjiaozhan is not life-threatening, it is inevitable to break bones and tendons. At the moment, the body suddenly rushes out of his words and goes straight to Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun sighed and lifted his right hand. The female Xiangdan he refined went straight to the north.</p>
<p>Throwing out the pill, Bai Xiaochun is so fast that she quickly retreats to the edge of the battle platform and stands there, paying close attention to the northern cold.</p>
<p>Beihanlie&rsquo;s eyes contracted and was about to dodge. However, the pill broke down and exploded and turned into countless powders, which covered the whole area. No matter how beihanlie avoided it, he also got a lot of it on his body.</p>
<p>As soon as his complexion changed, he thought it was a poison pill. He stepped back quickly. However, he did not find any abnormality during the inspection. On the contrary, he had a strange smell, which was very pleasant.</p>
<p>He frowned and felt more and more strange. Just as he was about to make a quick decision, he suddenly heard a low roar coming from his side. His face changed greatly as soon as he swept the light.</p>
<p>The nocturnal beast, whistling, suddenly turned his head, dressed in coarse clothes, and showed a strong red light in his eyes. He was staring at beihanlie.</p>
<p>Beihanlie was startled. When he was about to control it, he roared with a loud voice. The nocturnal beast came straight to beihanlie. The speed was too fast for beihanlie to dodge, and he was directly knocked down by the nocturnal beast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn it, you&rsquo;re crazy!! What are you going to do? &quot; Beihanlie&rsquo;s face was gloomy. Just as he roared, he was immediately held down on his back by the big dog. This night&rsquo;s animal power is infinite. At the moment, he is crazy. He can&rsquo;t move. A bad premonition makes his face pale.</p>
<p>At this moment, all the disciples of the outer gate all moved forward involuntarily and looked at the scene with astonishment. Even those palm seats and elders on the terrace looked at it. Even the God consciousness of the supreme elder on the mountain top seemed to pay attention to.</p>
<p>Then, let everyone take a breath, even a scene of horror With a shrill cry from the north, it appears!</p>
<p>&ldquo;No No You!! Ah Beihanlie screamed and shocked the world. His expression was painful and his eyes were even more confused. He seemed to be unable to believe all these things. His whole body trembled and his voice was shrill to the extreme.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God!! What pill is this? It&rsquo;s not madness, it&rsquo;s hair Love</p>
<p>&ldquo;This This&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elder martial brother Bei was given by his own war beast Did you do it? &quot; All the disciples on the north bank roared with disbelief. Even most of the disciples were short of breath, and their eyes showed unprecedented panic and shock.</p>
<p>However, beihanlie&rsquo;s struggle at the moment has reached the point of madness. His screams continue to spread out, which is extremely miserable. This scene is earth shaking and has created the unprecedented precedent of Lingxi sect.</p>
<p>Even if it was ghost tooth, he was stunned at the moment. When he opened his eyes to see it, his body trembled, his eyes widened and his mind was incredible.</p>
<p>At the moment, all the disciples on the south bank felt that their minds were roaring, and even their thoughts were gone. Shangguan Tianyou was confused and felt that the whole world seemed to be bad. Zhou Xinqi&rsquo;s face turned red in an instant.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun, standing on the stage, was also frightened. This was his first attempt to use oestrus pill as a fighting method. He didn&rsquo;t expect to be so amazing At the moment, he couldn&rsquo;t bear to look at the miserable northern Han lie and sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve said that once I do, I&rsquo;m afraid, and I&rsquo;ve advised you many times, but you I&rsquo;m stubborn. &quot; Bai Xiaochun couldn&rsquo;t bear it. He was innocent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bai Xiaochun At this time, a roar came from the sky. Beihanlie&rsquo;s master, the whole person was very angry and roared. With his big sleeves rolled up, the night beast dog lying on beihanlie&rsquo;s body was rolled up directly and thrown out of the distance. He picked up the shameless beihanlie, and felt that he didn&rsquo;t want to stay here any more With a glance at Bai Xiaochun, she left quickly.</p>
<p>As for beihanlie, the physical trauma overlapped with the mental pain, which made him lose his consciousness when he closed his eyes. He didn&rsquo;t know how to see people in the future. The pain made him feel like a nightmare.</p>
