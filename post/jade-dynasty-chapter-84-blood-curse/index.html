      <p>The angry scolding finally subsided. FA Xiang doesn&rsquo;t care about other people at all, even the murderous dragon cutting sword in Lin Jingyu&rsquo;s hands doesn&rsquo;t look at it. His eyes only look at Zhang Xiaofan, which is not only worried, but also lamented.</p>
<p>When everyone was completely quiet, the Dharma phase slowly went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The murderer is my third martial uncle, a master of wisdom among the four great monks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as this speech came out, there was another stir, and everyone was completely shocked.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s body shakes for a while, and then shakes for a while. He can&rsquo;t feel anything. It seems that the whole sky has collapsed. But he is just a very funny and sad person</p>
<p>The sadness deeply engraved in the soul seems to be turned into a ghost at the moment, biting his heart hard!</p>
<p>After sorrow, what are you left with?</p>
<p>On the fire stick, it gradually brightened, with a slight blue light and a light gold, but all of this could not hide the cool red blood light. Never had such a strong ferocity, as if for thousands of years concentrated in the bloody breath of blood beads and soul absorption, accompanied by the despair of the countless spirits and ghosts roaring with anger, and poured into his chest at the same time!</p>
<p>In the chaos, the voice of the former method phase continued clearly: &ldquo;when martial uncle Puzhi came to Qingyun, he met the leader of daoxuan, and persuaded him to practice the two Buddhist and Taoist truths together, or he might be able to solve the mystery of eternal life, but he was politely rejected by the leader real person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tao Xuan Zheng for a while, then nodded:&rdquo; yes, there is this matter</p>
<p>FA Xiang continued: &ldquo;on that day, uncle Puzhi went down the mountain disappointed and walked to Caomiao village. Seeing that it was late, he stayed in the broken temple in the village at night. That night&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>His voice suddenly stopped, and there was no sound above the hall, except for Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s increasingly heavy breathing.</p>
<p>FA Xiangli manages his emotions and calms his mind, but his eyes are always on Zhang Xiaofan and he says: &ldquo;that night. Martial uncle Puzhi suddenly found that a man in black broke into Caomiao village at night and wanted to take the younger martial brother Lin Jingyu away. &quot;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu was stunned, and all the people immediately looked at him. Then he said to each other, &ldquo;martial uncle Puzhi immediately came to the rescue. Unexpectedly, the man in black has ulterior motives. On the surface, he seems to be abducting people. In fact, he is trying to deal with martial uncle Puzhi, intending to infect the evil things of the demon sect hidden in martial uncle Puzhi and eat blood beads! &quot;</p>
<p>Everyone was in a uproar.</p>
<p>FA Xiang said: &ldquo;the blood bead was accidentally found by martial uncle Puzhi in the Western swamp many years ago. In order that he would not harm the world any more, he sealed up the evil pearl with the Buddhist dharma. And use the treasure of Tianyin Temple &ldquo;Emerald beads&rdquo; to suppress. I just don&rsquo;t know how the mysterious man in black knew this. First of all, he hid a seven tailed centipede that was absolutely poisonous and hurt martial uncle Puzhi&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>Tian is not easily surprised: &ldquo;seven centipedes, is it Cangsong&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>This time, it&rsquo;s Lin Jingyu&rsquo;s turn to look more pale.</p>
<p>FA xiangdun then said: &ldquo;after that, martial uncle Puzhi fought with the man to death under the severe poison, and finally was seriously injured under the Qingyun gate&rdquo; magic sword against thunder &ldquo;which was put out by the man, and almost ran out of oil. However, he finally hit him with the&rdquo; great Brahma Prajna &ldquo;anti defeat, which made the man in black walk away. And in this fierce fight, Zhang Xiaofan, younger martial brother Zhang, also came to the Cao temple. &quot;</p>
<p>People in Qingyun gate. At the moment, how ugly his face would be if he wanted to see it hard, FA Xiang continued: &ldquo;later, uncle Puzhi knew he would die, but his lifelong wish has never been fulfilled, which is hard to reconcile. At this moment, he suddenly sprouted one, one A fanciful idea is to pass the supreme Mahayana Prajna Dharma of Tianyin temple to a disciple, and then let this young boy worship Qingyun to learn Qingyun Dharma. So the two dharmas of Buddhism and Taoism that never connect can be practiced on the same person at the same time. His lifelong wish has been fulfilled. &quot;</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan sneered and said: &ldquo;brother Puzhi is really good, and he has a lot of foresight. But I don&rsquo;t know why he didn&rsquo;t pass it on to Lin Jingyu, the better qualified one, but chose Zhang Xiaofan instead? &quot;</p>
<p>FA xiangdun said: &ldquo;martial uncle Puzhi thinks that younger martial brother Lin is very qualified. If you join the Qingyun sect, you will be noticed by the elders of the sect. I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s easy to see through, so&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>All the people in Qingyun gate looked at each other, and Tian could not easily shake his head and said: &ldquo;powerful, powerful&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>FA Xiang said: &ldquo;in this way, martial uncle Puzhi really likes younger martial brother Zhang&rsquo;s simple mind and geology, so he secretly passed the great Brahma Prajna, who has never been passed on from outside for thousands of years, to younger martial brother Zhang. Later, he was afraid that the blood bead would still be on himself. If the man in black turned back, he would inevitably fall into the hands of evil men, so he handed the blood bead to younger martial brother Zhang and asked him to find a cliff that no one knew to throw away, but,&rdquo; he said When he got here, he sighed and said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want younger martial brother Zhang to take this evil pearl all the time because of his old love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Above the hall, people solved a mystery. It turns out that the origin of blood eating beads is so, and so is the great Brahma Prajna Dharma of Zhang Xiaofan.</p>
<p>At the moment, there was a look of sadness on Faxiang&rsquo;s face, and he said slowly: &ldquo;if it had been like this, martial uncle Puzhi would have done nothing but recklessly. But no one expected that at this time, something happened Martial uncle Puzhi originally had a compassionate heart. He would rather suffer from the evil power of blood eating beads, but also control the evil thing with his own Buddhism. Unexpectedly, over the course of time, the evil power of blood eating beads has infiltrated into martial uncle Puzhi&rsquo;s soul. In normal times, martial uncle Puzhi has Buddhist dharma to protect his body, but he didn&rsquo;t realize it. But on that day, when he ran out of oil and ran out of light, he just left martial brother Zhang and other people, walked into the village, and suddenly remembered that even though he passed the Buddhist dharma to martial brother Zhang, he may not be able to worship Qingyun smoothly! &quot;</p>
<p>FA Xiang&rsquo;s face was miserable, and his voice trembled a little. He said: &ldquo;at this moment, martial uncle Puzhi&rsquo;s Buddhist power was greatly reduced, and he was attacked by evil forces. He thought of killing all the villagers in Caomiao village. Then Qingyun gate must include these two children in the orphans&rsquo; division, so&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; Lin Jingyu roared, and finally couldn&rsquo;t bear it. He cut the dragon sword and his body towards the Dharma phase. Tao Xuan said urgently, &ldquo;hurry, stop!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without waiting for his voice to fall, Tian can&rsquo;t wait to stop him. Lin Jingyu wept and cried. He was still struggling under the influence of Tian not easy and others. He hissed: &ldquo;I will kill you, kill you&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tianyin temple is led by Puhong and Pukong. All monks bow their heads, face ashamed, and chant the Buddha&rsquo;s name in a low voice.</p>
<p>Tao Xuan was silent for a long time, as if he had to think hard to digest this incredible truth. After a while, he suddenly said to the Dharma phase, &ldquo;just now you said that the general wisdom oil is dry. How do you know the truth of this matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Dharma phase was silent for a moment. &ldquo;Martial uncle Puzhi once made friends with a strange person and got a strange medicine&rdquo; three days death pill &ldquo;. If you take this medicine, no matter how serious your injury is, you will be able to arouse your full potential and save your life within three days. But three days later, even if the injury recovers, it will certainly die. Martial uncle Puzhi took this strange medicine and finally rushed back to Tianyin temple within three days. He explained the cause and effect to my mentor, master Puhong. I was in the service of eunuch teacher, and I heard about it.</p>
<p>Martial uncle Puzhi is now fully awake. He regrets that he planted the monstrous evil on that day. If he dies, he will not be compensated. He finally cries and sits down! &quot;</p>
<p>FA Xiang stared at Zhang Xiaofan deeply and said slowly: &ldquo;this is how things are. All these things. It&rsquo;s all the fault of martial uncle Puzhi of Tianyin temple. It has nothing to do with younger martial brother Zhang Xiaofan. Please don&rsquo;t blame him! &quot;</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan sighed a little and took a long breath. He was just about to speak. Suddenly, a low and miserable smile sounded on the quiet hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blame? Who is to blame me? &quot;</p>
<p>This laugh is strange and cold, with endless hatred, Zhang Xiaofan who has been lowering his head and gasping for breath. Slowly, slowly raised his head.</p>
<p>The red and bloody pair stared at the Dharma phase with a chilling cold.</p>
<p>FA Xiang frowned tightly and whispered, &ldquo;younger martial brother Zhang. You, you need to take care of yourself. Let him pass the past! The days ahead are long&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You! Go! Death! &quot;</p>
<p>Suddenly, Zhang Xiaofan spits out these three words from his teeth, and everyone looks pale. At this moment, Zhang Xiaofan seems to have become another person. He is full of murderous spirit, twisted and ferocious.</p>
<p>In the distance, Uncle Wang suddenly exclaimed again: &ldquo;ghost! Ghost! Another ghost! &quot;</p>
<p>And this time, his fingers are pointing at Zhang Xiaofan.</p>
<p>Everyone lost color. Master Puhong stood up in spite of his serious injury. Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s firebrand in his right hand was shining brightly. It was as if he had been reborn. It was full of blue light. It was mixed with the black gas of the magic wand. Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s face began to blur.</p>
<p>FA Xiang lost his voice and said: &ldquo;younger martial brother Zhang, lose that evil stick quickly. You have been invaded by evil force&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha ha ha ha ha&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan raised his head and smiled miserably. His voice was bleak: &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the right way? What justice? You&rsquo;ve always lied to me. I&rsquo;ve worked hard all my life to keep secrets for him even though I was dead, but what am I&hellip;&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>He opened his arms to the sky and roared, &ldquo;what am I -&rdquo;</p>
<p>The harsh voice, echoing between heaven and earth, is moving and tearful.</p>
<p>All the people in the field changed color. The Dharma phase flew up and said: &ldquo;younger martial brother Zhang, give up this thing quickly, or you will fall into the devil&rsquo;s way. There is no end to it&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan looked up at the sky, as if he didn&rsquo;t notice FA xiangchong coming. Everyone held their breath for a moment, and saw FA xiangwanted to catch the fire stick. Unexpectedly, a light came from the horizontal in the middle of the sky. FA xiangwas caught off guard, snorted in the middle of the air, and flew back.</p>
<p>Everyone was shocked, and saw a flash of green shadow. Biyao appeared in front of Zhang Xiaofan, facing countless righteous experts in front, but she was awe inspiring.</p>
<p>Her eyes were slightly red. She was obviously sad for Zhang Xiaofan. Regardless of other people, she turned around and grabbed Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s hand and said: &ldquo;Xiaofan, follow me, these beast like people are hurting you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan answers in a confused way, but the woman in front of him, somehow, is in the lonely moment of the world. The only thing he believes in is that he can&rsquo;t help grasping the gentle hand and following her!</p>
<p>However, how can the full hall of righteous experts allow them to be unrestrained? Especially a moment later, many people recognized that Bagao was the only daughter of the demon sect&rsquo;s leader, and immediately exploded.</p>
<p>Today, Qingyun gate has suffered countless deaths and injuries. Thanks to the demon sect, it&rsquo;s a bloody feud with the demon sect. In a moment, someone had blocked the way, and some people began to question whether Zhang Xiaofan was really related to the demon cult?</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi, Qi Hao and others lost their color. Tian linger and others tried to explain that Zhang Xiaofan was still fighting with the people of the demon sect, but the voice was so weak that it was drowned by the angry waves in an instant.</p>
<p>A moment later, the middle man on the main hall surrounded the two young men and women.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan stared at the blood red eyes, his body trembled slightly, and he couldn&rsquo;t stop laughing. I only think that the whole mind is full of bloody scenes, but it seems to be a blank at all. This life belief and belief have been completely destroyed today.</p>
<p>Biyao is much calmer than him. At the moment, I firmly hold Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s hand and stand with him, whispering: &ldquo;Xiaofan, don&rsquo;t be afraid, even if it is dead. I&rsquo;m with you, too! &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan shrugged, as if he was awake for a moment.</p>
<p>But at this time, a big drink came: &ldquo;who dares to harm my daughter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brush of one, ghost King figure appears on this jade clear temple, everybody is stunned, moment is mutinous.</p>
<p>After a while, the ghost King disciples, such as Qinglong and Youji, appeared one after another to surround Zhang Xiaofan and Biyao.</p>
<p>The ghost King took a look around him. At the moment, with the strength of the ghost King sect alone, it&rsquo;s true that there is a gap between the two groups, Qingyun sect and Tianyin temple. But he did not look afraid. He stood up and looked forward to it. He turned around and smiled at Biyao and said, &ldquo;Yaoer, you take Xiaofan first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biyao nodded and was about to take a step. However, how could Zhang Xiaofan succeed in such a way that the righteous people could not be seen? Besides, Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s status is very special at the moment, such as Qingyun sect and Tianyin temple. You can&rsquo;t let this man go anyway.</p>
<p>Tao Xuan said angrily, &ldquo;stop!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as he came out, he was surrounded by the righteous experts who could not bear it for a long time. In an instant, the broken Yuqing hall was in a group again, but the situation at the moment was completely reversed from that not long ago. It turns out that people in the right way besieged the ghost King clan.</p>
<p>After a while, the ghost King clan is in the downwind. Biyao still holds Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s hand tightly and looks around worried. However, the ghost king always smiles and looks at the situation.</p>
<p>People in the right path are under increasing pressure. Guiwangzong and other ten people have been pressed into a small circle, seeing the situation is in danger. Unexpectedly, at this time, outside the Yuqing hall, there was a sharp scream, and the strange light flashed in disorder. For a moment, the voice of tragedy was heard all the time.</p>
<p>In the right way, people were shocked. A moment later, they saw people flying. It was poison God, yuyangzi and sanmiaozi who led the other three demon sects to come to support them.</p>
<p>The masters of the demon sect joined in the battle one after another, and the situation reversed in an instant. Poison God slowly came to stand there, looking at their ghost king with a happy face, looking at the battle group in front, smiling on his face, but in his mouth he whispered: &ldquo;brother, you are cruel!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost King smiled and said, &ldquo;the old master is reckless and willing to take strange risks for my holy religion. In the future, his name will be handed down to the future generations of holy disciples.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The poison God smiled bitterly, stared at him, and scolded: &ldquo;fart!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the demon sect team arrived, Qingyun gate had already lost its vitality. Tian could not easily support them, but they had no choice but to be outnumbered. They were immediately pressed back, and the situation was gradually critical.</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan looked at the whole scene, his eyes were like shooting fire. In one day, the holy and inviolable Qingyun Mountain was killed by the people of these demon sects. It&rsquo;s a great shame since the establishment of Qingyun sect.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s more important is the current predicament. In this moment, he made up his mind and raised his arm.</p>
<p>At the moment, the four sects of the demon sect are still in the market. Their eyes are almost all on the immortal daoxuan. At first sight, they know that the old thief wants to kill and urge the immortal sword array again. How can he let him go? In a moment, the four figures shoot at immortal daoxuan.</p>
<p>At this time, as if summoned by something, the spirit beast water unicorn, which has been lying outside the Yuqing hall, suddenly roared and rushed in, with great momentum. In fact, the power of these ancient monsters is not inferior to that of any Taoist. It&rsquo;s not a joke that they were hit. The ghost king and others were stopped by them. In an instant, Shui Qilin rushed to Taoist immortal.</p>
<p>I saw it crawling beside immortal daoxuan, with a huge mouth, spitting out something, and immortal daoxuan reached for it.</p>
<p>The devil cult people were shocked. Looking around, they saw that it was indeed a long sword, but at the moment, it was totally lusterless. It seemed that it was cast by some strange stone, and the hilt of the sword body was a whole. It seemed that it was an ordinary stone sword, and there was a faint sight of the tattoo on the sword body. It seemed that it was a little shabby, and even a slight crack across the sword body.</p>
<p>It turns out that this ancient sword is like this, but it&rsquo;s hidden in the mouth of water unicorn, which no one can imagine.</p>
<p>A moment later, when the ancient sword of Zhuxian fell into the hands of immortal daoxuan, it suddenly changed and suddenly emerged from the ancient sword. In a moment, the huge Yuqing hall was completely shrouded by the unbelievable white light. Everyone was shocked and stopped one after another.</p>
<p>But in the light. But the body of immortal daoxuan shook again.</p>
<p>Ghost king and so on how to see experience, hardly need to say anything, immediately rush on together. Tian is not easy to be scolded, but it&rsquo;s too late to help. Unexpectedly, immortal daoxuan is weak. Right and left hold on to water unicorn, right hand hold the ancient sword of Zhuxian and wave forward. In an instant, white light rushes in like a huge wave. Poison God and other people work together to collide and make a big bang.</p>
<p>Originally half of the jade hall was broken. At the moment, even the remaining decadent walls and broken walls collapsed, and the dust was flying in the air. The ghost king and other people involuntarily took a step backward, and the four people&rsquo;s faces changed color. This ancient sword is powerful. It&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>But Rao is so. Immortal daoxuan is enveloped in the light of the ancient sword, but he pours out a big mouthful of blood. However, he is desperate to support the unicorn floating on the water. The water Unicorn roars and flies to the sky.</p>
<p>Between heaven and earth, all of a sudden, there is only the light of Zhuxian milliray, shining with bright light and becoming more and more prosperous. Accompanied by the sound of chanting spells, the brilliant Qi sword is incomparably colorful. It reappeared in the sky again, separating the monochromatic Qi sword continuously, and overflowing with light and color.</p>
<p>All the people in the demon sect lose their color, and the poisonous God stomps his foot hard. &ldquo;The power of this array is so great that we can&rsquo;t defeat the enemy. Let&rsquo;s go first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although the ghost king looked at the precarious appearance of immortal daoxuan, how could he not understand that this man was seriously injured and was about to die, how could he still urge such a costly array of heaven shaking Dharma? But since the array is launched, its power is very important. After all, he didn&rsquo;t dare to gamble on the life of the disciples of the demon sect. He sighed a long time, flew up and motioned for the disciples to retreat.</p>
<p>Biyao pulls Zhang Xiaofan and wants to fly away. Suddenly, the figure flashes in front of her. It&rsquo;s Lu Xueqi who stands in front of her, and the Tianya magic sword in her hand is shining with blue light. Lu Xueqi said in a cold voice, &ldquo;younger martial brother Zhang is under my Qingyun sect. Please let him go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>How can Biyao let it go? She said angrily, &ldquo;I will leave him to you to kill? You can kill me first! &quot;</p>
<p>After that, he didn&rsquo;t have much to say. Sad flower hit in the air.</p>
<p>At this moment, the sword array of killing immortals has been shrouded in the top of Tongtian peak, and the world is gradually dark down. Some people in the ghost King sect saw that Biyao and Lu Xueqi were fighting together, and they immediately turned back to help, and the right way here also made a mess.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s heart was full of pain. He felt a fierce thought howling in his mind, a terrible but tempting sense of destruction that would kill countless human lives.</p>
<p>The fire stick seems to follow the owner&rsquo;s mind. The red, green and gold lights rotate, but obviously, the red light is more and more abundant.</p>
<p>The Dharma phase watched in a hurry. Since kongsang mountain saw Zhang Xiaofan that day, because of that secret, he looked at Zhang Xiaofan differently. At the moment, he didn&rsquo;t want to see Zhang Xiaofan fall into the devil&rsquo;s way in any case, and he grabbed the fire stick in Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s hand as soon as he flashed.</p>
<p>Biyao is in a hurry, but Lu Xueqi and other people have to shout: &ldquo;Xiaofan, be careful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, Zhang Xiaofan seemed to hear nothing. He let the FA Xiang grasp the fire stick.</p>
<p>FA Xiang was very happy, but his face suddenly changed a lot after a while. He only felt that the ferocity on the fire stick was like the tide. Zhang Xiaofan, who was honest and plain, suddenly smiled like a devil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; FA Xiang shouts loudly and miserably. Zhang Xiaofan hits him on the chest with a fire stick and sprays blood on his mouth.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan looks up at the sky and roars, his eyes are red. He joins the battle group and grabs Biyao. The red light of the fire staff is very bright, as if it is also revelry, laughing wildly with the master to fight for death and blood.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi and others have retreated, no matter what, they are still unable to make full use of Zhang Xiaofan. But now Zhang Xiaofan seems to have completely fallen into madness, with infinite hatred in his eyes. All his moves take people&rsquo;s lives, and in a moment, he has forced everyone back.</p>
<p>Biyao is very happy. She pulls Zhang Xiaofan and says, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two of them soared to the outside of the temple.</p>
<p>At this moment, the sky is full of Qi swords like mountains and seas. The sword array has launched an attack on the devil cult and others. This time, it seems that immortal daoxuan has also escaped. Not only is the sky full of sword rain falling fiercely, but the huge seven color main sword in the sky is also manipulated by the invisible magic force, rushing down with the momentum of breaking the sky and the earth.</p>
<p>The main sword of this array is equal in power. Take it with one sword. In an instant, within the range of several meters, nearly ten people were scared without shouting. Even Yu Wei could not avoid him. Even his left hand was cut off by Sheng Sheng. He cried out miserably. His body was shaped like an electric sharp point and ran through the air.</p>
<p>At the same time, the immortal daoxuan in the sky is exhausted and his body is askew. Almost fell off the water unicorn, and it was hard to support. He looked down and saw that for a while, most of the people of the demon sect had fled, but a few were still on the top of Tongtian peak, and the last one, Zhang Xiaofan, was led by Biyao.</p>
<p>In the middle of the sky, daoxuan has seen Zhang Xiaofan fall into the devil&rsquo;s way. Just now, he has been fighting with FA Xiang, Lu Xueqi and others. The hand is ruthless, and the look is crazy at the moment. Obviously, it can&rsquo;t be ignored.</p>
<p>However, this person has two real dharmas: Qingyun gate and Tianyin temple. There are more evil things in his hands. If he let the tiger go back to the mountain, he is afraid of the future killing, which is far better than the ordinary people of demon sect.</p>
<p>Daoxuan sighed in his heart, but his mind had been decided in this moment. Even if they are talked about by people all over the world in the future, they must not leave behind this mortal disaster.</p>
<p>At present, immortal daoxuan puts together the final power.</p>
<p>In an instant, all the colorful Qi swords in the sky shine together, especially the seven color main swords of the array, which are more impressive and half bigger, roar and ring. Shake the heaven and earth, like the rage of the ancient god of heaven, rush down, straight to Zhang Xiaofan!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; Not to mention that the people in the demon sect lose color, they are the people in the right way. People in Tianyin temple and Qingyun gate all change color, and Tian and Su Ru are not easy to be pale. Tian ling&rsquo;er screamed and fainted.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Lu Xueqi holds Tianya&rsquo;s magic sword tightly, his face is bloodless, and Tianya in his hand is trembling slightly.</p>
<p>It was a huge sword. Before it reached the ground, there was a loud cackle. Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s ground broke and the wind howled, covering him. It was a fatal situation.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s eyes were red, covered with invisible sword Qi, and he could not get rid of it. His heart was filled with grief and hatred. He watched the huge horror sword in the sky falling down with boundless killing intent and opened his mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The voice vibrated all over the world, and the heaven and earth changed color. But the immortal sword seemed to be the merciless thing to kill the god Buddha. It still attacked him without any feeling. Seeing Zhang Xiaofan was about to become the ghost under the sword, it was smashed to pieces.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the heaven and earth suddenly quieted down, and even the earth shaking power of Zhuxian sword array held its breath for a moment</p>
<p>The gentle and white hand that had been familiar in the years appeared beside Zhang Xiaofan, with the faint and clear bell sound, pushing him aside.</p>
<p>It seems that the sound of sleeping for thousands of years is quietly heard at this moment, for the sake of beloved love, softly singing:</p>
<p>Nine hell spirits, gods and demons of the heavens, sacrifice my blood body</p>
<p>She stood in the fierce wind and looked at Zhang Xiaofan with reddish eyes. Her white face seemed to have a faint smile.</p>
<p>The wind blew her green clothes, hunting and dancing, like the most miserable scenery in the world.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s heart sank.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, he opened his mouth and shouted loudly, but was forced back by the wind; he jumped up to Bagao in a crazy way, but was opened by the mysterious breath, red tears flowed from his blood red eyes, and ran across his cheek.</p>
<p>The woman in the wind opens her arms to the sword rain in the sky and to the giant sword that seizes the power of the heaven and the earth.</p>
<p>…… Three lives and seven lives, falling into hell forever. It&rsquo;s just because of love, though I don&rsquo;t regret it</p>
<p>The fierce wind suddenly turned its direction and turned into a huge whirlpool around Baguio. The graceful and beautiful woman was pushed up in the air by the wind to welcome the colorful moving giant sword.</p>
<p>She was the only glory in the world at that moment!</p>
<p>For a moment</p>
<p>Countless blood color mists erupted from her body instantly, forming a crystal red blood wall in front of her body. At the same time, on her white face, nine faint light smoke came out and integrated into the blood wall.</p>
<p>The blood wall immediately boils, like the burning of the hot fire of infatuation, with all the enthusiasm and desperation burning, burst out the unparalleled brilliant brilliance, against the sky!</p>
<p>And that Zhuxian master sword, crash!</p>
<p>The brilliance is so dazzling that no one can open his eyes.</p>
<p>The indescribable roar shook the whole sky. The unstoppable Zhuxian sword flew back, and the Qi sword was in disorder. On the top of Tongtian peak, there are huge earthquakes and flying rocks. There are many huge cracks on the mountain, as if the end is coming.</p>
<p>Vaguely, a slim and sad figure. Falling slowly from the air.</p>
<p>Between heaven and earth, suddenly all quiet down, only a voice, tear heart crack lung general roar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Endless darkness. Shrouded in the whole world, he trembled in the dark, dare not move, dare not face, dare not wake up!</p>
<p>But. He woke up after all!</p>
<p>Shaking hands, slowly clench, then release, slowly, open eyes, as if, also need all his courage.</p>
<p>A common stone room with simple and simple decoration. He got out of bed slowly. He didn&rsquo;t dare to think of anything. He even put the fire stick at hand. He didn&rsquo;t look at it again, as if he was under any guidance. He went to the door and walked out slowly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a long passage outside. Many people are busy and quiet, but no matter who they are, when they see him, they immediately step aside and lower their heads.</p>
<p>He walked in a daze as if a voice were calling him. cracking. And he came to a corner, where there was a great stone chamber, and the door was open, at the other end of the corner. There came a familiar voice, which seemed to be the tone of a man named Qinglong in my memory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. ghost, you are the most amazing person in the world. Please see in the face of the virgin Ming Wang, save&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a sigh, a low voice in the dark said: &ldquo;the emperor of the ghost is kind to me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that I don&rsquo;t try my best, but what miss Biyao uses is the most tragic &ldquo;blood poison curse&rdquo; in my holy religion, which is the infatuation charm we have passed down since ancient times. The spirit almost leave the body in horror and soul, fling caution to the winds, and then it will be a force against the sky. But the person who uses this curse will never be able to survive. I really can not help it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. ghost, but&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The voice cut off: &ldquo;I know what you&rsquo;re going to say. It&rsquo;s true that at that moment, the Qibao &ldquo;Huan bell&rdquo; on miss Biyao forced the three spirits and seven spirits out of her to capture the remaining one and guard in the bell body, so the body of miss Biyao could not be destroyed. But, but this kind of soul returning skill has long been lost for thousands of years. Only thousands of years ago in the evil land of Southern Xinjiang, a flash in the pan Black Witch clan heard of this magic, but it has also long been extinct. There is nothing I can do about it! &quot;</p>
<p>The green dragon was dumb, and then said: &ldquo;but the Lord didn&rsquo;t eat or drink for several days, and now Mr. ghost, he always respects you. Please advise him! &quot;</p>
<p>The voice said slowly: &ldquo;the Lord of the ghost is too sad. It will get better after a long time&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Qinglong wanted to say something else. Suddenly, he felt as if he had found something. He turned his head and looked there. He saw the weak and pale figure. He walked to the door step by step. Then he seemed to summon up the greatest courage and finally walked in.</p>
<p>No more sound.</p>
<p>The blue dragon bowed his head and sighed in the dark.</p>
<p>In the stone room, on the white jade platform, the beautiful woman lies there quietly, as if sleeping quietly. Her father, sitting next to her, took her hand and looked at her like this.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan stared at her, silently shed tears, her legs were soft, and finally she could not hold on any longer, and sat down beside her.</p>
<p>That gentle and quiet face has become an indelible mark in his life memory!</p>
<p>In the silent stone room, there is a faint voice of sobs, a soft voice choking:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why are you so stupid I haven&rsquo;t told you that you are the person I saw in that ancient well&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>Qingyunshan.</p>
<p>Xiaozhufeng.</p>
<p>The night is deep.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi stood silently on the mountain and looked into the distance, but saw the cold night and the stars shining all over the sky, as if sneering at the common people struggling in the world.</p>
<p>The footsteps rang, and her familiar and respectful master&rsquo;s voice rang behind her: &ldquo;Qi&rsquo;er, why are you standing here again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi didn&rsquo;t speak.</p>
<p>Shuiyue looks at her, sighs suddenly, walks to her side, whispers: &ldquo;you think of that person again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi was silent, and suddenly there was pain on her face. She said, &ldquo;master, it shouldn&rsquo;t have been like this. It wouldn&rsquo;t have been like this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The water moon seemed to be silent, and after a while she said softly, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s all life, Qi&rsquo;er. When you see him again in the future, you will be the enemy of the world, and you should remember clearly. &quot;</p>
<p>Then she sighed and turned away.</p>
<p>Only Lu Xueqi was left standing on the spot alone. The mountain wind blew. She felt a chill on her body. She looked at the distance in silence and said in a low voice: &ldquo;when I meet him again&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The night is as cold as water, shining on her lonely figure. (to be continued. )</p>
