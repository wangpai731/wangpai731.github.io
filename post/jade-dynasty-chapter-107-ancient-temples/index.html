      <p>The evil land in the south of the vast land of Shenzhou is said to be rich in poisonous insects and beasts. The most obvious boundary between the Central Plains and the Central Plains is in the extreme south. Suddenly, it rises like a flat land. The tall and lofty mountains are connected one by one, towering into the clouds and separating the north and the south.</p>
<p>Since ancient times, few people in the rich land of the Central Plains have gone to the south of Xinjiang for no other reason. The first reason is that the road is steep, the second reason is that there are too many beasts, poisonous insects and miasma, and the land is too poor to cultivate. Later, I don&rsquo;t know when it began to spread in the endless mountains of Southern Xinjiang. There are all kinds of barbaric and alien races. They are cruel and easy to kill. Among them, there are more horrifying orcs who are raw and cannibal. Since then, no one dares to go. Instead, the world is horrified. Day and night, they are worried about whether those alien races will run out of those mountains, invade the Central Plains and be in danger Harm the world.</p>
<p>However, there is no rumor that barbarians have harmed people for thousands of years. Although occasionally in the border areas of the south, there have been a few cases of strange and alien monsters from time to time, most of them died of nothing and were gradually forgotten by people. Today, even the people living in the southern border probably only say &ldquo;if they don&rsquo;t obey the words, those barbarian monsters will come to catch you&rdquo; when their mother coaxes their children to sleep at night. In ordinary times, no one will think about whether these alien groups in the mountains really exist, let alone the Central Plains far away.</p>
<p>In other words, the one hundred thousand mountains covered by layers of mists are now forgotten by people all over the world.</p>
<p>However, ordinary people all over the world have forgotten about these different races, but some people who practice Taoism have not. No matter the righteous and evil evil evil families, as long as they are older, they will know that in the past thousand years, the reason why the southern ethnic groups can&rsquo;t harm the world is that the &ldquo;burning incense Valley&rdquo; of the righteous giant sect has made great contributions.</p>
<p>The towering mountains cut off the communication between the north and the south. The people of the Central Plains can&rsquo;t go down to the south, and the barbarians can&rsquo;t go up to the north. But a thousand years ago, an incredible thunderstorm came from the sky. There are countless people killed and injured in a thousand miles. After the Holocaust, it was found that in the lofty mountains, Tianlei&rsquo;s huge force had to split the mountain somewhere. It revealed a dark path only three feet wide.</p>
<p>That is to say, from that time on, among the hundreds of thousands of mountains in the world, there are strange people of the barbarian nationality, who invade the people from time to time, and the people in the border area suffer terribly.</p>
<p>Until the emergence of burning incense valley.</p>
<p>The origin of the burning incense Valley is the most mysterious among all the schools of the right way. As early as 1500 years ago, there were disciples of this line walking around the world. If we only talk about the origin, there are only Qingyun sect and demon sect in the world with a longer history than burning incense Valley, even Tianyin temple is not as good as it.</p>
<p>But in spite of this, this group was extremely low-key in the past. Although there will be several highly skilled people from time to time, they have little influence on the situation in the world. Until 800 years ago. This group found a valley near the dark tunnel in the southern border area and settled down. Since then, it has called itself &ldquo;burning incense Valley&rdquo;. In the past 800 years, there have been a large number of incredible experts with growing power. Now, it has fought against Qingyun gate and Tianyin temple, becoming one of the three major schools in the world.</p>
<p>Correspondingly, Yun Yilan, the contemporary Valley master of the burning incense Valley, is also a giant of the right way, who is as famous as the immortal xuanren of Qingyun gate and Puhong of Tianyin temple, but he is always low-key. On the one hand, fame is not as good as the above two.</p>
<p>Because of the geographical relationship, the burning incense Valley almost instinctively took care of the dark path called &ldquo;black hole&rdquo; in the local area. Since then, there have been no rumors of barbarian monsters harassing the people. So in the hearts of the local people. Burning incense Valley enjoys a high reputation and is honored as the first-class immortal.</p>
<p>These materials are recorded in the ghost King sect of the demon cult. Guili has seen them in the past ten years, and now he slowly turns them out in his mind. Now it is the third day after he inquired about the news about the mermaid monster on Monday. He hurried all the way up and down, and finally arrived near the 100000 mountain.</p>
<p>The night is deep. On this night, the moon was in the sky. The clouds were thick and there were few stars. But the moon was clear and shining on the earth, and the mountain where he lived was very bright.</p>
<p>GUI Li stood on the hill and looked south, frowning slightly. Monkey Xiaohui is still lying on his shoulder, with a wild fruit picked from nowhere in his hand, eating it with relish.</p>
<p>In the first two days of this journey, he still found the mark left by his subordinates, but today, the killing monk has completely lost the news. However, according to the information he left a few days ago, the killing monk, who is good at tracking, has determined that the mysterious fish people are going south rapidly, and the goal is obviously to return to the old nest in South Xinjiang.</p>
<p>Is killing already in conflict with those mysterious fishmen?</p>
<p>The ghost Li slightly sighed, and there was a trace of worry in his eyes.</p>
<p>The barbarians in southern Xinjiang are quite different from those in the Central Plains, which has been mentioned many times in the remaining records of the ghost King clan. The people there don&rsquo;t know anything about cultivation, but they seem to have all kinds of weird witchcraft and strange methods.</p>
<p>The killing monk is not long-lived and has a short temper, but he is really an outstanding figure among the new generation of disciples of the ghost King clan. He is a powerful man who follows the ghost in his daily life.</p>
<p>This mysterious disappearance is a little worried. But at the moment he looked ahead, only to see the dark night, the dark shadow in the South pupil, it seems that there are some giant things in the night, I think it is the legendary one hundred thousand mountains. And somewhere under that mountain range is the legendary and mysterious burning incense valley.</p>
<p>The southern border area has always been the area of influence of the burning incense valley. The disciples of the demon sect enter alone, which is dangerous.</p>
<p>When he was meditating, he suddenly felt something, looked up at the sky, and saw a solitary moon in the sky, shuttling between the light black clouds, as if suddenly, there were some demons.</p>
<p>A dark red light suddenly appeared in the night sky. Under the bright moonlight, it flied across the sky, towards a mountain in the south, and fell down.</p>
<p>The ghostly eyes stared at the strange red light, and their eyebrows began to wrinkle gradually. After a moment, they seemed to make up their minds, clapped the little gray on their shoulders, and then the blue light came back at their feet, and the ghost was shining with a faint light. Holding him and the little gray up slowly, they accelerated their speed suddenly and chased the red light.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know when the night sky will start. There will be more black clouds. The light of the lonely moon in the sky will gradually fade. It seems that there is a kind of peculiar dark and strange atmosphere in southern Xinjiang. It becomes more and more strong this night.</p>
<p>The mysterious red light flew for a while and fell down in a mountain ten miles south from the mountain where GUI Li was hiding. There are many mountains in the south of Xinjiang. There are many plants on the mountain, but there is a desolate ancient temple in the forest of this nameless hill. The red light fell in front of the ancient temple, and a flash of light shook. A thin old man appeared.</p>
<p>He looked around for a few times, and after he was sure there was no one, he went into the ancient temple.</p>
<p>Wild mountains and mountains, wild ancient temples, but some people come here late at night. Of course, there are hidden things. A moment later, in the shadow of the forest outside the ancient temple, the ghostly figure slowly appeared. His eyes looked at the nameless ancient temple and then looked up to the sky. The dark clouds were heavier in the night sky, gradually covering the moon.</p>
<p>His figure swayed and quietly swept to the ancient temple.</p>
<p>Obviously, this ancient temple has been in disuse for a long time. There are many ruins in the temple. Even in the main hall, from the outside, it is extremely damaged and full of holes. The night wind blows cold. The broken window creaks and shakes, the low voice looks particularly desolate in the night, and there is a hint of strangeness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boo!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a slight noise. It seemed that someone had lit the fire. A little weak light was lit up in the main hall. However, the light was dim, which could only light up a little bit in the main hall. A little farther away, it was still shrouded in darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jiji, Jiji, Jiji, Jiji&hellip;&rdquo; Suddenly, a strange and inexplicable voice suddenly sounded in the hall. It sounds like crying in the middle of the night, and like a poisonous insect walking at night. It makes people feel numb and uncomfortable after listening to the time.</p>
<p>Ghost and fierce hide in the dark. Quietly look into the hall.</p>
<p>However, in the dim light of the main hall, in addition to the old man I saw just now, there were two other people, one in his thirties, of medium height, and the other. He was quite tall, but somehow, he was tightly wrapped by a cloak all over his body, and even his head didn&rsquo;t show a point, and the strange and inexplicable voice came from the bottom of the cloak.</p>
<p>The voice echoed in the dark ancient temple, and became more and more monstrous, as if the evil spirits were waking up.</p>
<p>He was also the first time to hear such strange words. Naturally, he didn&rsquo;t know the meaning of them, but seeing the other two people&rsquo;s looks, he knew there would be results. Sure enough, the mysterious man said for a while, stopped for a while, and the middle-aged man who stood beside him and listened attentively turned his head and said to the old man: &ldquo;the patriarch said: this time, it&rsquo;s useless, but it&rsquo;s not allowed for you to break our hands and expose our hiding. When the king of the beast heard about it, he lost his temper&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>When the middle-aged man said the word &ldquo;beast God&rdquo;, his voice suddenly became low, and the tall figure wrapped in the cloak seemed to shake for a while.</p>
<p>The old man also frowned and said, &ldquo;we agreed to tell the king of the beast where the&rdquo; God of heaven and hell stone &ldquo;is. As far as we know, the strange stone is indeed in the God of heaven&rsquo;s treasure house in the dead water, but how can we blame our inaccurate information?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at the mysterious figure under the cloak, and suddenly there was a hint of ridicule on his lips. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you can&rsquo;t do it yourself,&rdquo; he said</p>
<p>As soon as this remark came out, the mysterious man wrapped in the cloak said: &ldquo;Jiji, Jiji, Jiji&hellip;&rdquo; This strange voice came out one after another. Although the ghost and Li, who were hiding on one side, didn&rsquo;t understand its meaning, they listened to it quickly and sharply. Obviously, the mysterious figure was angry.</p>
<p>The mysterious man &ldquo;jijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijiji 。”</p>
<p>As soon as the old man saw that the middle-aged man seemed to have finished speaking, he couldn&rsquo;t help being stunned. Just now the mysterious man had said it for a long time. When the middle-aged man translated it, he only had this sentence. I think the middle-aged man had many curses and curses. The middle-aged man didn&rsquo;t want to translate.</p>
<p>The old man pondered for a moment. It seemed that he didn&rsquo;t want to fight with the mysterious man. He said: &ldquo;this time, the treasure house of the emperor of heaven came out. It&rsquo;s a great omen. It shakes the world. It&rsquo;s not for us to control if we want to hear the news from those middle earth cultivation experts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mysterious man wrapped in the cloak was still angry, and there was another strange sound. The middle-aged man listened attentively, nodded frequently, and then said to the old man: &ldquo;the patriarch said: the God of heaven and hell stone is very important to the king of the beast God, and it matters a lot. This time, the king of the beast God returned without success. He was furious, and killed several people on the spot&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man heard this. His face was heavy, as if he was in a heavy mood, but his eyes were still full of sarcasm.</p>
<p>The man in the middle continued to translate and said, &ldquo;so please quickly find out who is the owner of this gem, so that they can go and get it for the king of the beast God again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost Li that hides in the side suddenly moves in the heart. Listen to them several times mentioned the thing of the emperor of heaven and the stone of the underworld. Is it the strange stone swallowed by the ash?</p>
<p>At this time, I saw the old man meditate for a moment, and then nodded: &ldquo;OK, this matter will be covered in us, within three days.</p>
<p>We will give you an answer. &quot;</p>
<p>The mysterious man snorted, &ldquo;jijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijijiji</p>
<p>The old man nodded his head to say something, but the mysterious man turned around and walked out without looking at them at all. Arrogance and rudeness.</p>
<p>As soon as the old man&rsquo;s face changed, he looked at the mysterious man&rsquo;s back and scowled. The middle-aged man quickly pulled him and shook his head. The old man took a look at him, which made him bear it.</p>
<p>When the mysterious man&rsquo;s tall figure disappeared in the dark, the old man suddenly &ldquo;Pooh&rdquo; and scolded: &ldquo;what, a group of animals!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The middle-aged man said with a smile: &ldquo;martial uncle, don&rsquo;t get angry with me. Don&rsquo;t get along with them. '</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care about them,&rdquo; the old man said with a sneer, turning his head and looking at him. Sun Tu, you have lived among those animals for three years and studied their bird songs. Are you afraid of suffering a lot? &quot;</p>
<p>The middle-aged man named sun Tu smiled and said: &ldquo;I am very grateful to the valley master and all the martial uncles for my poor qualifications. It&rsquo;s a chance. I dare not do my best! &quot;</p>
<p>Suddenly, the ghost heard the word &ldquo;Valley master&rdquo;, and his heart was filled with awe.</p>
<p>The martial uncle smiled and seemed to be very approbated. He reached out and patted sun Tu on the shoulder. Suddenly he sneered: &ldquo;fortunately, the valley master knows that I&rsquo;m always calm, so he sent me to meet these beasts. If the old man who was appointed by the superior officer comes, he can&rsquo;t do anything wrong on the spot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sun Tu made a dry smile, and his face looked strange. He responded with a smile, but he didn&rsquo;t dare to take the official policy behind him.</p>
<p>There is no doubt about the ghost Li on one side at the moment. Shangguan is one of the top figures in the &ldquo;burning incense Valley&rdquo; in the south. Although he has never walked in the world, he has a long reputation. Especially in the first battle of Qingyun ten years ago, the king of ghosts used more ingenious tactics to send Zhou Yin to disguise himself as a superior official to plot against the monks of Tianyin temple. As expected, he succeeded in one stroke, almost killing Qingyun and Tianyin. At that time, Guili was a Qingyun disciple named Zhang Xiaofan. He was in the middle of the field, and naturally was impressed by the name.</p>
<p>Listen to the two people&rsquo;s voices calling the mysterious man to be a &ldquo;beast&rdquo;. Just now, the identity of the mysterious man seems to be coming out. It&rsquo;s just the chain of burning incense Valley, which has always been just and awe inspiring. At the moment, it reveals an incredible evil spirit.</p>
<p>In the dark, there was a cold and contemptuous sneer on the corner of the mouth.</p>
<p>In the field, the two men discussed a few more words. Sun Tu blew out the candles in the main hall, and they went out. It seemed that they wanted to leave here. Ghost Li frowned in the dark, was meditating, suddenly, from outside the ancient temple came a strange roar!</p>
<p>All the people in the ancient temple were shocked. The old man and sun Tu stopped at the same time.</p>
<p>The voice was shrill and angry, and there seemed to be a bit of panic in it, but it seemed to be the roar of some beast, not the roar of human beings. It&rsquo;s just that the ghost makes a little argument. It seems that the voice was made by the mysterious figure just wrapped in the cloak, and his eyebrows are wrinkled. At the same time, the old man and sun Tu also heard it, and their faces suddenly changed. At the same time, they soared to the outside of the temple.</p>
<p>Deep mountains and wild mountains, there are even ambushes!</p>
<p>The moonlight is cold, as if the color of the supernatural is heavier.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Beyond the ancient temple, behind a hill in the distance.</p>
<p>A purple awn, blooming in the night, rushed to the sky, and then split.</p>
<p>Far away from tens of feet away, the spirit even felt that a trace of cold evil spirit. His eyes narrowed, and in a moment he recognized what magic weapon it was.</p>
<p>The two of them flew to the burning incense Valley, but the old man&rsquo;s Taoism was obviously much higher than that of suntu. In a short time, they pulled suntu down a few feet. At the same time, they had a dark red fairy sword in their hands and flew to the shining purple light.</p>
<p>But before he could fly to the back of the hill, he heard a loud roar, echoing in the dark night with despair. The old man&rsquo;s face changed a lot and his feet became more urgent. The shout had already passed. He followed him in the other direction and around the back of the hill.</p>
<p>A smell of blood came on the face. The Cape, which was split into two parts, slowly drifted down from the middle of the air, and the dark red blood splashed everywhere. The mysterious figure who showed his real body was indeed a fish head man, but at this moment, he was split into two parts by life, and the body fell to the ground, but the murderer had disappeared.</p>
<p>The old man was shocked and angry. The murderer killed people in an instant and then disappeared. This Taoist practice is very important. Although he thought the fishermen were very unhappy, he knew that the valley master had a big deal to discuss with these barbarians. This time, they were killed by someone under their own eyes. In case they were investigated there, it would be hard for him to explain.</p>
<p>At this time, sun Tu also rushed to the scene to see the bloody image in his eyes, and was stunned.</p>
<p>The old man&rsquo;s face was so ugly that he suddenly jumped up. The dark red light was under his feet. He flew into the air and looked around, but he saw only four darkness and a vast forest. Where could he find the murderer?</p>
<p>Suddenly, he cried out, &ldquo;who is the high man here? Please come out and see me. Burning incense Valley Lvshun asks for advice!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The voice spread far away. A moment later, there was a faint echo in the forest mountain. Everywhere was &ldquo;Lu Shun asked for advice Lu Shun asked&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>But in addition, there is no sound.</p>
<p>If Lu Shun&rsquo;s eyes were to burst out fire, he fell to the ground a moment later and said to sun Tuji, &ldquo;clean up the patriarch&rsquo;s body and take it back to the valley. The murderer will be nearby soon. I will dig three feet and find him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sun Tu nodded quickly and said, &ldquo;be careful, martial uncle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The night is cold and the moon is covered with black clouds.</p>
<p>Although it&rsquo;s only a short time, the ancient temple suddenly seems to be gloomy and dark. Only the moonlight from the black clouds occasionally can light up some places, but it turns to darkness a moment later.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are really powerful, young master. I can&rsquo;t hide it from Lvshun, but I can&rsquo;t hide it from you!&rdquo;</p>
