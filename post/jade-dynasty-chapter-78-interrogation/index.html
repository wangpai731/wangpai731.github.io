      <p>After crossing the threshold, a solemn and solemn air suddenly came to you. The most sacred place in Qingyun gate is still as magnificent and amazing as before.</p>
<p>There are many people standing and sitting on the huge hall, but somehow, what Zhang Xiaofan saw at the first sight was not these people, but in the deepest part of the hall, he saw the Sanqing God in the shadow so far away.</p>
<p>In front of the main hall, the candles were burning silently, and the wisps of smoke were flying.</p>
<p>In the middle of the main hall and above the main seat, immortal daoxuan, who is highly respected and has the spirit of crane bone and immortal wind, sits there. Beside his seat, there is a small tea table. On the table top, there is Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s magic weapon fire stick.</p>
<p>The row on his right side is the first of all the veins of Qingyun gate. All the people, including Tian Jianyi, are sitting there. The elders and disciples of the other branches of Qingyun gate, either sitting or standing, are behind them. As for Qi Hao, Lin Jingyu and others they are familiar with, Lu Xueqi is standing silently behind master Shuiyue, beside Wen Min, who is adored by song Daren, and staring at Zhang Xiaofan.</p>
<p>On the left side of immortal daoxuan, there are many people Zhang Xiaofan has never seen. There are good-looking monks and gloomy old people. Zhang Xiaofan glanced away and saw only a few familiar faces in that group. Among them, the FA Xiang and FA Shan of Tianyin temple were also there. They all stood respectfully behind an old monk sitting at the top. It seems that this kind-hearted old monk is mostly the God monk of Tianyin temple.</p>
<p>Chang Jian took song Daren, Zhang Xiaofan and Tian linger to walk over and saluted Taoist Xuan, saying, &ldquo;master, elder martial brother Zhang of dazhufeng has arrived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The people around moved and their eyes moved. Not only Zhang Xiaofan, but song Daren and Tian linger were not at ease.</p>
<p>Su Ru, sitting next to Tian uneasy, frowned and said to them, &ldquo;come here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren and others are relieved, and should come over, just at this time. Taoist Cangsong, sitting on the top of the field, suddenly coughed.</p>
<p>Tian was not easy to move his muscles on his face, and his eyes were slightly twitching, but he finally said coldly: &ldquo;seven, you are standing there. Headmaster immortal and all predecessors have something to ask you. &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s steps just started seem to bump into a wall. Sheng Sheng stops and whispers, &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren looks at Tian linger and looks at Zhang Xiaofan. There are worries in my eyes, but I finally know that it&rsquo;s not the time, so I have to walk to Tian and stand behind him.</p>
<p>Taoist Xuan looked down without expression. He saw a young man standing alone between the crowds on both sides, with slight tension and fear in his eyes. Even his hands clenched tightly.</p>
<p>Is this really the ordinary orphan in Caomiao village?</p>
<p>He sighed deep in his heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zhang Xiaofan.&rdquo; Immortal daoxuan called slowly.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s body seemed to tremble slightly, and he knelt down slowly. In a low voice, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan looked at him and said: &ldquo;these elders beside me are all high people in my righteous way. This time they are also here for you. This is Puhong, the leader of Tianyin temple. Next to him is Pukong, the God monk of Tianyin temple, and the official of burning incense Valley&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan can&rsquo;t lose his courtesy. Naturally, he will tell all the famous names behind him, but Zhang Xiaofan doesn&rsquo;t have the heart to listen. For a while, his eyes fell on the two amiable old monks sitting in the front, the red monk robe with gold pasted on it. White eyebrows are like snow. They are also looking at him at the moment.</p>
<p>Puhong God monk ranks the first of the four God monks in Tianyin temple. In the world, he has always been one of the three great people in line with the immortal daoxuan of Qingyun gate and the leader of burning incense valley. The status is far beyond the comparison of others. It&rsquo;s even more difficult for ordinary practitioners to see him, but this time they unexpectedly broke the example of a hundred years, and were shocked to reach Qingyun Mountain.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s surprise, it&rsquo;s Qingyun gate who got the news. It can be seen how much Tianyin Temple attaches importance to the unexpected &ldquo;great Brahma Prajna&rdquo; external transmission of Dharma!</p>
<p>Above the hall, immortal daoxuan&rsquo;s voice stopped at some time. There was a silence. Everyone&rsquo;s eyes were fixed on the figure kneeling on the ground.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan slowly lowered his head and looked at the green bricks in front of him. Suddenly he thought to himself: were these monks the same as the general intellect?</p>
<p>In the distance, the fire stick lying quietly on the tea table beside immortal daoxuan seems to feel the master&rsquo;s mind, and there is a light flash of blue light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zhang Xiaofan,&rdquo; said immortal daoxuan slowly, &ldquo;now I ask you a few things, and you should answer honestly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan whispered, &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a while, immortal daoxuan seemed to ponder the sentence, and slowly said: &ldquo;during this trip to Liubo mountain in the East China Sea, some Taoist friends of Tianyin Temple pointed out that the Taoist method you used when you were fighting with Kui Niu, a strange beast, was the&rdquo; great Brahma Prajna &ldquo;true method that was never spread out of Tianyin temple. Can it happen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan didn&rsquo;t speak. Suddenly, the atmosphere in Yuqing hall seemed slightly tense. Tian turns his head uneasily, only to find that all the people stare at Zhang Xiaofan in silence.</p>
<p>In the air, there seems to be something invisible beating gently.</p>
<p>For a while, Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s voice slowly said, &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>All of a sudden, there was an uproar in the main hall. Although this answer had been expected for a long time, after Zhang Xiaofan said it, the monks in Tianyin temple were still excited. Only Puhong and Pukong, who were sitting in front of them, including the Dharma phase standing behind them, had no change in their faces and were silent.</p>
<p>But here in Qingyun gate, Tian&rsquo;s face is more and more ugly, and Tian linger&rsquo;s face is also very pale. In a dismay, only Lu Xueqi looked at the silent figure and said nothing.</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan frowned and glanced slightly at the monk Puhong of Tianyin temple. However, in the excitement of all the disciples, the man slowly closed his eyes and put them out clearly that he would not open his mouth for the time being.</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan snorted coldly in his heart, turned to Zhang Xiaofan, raised his hand and signaled to the noisy people to be quiet.</p>
<p>After all, his identity is very important. Soon, no matter under the Qingyun gate or other figures of all schools, they all calmed down. They only heard the immortal daoxuan slowly saying, &ldquo;besides, someone said, this fire stick in your hand,&rdquo; he said. He reached out and picked up the black stick, and continued: &ldquo;there are evil things of the demon cult eating blood beads, but really?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another silence, Zhang Xiaofan low way: &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This time. The crowd unexpectedly remained silent. Blood eating bead, the word full of bloody evil, will appear on a disciple of Qingyun sect!</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan&rsquo;s face gradually darkened and said, &ldquo;do you have anything to say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although I have already thought of facing today&rsquo;s situation. But Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s heart is still blank at the moment. His fear of unknown punishment makes his body tremble a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me, me, me&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>As if in the sea despairing but still desperately struggling boat, he blankly said simple words, but did not know what he wanted to say?</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan&rsquo;s face was grim, and he said, &ldquo;how did this blood bead come from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the end of the voice suddenly raised, the tone became sharp, Zhang Xiaofan was drunk by him, a buzz in his mind. Suddenly there was a confusion, and finally he began to speak. At the beginning, the following words naturally followed: I was teased by monkey ash when I was a child, and then I chased Tian ling&rsquo;er to the back mountain valley with Tian ling&rsquo;er. Blood eating beads and black strange sticks suddenly fought each other, and finally changed into this shape</p>
<p>On the main hall, people looked at each other, even immortal daoxuan, Puhong and Pukong, including the senior officer of the burning incense Valley, frowned. The melting of blood beads and soul taking blood as the medium. For the first time, they have heard that the world is so great that there are no surprises.</p>
<p>People may have doubts. There are many of them, but Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s eyes are slightly dull and his expression is lost, but it&rsquo;s not like lying.</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan pondered for a moment, then looked at Zhang Xiaofan and said, &ldquo;OK. I believe in your accidental melting, but before that, the blood bead has already been on you. How can you have such evil things, a little child? What&rsquo;s more, the blood bead always sucks the essence blood of living things, but then it&rsquo;s not melted with Dementor. How can you be safe? &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan is speechless. The real reason for this is that Puzhi temporarily banned the blood eating beads with the Buddhist dharma. On that day, Puzhi also told him to find a lonely cliff and throw it away, but Zhang Xiaofan himself collected the beads as a memorial.</p>
<p>At the moment, to say universal wisdom is to say everything. However, this is what Zhang Xiaofan is deeply reluctant to say.</p>
<p>The kind old monk and himself had only one night&rsquo;s predestination. He only called him &ldquo;master&rdquo; when he was running out of oil and the light was dry. But for many years, he could not forget the man anyway.</p>
<p>In an instant, it seemed that the eyes and voices of the people around had become so far away, and the scenery seemed to return to many years ago. Facing the old monk himself, the little boy said to him stubbornly and firmly, &ldquo;I know, I will not die!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t say die!</p>
<p>Death doesn&rsquo;t say Death doesn&rsquo;t say Death doesn&rsquo;t say</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A big drink, the sound shakes four times, but it is not easy for Tian to frown, stand up angrily, scared everyone. I saw his face was grim, but the color of worry in his eyes was more and more serious. What Zhang Xiaofan had admitted at the moment was that he had violated the Qingyun gate and the right way and taboo. If he followed the common sense, he was afraid that he would not die.</p>
<p>Tian is not easy to be shocked and angry, but it seems that the little apprentice doesn&rsquo;t know that his life is at stake, especially that the people of Tianyin temple and burning incense valley are here. Qingyun gate has the intention to maintain it, and there is no way to do it. If he goes on like this, I&rsquo;m afraid that Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s life is really hard to protect!</p>
<p>But Zhang Xiaofan is like a villain at the moment. He slowly lowers his head and doesn&rsquo;t say a word. Other people forget it. Su Ru and other people in dazhufeng watch him grow up. They all lose their color for a while. Zhang Xiaofan is always silent and tough. At this critical moment, it seems that he doesn&rsquo;t even say anything.</p>
<p>Tian is not easy to take a step, but before he can say what to do, the chairman of Tianyin temple, Puhong, who has been silent, suddenly opens his eyes and says, &ldquo;if you have something to discuss, please don&rsquo;t move.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian is not easy to be shocked. I didn&rsquo;t expect that the master Puhong would suddenly speak for Zhang Xiaofan. But the monk Puhong is so virtuous and respected that even he is the first member of Qingyun sect, he dare not disrespect his meaning. At present, he has to hum and sit back.</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan glanced at Puhong lightly and frowned slightly, as if he had some thoughts. Then he said to Zhang Xiaofan, &ldquo;there is more. Where did you learn the great Brahma Prajna Dharma? &quot;</p>
<p>As soon as this statement was made, people immediately became nervous, which was the key. The secret current of the private bottom of the two main factions of today&rsquo;s right way is vaguely affected. This answer must be a rock breaking surprise!</p>
<p>But Zhang Xiaofan, still kneeling in silence, did not say a word for a long time.</p>
<p>Tao Xuan&rsquo;s pupil contracts.</p>
<p>Coldly said: &ldquo;you are not from the truth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the beginning to the end, I have been looking at Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s Dharma phase. Suddenly, I lowered my head and stopped looking at him. That is Puhong Pukong sitting in front of him. At the moment, I also look at him. There is a flicker of light in my eyes. I don&rsquo;t know what I want?</p>
<p>The world around us is silent, but it seems to have turned into a huge invisible wall and sandwiched itself in the middle. It&rsquo;s squeezing cold.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan slowly felt out of breath, but he still didn&rsquo;t speak.</p>
<p>Maybe even he doesn&rsquo;t know what he is insisting on?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bang!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a loud sound, everyone was surprised. Zhang Xiaofan looked up, but he saw that it was immortal daoxuan who slapped the fire stick on the tea table. He suddenly stood up and frowned. Obviously moved the true anger, shouted: &ldquo;evil! Don&rsquo;t think you don&rsquo;t talk, I can&rsquo;t help you! &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan shivered and his face was extremely complicated. But after all, there was no opening.</p>
<p>Tao Xuan was more angry, and he was extremely angry. He said: &ldquo;OK, OK, OK, you are such a sin. Today I will let you&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master, calm down!&rdquo;</p>
<p>All of a sudden, a shout came from the disciples of Qingyun sect. Suddenly, there was a stir in Qingyun sect, and everyone lost their color. Immortal daoxuan has been sitting in Qingyun for a hundred years. No one has ever dared to stand in his way. Unexpectedly, someone dares to stop him today. At this time, even Zhang Xiaofan looks around.</p>
<p>In an uproar, Lu Xueqi was suddenly out of the crowd, walked to the middle, stood beside Zhang Xiaofan, and knelt down.</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan was stunned for a while. Master Shuiyue was also surprised. He stood up and said: &ldquo;Qi&rsquo;er, are you crazy? Come back! &quot;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s face was a little pale, but she knelt beside Zhang Xiaofan. She didn&rsquo;t flinch at all. On the beautiful face, her white teeth gently bit the light lower lip and said quietly, &ldquo;master, little Zhufeng disciple Lu Xueqi, have something to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shuiyue frowned and said, &ldquo;Qi&rsquo;er, Zhang Xiaofan is a disciple of dazhufeng. He has made a serious crime. The leader has his own decision. Don&rsquo;t be talkative. Come back quickly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s mouth seemed to twitch. Zhang Xiaofan beside her clearly heard her sudden heavy breath. Obviously, in front of all the people, she knelt beside him at this moment. The pressure was absolutely extraordinary.</p>
<p>However, in this solemn and solemn hall, in the eyes of all strangers, the beautiful woman still did not retreat.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know when the mountain wind outside the Yuqing hall blows in.</p>
<p>She swept up a few threads of her hair and fluttered gently.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan stares at the woman beside him without speaking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master, please allow me to say something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan took a look around him, only to see those Taoist friends of other sects look one after another, so he said coldly, &ldquo;OK, you can say it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi nodded: &ldquo;thank you very much, leader. Headmaster, martial uncles, I have no close relationship with younger martial brother Zhang Xiaofan, but I also went down the mountain with him after the seven pulse martial arts meeting. I saw younger martial brother Zhang fighting with the rest of the evil cult in the Wanfu ancient cave of kongsang mountain and Liubo mountain of the East China Sea. It was not the evil cult traitor. At this moment, there are outsiders. Younger martial brother Zhang may have a hard time hiding. Please think twice and don&rsquo;t&hellip;&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly, a voice interrupted Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s words. Everyone saw that he was sitting under the two monks of Tianyin temple, the senior official of burning incense valley. Just now, Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s attention was focused on the two monks of Tianyin temple, but he didn&rsquo;t pay attention to him. At the moment, he was thin and tall, and even his words were sharp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most of the outsiders that this girl said were me, as well as brother Puhong, brother Pukong and all the others? Hey hey, Qingyun gate has such a thing. Thanks to you, you still live in the world. Don&rsquo;t even let us see the explanation? &quot;</p>
<p>The face of immortal daoxuan and other elders of the first lineage suddenly became ugly. Taoist Cangsong sitting next to him said coldly, &ldquo;brother shangguance, since our leader decided to have a public trial of this person in front of you today, it&rsquo;s just to give you an account!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The superior officer made a sneer and said in a Yin voice: &ldquo;Taoist Cangsong, your disciple of Qingyun sect, Zhang Xiaofan, has too much hidden feelings, except for the evil things of the demon sect. Even the non fax method of Tianyin temple can&rsquo;t be separated from the XuanHuo Jian, the supreme artifact of our incense valley. &quot; At this point, he paused and turned to immortal daoxuan. &ldquo;I put my words first. Xuanhuojian is the most precious treasure of burning incense Valley, but we must find it back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian is not easy to hear more and more angry, sneer, way: &ldquo;Shangguan Taoist brother.</p>
<p>Since this treasure is so important, why don&rsquo;t you look forward to burning incense Valley? If you throw it around casually, you will have a relationship with my apprentice? So, you who guard the treasure, are you just a waste? &quot;</p>
<p>Shangguance is furious. He stands up quickly. Tian is not easy to show his weakness. He also stands up. The atmosphere in the field is suddenly tense to the point of tension.</p>
<p>Daoxuan said, &ldquo;brother Tian. What do you do? Sit down! &quot;</p>
<p>Tian could not easily glare at the superior officer&rsquo;s advice, but he did not dare to disobey the leader in public, so he had to sit down slowly. Daoxuan turned to Shangguan and said, &ldquo;brother Shangguan, naturally we will give you an explanation. You can rest assured.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The superior officer made a sneer and sat back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Qi&rsquo;er, you are not back!&rdquo; said the water moon</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, Lu Xueqi, who was obedient and obedient to his master, looked up to daoxuan and said, &ldquo;master, no matter what mistakes Zhang made. Please check carefully, but he is not the traitor who sneaks into our Qingyun sect! &quot;</p>
<p>She looked at the front, her face still, as if she had no fear of the whole world. Determined way: &ldquo;disciple Lu Xueqi, is willing to guarantee with the life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everyone was shocked for a moment!</p>
<p>Even Zhang Xiaofan himself opened his mouth slightly and looked at the woman kneeling with him, on the white skin and in the face of ice cream, suddenly. There seems to be a faint tenderness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Disciple Lin Jingyu is willing to guarantee Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Almost at the same time that Lu Xueqi said this, Lin Jingyu couldn&rsquo;t bear it any longer. He rushed out and knelt on the main hall without seeing his master, Taoist Cangsong, suddenly turning into a pig liver like face. He said in a loud voice: &ldquo;younger martial brother Zhang, for the sake of Qingyun&rsquo;s life and death, will never be a traitor. I grew up with him and know nothing about it. Please head martial uncle Think twice! &quot;</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan&rsquo;s face is more ugly at the moment, but it seems to be stimulated at the moment. There is a sudden commotion among the disciples of Qingyun. In a moment, the wind returns to the disciples under the gate of Fengfeng, the disciples under the gate of longshoufeng and the disciples under the gate of dazhufeng. At the same time, someone runs out, kneels down together, and says loudly: &ldquo;I would like to guarantee my life for younger martial brother Zhang!&rdquo;</p>
<p>All of them lost their color. Looking at them, they were Zeng Shushu, Qi Hao and Tian linger. At the moment, apart from Tian uneasy couple, Taoist Cangsong, the first Taoist in Longshou peak, and Zeng Shuchang, the first in Fenghui peak, all stood up and were shocked.</p>
<p>At this moment, the situation in the hall is in chaos. Immortal daoxuan is very angry. Do these disobedient disciples want to rebel today? However, at this time, many of the righteous are in the same way and can not attack. He, the leader of Qingyun sect, really lost his face. His anger went straight to his chest, but he didn&rsquo;t know what to do at once?</p>
<p>At this time, I heard only a slight cough behind me, but it was Xiao Yicai, his disciple, who said in a soft voice, &ldquo;master, do you want to go back to have a rest and deal with it later?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan immediately woke up, snorted heavily and slapped the table. Suddenly, a confused Qingyun disciple calmed down and looked at this place.</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan walked towards the inner hall without saying a word, and everyone looked at each other. Only Xiaoyi smiled and stood out and said to the people, &ldquo;well, there was an urgent matter in Houshan just now. Please wait a moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The superior officer said with sarcasm: &ldquo;martial nephew Xiao, I&rsquo;ve heard that the rules of your Qingyun sect are very big. It&rsquo;s really extraordinary when I see you today!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai&rsquo;s eyes flashed with anger, but then he said with a smile, &ldquo;you are joking.&rdquo; Then he turned around, coughed gently, and went to Taoist Cangsong and other heads of the blood. He whispered, &ldquo;you martial uncles, don&rsquo;t you want them to get up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In response, Zeng Shuchang and others immediately called back their disciples and took them to one side to scold them severely. Tian ling&rsquo;er is pulled back by Su Ru, but she doesn&rsquo;t get scolded. Instead, she is full of grievances. There are tears in her eyes, and she cries: &ldquo;Niang&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru sighs and shakes her head to stop. Tian ling&rsquo;er can&rsquo;t see Tian easily, but he can&rsquo;t see Tian&rsquo;s face is iron green, his eyebrows are locked, he doesn&rsquo;t say a word, and sits on the chair in a muffled voice.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi is pulled out of the Yuqing hall by her senior sister Wen Minqiang. The eyes of the people around her are full of strange looks. Until they get to a quiet corner outside the Yuqing hall, Wen Min complains in a low voice, but Lu Xueqi lowers her head and says nothing.</p>
<p>After a while, master Shuiyue came slowly.</p>
<p>After all, Wen Min cherished her younger martial sister and went up. She said to Shuiyue in a low voice, trying to explain, but Shuiyue&rsquo;s face was solemn and went straight to Lu Xueqi.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi did not dare to look at her. She lowered her head and whispered, &ldquo;master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shuiyue stared at her, the most proud and beautiful disciple of her. She didn&rsquo;t speak for a long time, and then suddenly sighed. The voice was helpless, as if it was still a little sad.</p>
<p>Wen Min and Lu Xueqi were surprised at the same time.</p>
<p>Shuiyue looks away from Lu Xueqi, goes to the railing outside the Yuqing hall, looks out, but sees the peak into the sky, the white clouds are floating, a kind of Fairy Spirit is awe inspiring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kiel, you did something wrong today, you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi lowered her head and said softly, &ldquo;yes, master, I&rsquo;ve embarrassed you. It&rsquo;s the fault of my disciples. But Zhang Xiaofan is not&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>Shuiyue suddenly looks back at her and says, &ldquo;why do you guarantee his life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s face suddenly paled, unable to speak.</p>
<p>Shuiyue looked at her for a long time, shook his head and sighed, &ldquo;injustice!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi whispered, &ldquo;master, I am not&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The water moon suddenly cut off: &ldquo;do you know that I just said you did something wrong, not that you let me down?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi and Wen Min were surprised. Wen Min said, &ldquo;master, what do you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shuiyue smiled bitterly and looked into the distance again, as if she also fell into a long memory: &ldquo;you young people, don&rsquo;t know the height of the earth, show off your courage for a while, just afraid to push Zhang Xiaofan to death!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s face faded and lost her voice. &ldquo;Master?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shuiyue&rsquo;s voice gradually sank, as if he saw the past buried in his memory: &ldquo;for many years, it&rsquo;s almost a hundred years in a flash! At that time, there was a man who made a big mistake like him, but we and we were desperate to plead for him, but finally&hellip;&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>She looked back slowly, met the eyes of Lu Xueqi and Wen Min, and said softly: &ldquo;although the situation of that person was different from that of Zhang Xiaofan today, the situation was very similar. But that man has always been the most hated person of your headmaster and uncle! &quot;</p>
<p>The water moon spoke in a low, even painful way. For the first time in her life, she appeared sad in front of her disciples. (to be continued. )</p>
