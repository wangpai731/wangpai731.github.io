      <p>The night was deep.</p>
<p>The wild dog Taoist, who has entered the hell&rsquo;s gate but is lucky to be pulled back, has been bandaged up several wounds on his body at the moment. It seems that he is still weak, but lying on the ground, his breath is weak but gentle, and he is no longer worried about his life.</p>
<p>Xiao Huan, who saved the wild dog Taoist priest, is also in a coma at the moment, but she is just exerting too much energy, which is not a big problem. This is understood in the hearts of the other two sober people, but there is not much worry.</p>
<p>For Monday immortal, what he is concerned about or on guard at the moment is the mysterious man who has just rescued Xiaohuan. At the moment, he had recognized the mysterious man in black. He was not a stranger. He had seen him not long ago. It was in Heyang city at the foot of Qingyun Mountain that the mysterious man in the villa met him again today.</p>
<p>Monday fairy sat beside her granddaughter Xiaohuan, her eyes floating to the black figure standing with negative hands from time to time. From his experience, he naturally knew that this man&rsquo;s practice on the side door and strange skill of ghost road was very important, but he seemed to be an enemy and not a friend on that day. He didn&rsquo;t expect that the man in black would rescue Xiaohuan today. Fortunately, when we met each other last time, it was lucky that the three immortals escaped on Monday. At this time, although the man in black had no idea of his origin, his three lives were really in his mind.</p>
<p>Zhou Yixian thought to himself that the man in black, who was the ghost man who had been tracking the ghost down the south, seemed to have a plan in mind, but he hesitated in his heart. It is a big violation of his usual style to save people. However, his practice of ghost way has always been a strange and vicious evil trick in the eyes of the world. It is unique in addition to the three true dharma sects of Taoism, Buddhism and magic and the witchcraft of Southern Xinjiang. However, in fact, it has always been a bad reputation for the evil cult. Almost all the people in the ghost road continue quietly in a kind of darkness. However, it is a difference that Mr. GUI can get the courtesy of the ghost king, the patriarch of the demon sect, and there are other reasons.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why. Although the origin of the mysterious ghost road continues to this day, but the number of people is extremely thin, no one can say when it will be cut off incense. Think about it, normal people, I&rsquo;m afraid that not many people will think of practicing this kind of weird skill that deals with the world of ghosts all day long.</p>
<p>Mr. ghost has practiced for many years.</p>
<p>The high level of Tao is the world&rsquo;s first-class and first-class characters. In the same vein of ghost Road, no one can reach it. He has always been hard-working, which is also the result of practicing the ghost road and strange skills. Unexpectedly, he suddenly saw that Xiaohuan, at a young age, showed a very high and profound soul collecting skill in the ghost road. This was a great shock. First, he was shocked by Xiaohuan, a young and beautiful woman, who was on the same line of ghost road. It seems that he has an incredible talent. What&rsquo;s more shocking is that although this magic art is a secret method of ghost Road, it has been lost for many years. He is the great master and expert of ghost and strange arts. However, Xiao Huan has made it. How can he not be shocked?</p>
<p>When Xiaohuan forcibly recovers the soul, although Mr. ghost doesn&rsquo;t know how to collect the soul, he has a unique insight into the ghost road. At a glance, he can see that although Xiaohuan is gifted, he is too demanding after all. After a while, Xiaohuan is unexpectedly able to catch the soul of Taoist wild dog among countless ghosts. But it has already infuriated countless evil spirits, and was devoured by ghost Qi. When he was about to die, somehow, Mr. ghost couldn&rsquo;t sit back and ignore it. Finally, he helped.</p>
<p>Although he can&rsquo;t collect the soul magic, but deal with these ordinary ghosts. However, it is more than enough. Once you do it, you will immediately urge the Dharma array to protect the small ring, and let the small ring&rsquo;s soul collecting magic skill be completed. However, after the incident, he hesitated and didn&rsquo;t know what to do next.</p>
<p>The atmosphere in the field, for a moment, was so embarrassed. After a long time, Xiao Huan moved, but she finally woke up and called softly in her mouth: &ldquo;grandfather.&rdquo; Then I opened my eyes.</p>
<p>On Monday, Xian was overjoyed and quickly lifted Xiaohuan up. Xiaohuan&rsquo;s face was tired and her body was weak, but it didn&rsquo;t hurt much. After calming down, she immediately turned her head to see the wild dog Taoist. She saw the wild dog lying on the ground. Although the wound was serious, her breathing was slow. It was obvious that she had really turned around and Xiaohuan was smiling.</p>
<p>She turned her eyes and found that there was a man in black around her. She couldn&rsquo;t help being stunned. Then she recognized that this man was the mysterious man in black in Heyang city that day. She could not help but shrink and said, &ldquo;grandfather, why is he here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Monday immortal helped Xiaohuan to stand up and said in a low voice, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how he came here all of a sudden. But just now, when you cast your magic, it was he who helped you and the wild dog to turn the corner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Huan thought of this at the last moment. After all, he was bitten by the ghost because he didn&rsquo;t practice enough. When he saw that he was going to end up with ten thousand ghosts devouring his heart, the array in his hand suddenly became powerful and drove away all the ghosts around him. It seems that all of them were saved by the mysterious man in black.</p>
<p>Think of here, small ring to ghost Mr. place slowly nodded, way: &ldquo;thank you this elder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost seemed to turn a blind eye to Xiao Huan&rsquo;s thanks, but suddenly he asked in a cold voice: &ldquo;little girl, I have a few things to ask you. I hope you can answer me truthfully.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan was stunned. At the same time, she felt that the hand of Zhouxian holding her body gently pulled her. She hesitated for a moment. Finally, she said, &ldquo;what do you want to say, please ask?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost nodded and said, &ldquo;the art of ghost is always secret. Where did you practice this kind of ghost way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Small ring was in a daze for a while, way: &ldquo;ghost way, what ghost way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>After death, Monday fairy sighed to himself, but the ghost man in front of him was surprised. But seeing the surprised look on Xiaohuan&rsquo;s face, she didn&rsquo;t seem to be pretending. She didn&rsquo;t really know that this was the so-called ghost way. After a moment&rsquo;s silence, Mr. ghost said, &ldquo;the soul gathering skill you just performed is actually the most profound magic skill in the ghost way. Don&rsquo;t you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Small ring Zheng Zheng shake head, way: &ldquo;I, I do not know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost immediately asked, &ldquo;from whom did you learn this art?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Huan shook his head and said, &ldquo;no one taught me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost was stunned. He only listened to Xiaohuan and said, &ldquo;this soul collecting skill was naughty when I was a child. I played around in my grandfather&rsquo;s old house and fell into a dry well. I found these skills on the wall of the well. At that time, I was still young, and I learned it at random. I only used it once for so many years. Why, master, are you interested in this spell</p>
<p>Mr. ghost was silent, but after a long time, he sighed. His voice is rather bleak, but it is a bleak meaning.</p>
<p>Xiao Huan and Zhou Yixian looked at each other, and they didn&rsquo;t know why the man in black suddenly became depressed, but after a while. Suddenly, Mr. ghost called in front of him in a hoarse voice: &ldquo;little girl, what&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhou Yixian frowned, but Xiaohuan had already answered and said, &ldquo;my name is Xiaohuan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost nodded and said, &ldquo;I want to talk to you alone.</p>
<p>Can you come up here? &quot;</p>
<p>Zhou Yixian frowned. He obviously didn&rsquo;t want Xiaohuan to stay with this ghost like guy. However, Xiao Huan didn&rsquo;t think so much about it. He nodded and said, &ldquo;OK.&rdquo; Said, also regardless of Monday fairy secretly stop, walked in the past.</p>
<p>Mr. ghost looked at the little ring and nodded slowly. He seemed to approve of the young woman and waited for the little ring to approach. Slowly, he seemed to be pondering something carefully when he was talking, and whispered, &ldquo;are you willing to practice this ghost magic?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Huan was stunned and could not speak for a moment. But behind the black veil of Mr. GUI, his eyes were bright. It was obviously not a joke. He hesitated and hesitated.</p>
<p>Mr. ghost how experience, carefully look at the small ring&rsquo;s face and expression, will her mind guess eight or nine. At the moment, she did not force her, but said, &ldquo;when you cast the Dharma just now, how did you feel in the face of countless ghosts?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Huan&rsquo;s face was red. Then some white, low voice: &ldquo;I, I some fear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost said lightly: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not a shame that you are afraid of it. The world is ignorant and afraid of ghosts and spirits, but I don&rsquo;t know about ghosts. It&rsquo;s just a kind of thing before people die and die. Where men fear. Most of them are self possessed. &quot;</p>
<p>He pointed to the little ring and said, &ldquo;take you for example, you were afraid when casting the spell just now. Although you can still cast the spell, there must be countless illusions and all kinds of ferocious and ferocious pictures in front of you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Small ring repeatedly nodded and said, &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost snorted and said, &ldquo;in fact, the most important thing in the so-called ghost way is to control the heart demons. If you treat them calmly, all ghosts and spirits will not be able to move your mind. What&rsquo;s more, if you think about it carefully, the reason why those ghosts are angry and retaliating is that they look very hateful and violent, but they are just like countless people in this world. How can they not be crazy about them once they have the chance to escape and return to their sunny life? &quot;</p>
<p>He said with a sneer: &ldquo;people in the world criticize the evil things, but they don&rsquo;t know that they are the same. Isn&rsquo;t it ridiculous?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little ring looks thoughtful and nods slowly.</p>
<p>Mr. ghost said again: &ldquo;I know your mind and hate the reputation of ghost road. But you just saved the wild dog&rsquo;s life by using ghost magic. It can be seen that guidao is not worthless.</p>
<p>Today, I see that you have a hundred years&rsquo; unusual talent in the ghost road. I can&rsquo;t bear to miss it. So I have the heart to teach you, &ldquo;he said with a faint smile,&rdquo; as for the future, it doesn&rsquo;t matter if you find out how bad my behavior is and you want to kill me. We, the people in the ghost world, have no idea about these common rites. &quot;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan is startled and takes a step back.</p>
<p>Mr. ghost was silent for a moment. He looked at the small ring again. He hesitated and frowned from time to time in his beautiful face. Mr. ghost did not say much. He reached out and took out a half finger thick black paperless book from his arms and threw it to Xiaohuan. Xiaohuan subconsciously caught it and looked at him in amazement.</p>
<p>Mr. GUI said faintly: &ldquo;what is recorded in this book is some understanding of my practice of ghost way in my half life. Among them, there are many methods for refining weapons. I am confident that there is no comparable person in the world. It&rsquo;s up to you to learn or not to learn. &quot; Then he turned to leave.</p>
<p>Small ring looked at his back, subconsciously called a way: &ldquo;master, wait a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ghost Mr. body a meal, stopped, way: &ldquo;how?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Small ring is smothering for a while, square way: &ldquo;I, I still don&rsquo;t know elder your name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ghost Mr. back to the body, motionless, after a long time square light way: &ldquo;I pass your skill, not to want you to remember me, you do it yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, he got up and wanted to move on again. Xiaohuan&rsquo;s face changed quickly, and suddenly he said in a loud voice: &ldquo;this, you save my life and preach my Taoism. I have to call you master at all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost&rsquo;s body was shocked, as if the young and elegant woman behind him. The words were more intense than the five thunders. However, after all, he was very deep in practice, and soon recovered his calm. He turned around slowly and covered his face with black gauze. No one could see his face. However, from his shining eyes, anyone could see that he was in an unusual mood at the moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You call me master?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Huan&rsquo;s face turned red. On the contrary, she was embarrassed. She said, &ldquo;this is what I thought. If you don&rsquo;t want to, I will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ghost Mr. suddenly cut a way: &ldquo;OK, don&rsquo;t say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan was stunned and looked up, but the ghost gentleman took a deep look at Xiaohuan, nodded, reached into his arms again, took some things, handed it to Xiaohuan, and said, &ldquo;look, you call me a master, this is for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Small ring looked down, only a stack of seven dark triangular pieces, each inch and a half size, smooth edge, material can not be seen, like iron and non iron. Xiaohuan hesitated for a moment, looked at Mr. ghost, and saw that his eyes were quite relaxed, so he reached out and took it over. If you look at them carefully, you can see that there is a small hole at the top of these triangles, which are tied together by dark red silk rope. On each triangle, there are different dark red mysterious patterns on the front and back sides, some of which are burning like flames, and some are like roaring beasts. Received in the hand, only feel the tentacles cold, at the same time contains a faint bloody gas.</p>
<p>After death Monday immortal eye sharp, one eye can see these triangle piece is just the ghost Mr. saves the small ring when the thing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s called&rdquo; blood jade bone piece &ldquo;. It&rsquo;s the most precious treasure in the guidao sect. It&rsquo;s a magic weapon that can stimulate the ghost&rsquo;s way and different methods. With this magic weapon, the original five layers of Taoism can play at least seven levels. If the talent is better, it can stimulate ten levels of effect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan was surprised and pleased, nodded again and again, but Monday immortal was shaking his head in the distance.</p>
<p>Mr. ghost gazed at the little ring for a long time. He shook his head and sighed. He said in a low voice, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve only seen two sides of the night with you. It&rsquo;s just a matter of fate. If you have the chance, &ldquo;he looked up at the sky and said,&rdquo; you can help me save someone. &quot;</p>
<p>Small ring a Zheng, way: &ldquo;save people, who ah?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost shook his head in silence, as if with a bitter smile, and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll talk about it in the future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that, he suddenly turned around, as if he did not want to stay. The black figure was like a ghost, which shot out in an instant, and disappeared in the shadow of the forest in a twinkling of an eye. Small ring call can not, just open the mouth can not see that black figure. I don&rsquo;t know how, the man in black gave her a light and kind feeling. Little ring sighed and held the string of blood jade bone pieces in her hand tightly.</p>
<p>Next to Monday, the immortal hummed, came up, took the blood jade bone slice in the hand of Xiaohuan, looked at it carefully, turned it over, and said, &ldquo;grandfather, what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Monday fairy sneered: &ldquo;you worship good master, do you know what this thing is made of?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Small ring one Zheng, way: &ldquo;what thing is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The immortal said on Monday: &ldquo;this ghost is made from the skull fragments of the Yin man. I don&rsquo;t know how many more souls are added to it to have such effects.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan stayed for a moment, took it and looked at it, but he couldn&rsquo;t see that it was human bone, but it was more like jade. He couldn&rsquo;t help but look at Zhou Xian and said, &ldquo;grandfather, is it true? Where is this like a human bone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Monday, Xiandeng was very angry and said, &ldquo;if you find that guy who looks like a ghost but not a human being to be a master, don&rsquo;t you believe me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan spat out his tongue and took the blood jade bone piece into his arms and said with a smile: &ldquo;OK, grandfather, in the future, I will only do good things with this thing, not bad things, not just ok?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Monday fairy hums a, turn to walk, mouth Wu way: &ldquo;believe you just strange.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan laughs, charming infinite, follow up. (to be continued. )</p>
