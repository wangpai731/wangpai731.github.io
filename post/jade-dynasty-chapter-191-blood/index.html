      <p>GUI Li gazed at Jin Ping&rsquo;er for a long time, her eyebrows wrinkled slightly, but she didn&rsquo;t speak. However, Jin Ping&rsquo;er seemed to be doing nothing under the ghostly and sharp eyes. She didn&rsquo;t feel that her words at the moment were wrong at all. She looked at GUI Li with a smile.</p>
<p>In the dark fire altar, for a time, it was quiet. The monkey Xiaohui, who was lying on his fierce shoulder, seemed to dislike the atmosphere. He moved his body and called &ldquo;squeak&rdquo; twice. He jumped from his master&rsquo;s shoulder and fell on the ground. He looked around his head for a moment. Then he walked aside and slowly walked to the pattern engraved with countless red ferocious gods in the center of xuanhuotan.</p>
<p>GUI Li slowly drew back his eyes and looked at the little gray who was lying on the ground and making faces at those evil gods&rsquo; designs. He said slowly, &ldquo;so, do you know a lot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The golden vase&rsquo;er smiles slightly. The smile is warm like spring breeze. It gently sweeps across the cold palace and says, &ldquo;I am a little weak woman. How can I know anything? But I have been lucky to visit several places in the past and have been valued by the Lord of ghost king. This is to help you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She chuckled and said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t think too much about it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li frowned and didn&rsquo;t say a word. He didn&rsquo;t pay attention to the disturbing charm in the charming words of Jin Ping&rsquo;er. After thinking for a moment, he seemed to forget why the golden vase&rsquo;er suddenly appeared here, and the mysterious and strange that enveloped the golden vase&rsquo;er and even the ghost king. He only said lightly: &ldquo;in this case, I will ask you for advice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gold bottle son in the eye essence light a flash, but on the face smile is still charming, way: &ldquo;childe please say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems that you came here before me. As you said, it&rsquo;s said that if you want to seal the beast God, you have to use the&rdquo; eight fierce XuanHuo array &ldquo;here. But I&rsquo;m stupid and can&rsquo;t understand. Do you know what Miss Jin understands?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Golden Vase son shook his head and seemed to have a wry smile on his face and said, &ldquo;to be honest with you. In fact, I&rsquo;ve been in xuanhuotan for three days, but I&rsquo;ve got nothing. I haven&rsquo;t found anything except these messy images carved on the ground. &quot;</p>
<p>The ghostly eyes are not expected to look at the dark red pattern at the foot. Different from jinpinger, including Xiaohui, he had personally experienced the power of the weird array in the xuanhuotan, the overwhelming power of that day, and the terrible red flame beast. Are not easily forgotten memories.</p>
<p>Maybe it is because of this that Xiaohui is so interested in jumping on the ground, grabbing here and moving there. It seems that he is also looking for something?</p>
<p>Is it possible that after the earth shaking change on that day, volcanic lava burst into the sky and destroyed the array here?</p>
<p>This thought passed through GUI Li&rsquo;s heart, but it was not revealed. After pondering for a moment, he looked at the Golden Vase again. He said: &ldquo;Miss Jin, anyway, this is the only place we know that has the&rdquo; eight fierce XuanHuo array &ldquo;. Since it is indispensable to Zhenfeng beast God, we might as well stay here for a few more days. Maybe there is still some hope that we can not know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Golden Vase son smiles, amorous feelings infinite, way: &ldquo;good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li looked at her, then took back his eyes and sat down again before the ground array was carved. After a while, a faint fragrance came, but the Gold Vase sat down near him. But the distance between two people seems to be closer.</p>
<p>The ghost frowned and stopped. He did not want to see the beauty of the world around him. He only concentrated on this picture, but did not know how. In his mind, however, another thought suddenly came up</p>
<p>On that day, Xiaobai said that she would go to South Xinjiang to find the formula of &ldquo;eight evil XuanHuo array&rdquo;, but I didn&rsquo;t hear from her for a long time. I don&rsquo;t know how she is now. However, it seems that there is only one place in the world that has clues to the eight evil XuanHuo array, but Xiaobai is obviously not here. So, where will she be now?</p>
<p>Is she OK</p>
<p>In the next few days, the idea flashed in the ghostly mind from time to time.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>However, it seems that the eruption of magma on that day caused great damage. Although the stone carvings on the ground seem to be in good condition, it is obvious that there is no aura contained in them, or the anger with great power. Now, what is left is just a set of rigid stone images.</p>
<p>GUI Li and Jin Ping&rsquo;er worked together in the XuanHuo altar and understood it for seven days, but still got nothing. During this period, some disciples of the burning incense valley came in to check, and several times even Shangguan CE Qin brought his own people for routine inspection. However, today&rsquo;s ferocity, including jinpinger, has advanced in Taoism. He only hides in the dark place above the xuanhuotan, so he easily evades these inspections.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that I can&rsquo;t understand the essentials of the array, but it&rsquo;s really a headache.</p>
<p>On this day, they sat in front of these rigid stone carvings for a whole morning. Suddenly, the Golden Vase stretched out its waist. Its slender waist looked like a demon and a snake. It had the flavor of human soul. But at the moment, the only man by her side is still staring at the stone carvings on the ground, pondering hard, and paying no attention to the graceful performance of the Golden Vase.</p>
<p>The Golden Vase Er snorted softly and glared at him. There seemed to be a trace of complicated emotion in his eyes, but it was just a flash. After a moment, she sighed and said, &ldquo;do you see anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost sharp body move, this just slowly return to the God, turn head to look at gold bottle son, shake head, way: &ldquo;you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Golden Vase son wryly smile, did not answer, but the ghost is already understood.</p>
<p>Jinpinger frowned and said, &ldquo;we have been watching these ghosts here for seven days. During these seven days, we have tried our best, but let&rsquo;s not say that to activate this array is to touch some stone carvings, but what is the matter? &quot;</p>
<p>After a moment&rsquo;s deep meditation, he looked up at the dark place above and said, &ldquo;when I was saving people here that day, I touched the mechanism in this hall, and the eight evil XuanHuo array was immediately triggered. But, &ldquo;he said, glancing at the center of the hall, with a strange smell in his voice,&rdquo; but the mechanism is now gone. &quot;</p>
<p>Jinpinger looked along his eyes, and as expected, there was a small raised stone platform in the center of the hall. However, the stone there was scorched black and solidified into an ugly shape. What was the appearance of the ingenious mechanism.</p>
<p>In fact, as soon as GUI Li arrived here, he saw this scene. He knew that the strange stone mechanism he saw when he came here for the first time on that day had been destroyed. When he came to see the stone carvings of ferocious gods on the ground, his heart was filled with all kinds of violent breath. This time, however, is not felt at all.</p>
<p>This once terrible stone carving has become a dead thing.</p>
<p>Both of them fell into silence for a moment. They didn&rsquo;t know what to say. After a long time, jinpinger seemed to think of something.</p>
<p>As soon as he raised his head and was about to speak, his face suddenly changed, and his fierce eyebrows were already wrinkled. He turned around suddenly, and in the blink of an eye, he swept to the side of the small ash playing. He picked up the monkey, and then his body floated up. After a while, he disappeared in the darkness of the xuanhuotan hall.</p>
<p>Gold Vase son wonderful eyes see his figure three times disappear in the dark, smile. Then it floated up and disappeared into the darkness.</p>
<p>A moment later, a dull sound reverberated in the xuanhuotan hall.</p>
<p>The door is open</p>
<p>The sound of footsteps at the door sounded like a large number of people, but a dignified voice faintly came from it. After saying a few words, he immediately became quiet. Then, through the open door. Three people came in.</p>
<p>The first one was Yun Yilan, the leader of the burning incense valley. The one on the right side of the half body position behind him was his younger brother Shangguan&rsquo;s policy. The last person, several steps away from the two people in front of him, is Li Xun, the proud disciple of Yun Yilan.</p>
<p>After the three men entered the xuanhuotan, Li Xun, who was at the end of the walk, turned to close the heavy door. The original light was immediately separated from the room, and only the dim light flickered slowly here.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Lost the magic power of the array. The three layers above the originally cold xuanhuotan have already lost the bitterness and coldness. What remains is the indifference of huge and hard rocks. In the dark, GUI Li and Jin Ping Er quietly passed through the dark hole and looked down in the dark.</p>
<p>As if also know that this time is not better than before, always active small ash also seems to be quiet a lot, lying down on the master&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>Yun Yilan and Shangguan CE walked slowly to the center of XuanHuo altar, standing on the once eight fierce XuanHuo array. Looking from afar, his face seemed to be shrouded in shadow.</p>
<p>The three people below stood there, silent for a long time, and did not speak. The atmosphere was faint and strange. Looking at the gold bottle on top of his head, he looked at the gold bottle. Both of them saw the slight bewilderment in each other&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>Yun Yilan seems to have a gloomy face. Maybe his mood should have been like this. When he saw his business for many years turned into such a look, he was afraid that he was in a bad mood.</p>
<p>However, his face seems to have no expression at first sight. After looking at it for a long time, it gives people a vague and ever-changing feeling. However, if you observe carefully, you will find that his face has never changed. What has changed is just your intention.</p>
<p>At least, during that time in Qingyun Mountain, people in the world would not see his expression.</p>
<p>For a long time, Yun Yilan&rsquo;s wandering eyes were always moving on those strange red stone carvings on the xuanhuotan ground. From one end to the other, from one pair to the other, he slowly walked to the small burning stone platform in the center of the stone carving image, stretched out his palm and gently stroked the stone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long has it been?&rdquo; Cloud Yi Lan suddenly opened his mouth and asked in a low voice such a endless sentence.</p>
<p>Shangguance stood next to him. Seeing that his expression didn&rsquo;t show surprise because of Yun Yilan&rsquo;s sudden question, he obviously seemed to know something clearly, but he didn&rsquo;t mean to answer, but he was very strange. He turned his head and looked at Li Xun, who was three steps behind them.</p>
<p>Li Xun&rsquo;s head was slightly lowered, his face was respectful, his eyes were slightly closed, and he said nothing.</p>
<p>Without looking back, Yun Yilan seems to know all the things behind him, and says faintly: &ldquo;xun&rsquo;er is not an outsider. In the future, he will take over the burning incense valley. Don&rsquo;t hide these things from him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a slight shock, Shangguan CE calmed down and remained silent for a moment. He said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s been 30 days since we were ready to formally summon him.&rdquo; the &ldquo;red flame mingzun&rdquo; has not responded</p>
<p>Cloud Yi Lan&rsquo;s face did not change in the slightest, at most just in the eyes flash a few times, but give people the feeling is as if momentarily and gloomy a few minutes. At the top of the XuanHuo altar, however, there was a movement in his heart. It was not that he was surprised at the burning incense Valley and that he could not repair this strange array. However, shangguance just mentioned the so-called &ldquo;red flame mingzun&rdquo;, but it touched a place deep in his memory, almost subconsciously. He felt what shangguance meant——</p>
<p>The whole body of that one was enveloped in flames. Is the fiery and wild beast the key to the eight fierce XuanHuo array with a long history and strange origin?</p>
<p>The atmosphere in xuanhuotan is a little strange. Yun Yilan&rsquo;s face is not good-looking, and he doesn&rsquo;t speak, just pacing back and forth in the hall.</p>
<p>It seems that he is thinking about something, and shangguance only looks at the figure of his elder martial brother and doesn&rsquo;t speak. As for Li Xun, who is standing on the side, it seems that he only keeps a modest attitude and does not say a word.</p>
<p>With the passage of time, Yun Yi Lan&rsquo;s eyebrows gradually wrinkled, and his eyes showed a sharp light, as if something was fighting fiercely in his mind, but finally. He suddenly stopped, took a long breath and turned to look at shangguance and Li Xun behind him.</p>
<p>Shangguan CE looked at the cloud Yi Lan and whispered, &ldquo;elder martial brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yun Yilan seemed to have made up his mind, so he did not hesitate any more. He said coldly: &ldquo;Shangguan, younger martial brother, how important this array is in xuanhuotan, I don&rsquo;t need to say more. In any case, we must restore it. Otherwise, we have no other way to deal with him! &quot;</p>
<p>Shangguance nodded, did not speak, but away from the top of the three people in the dark. At the same time, GUI Li and Jin Ping&rsquo;er were shocked.</p>
<p>He?</p>
<p>Who is he?</p>
<p>Who is the person that incense Valley wants to use this strange array to deal with?</p>
<p>In the quiet xuanhuotan, what is flowing at the moment seems to be an invisible dark breath. Just, what cloud Yi Lan said next, but let the darkness around. It turned into cold ice</p>
<p>&ldquo;On that day, the Lava Burst out and damaged the array too much. The aura that we have absorbed for hundreds of years here in the incense Valley has been exhausted. In addition, we have lost the key of the array&rdquo; XuanHuo Jian &ldquo;, so we can&rsquo;t summon the red flame mingzun to restart the array. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if that person doesn&rsquo;t show up. We&rsquo;ll absorb from the beginning, but now it&rsquo;s time to use this array. &quot; Yun Yilan snorted coldly, and three deep textures appeared slowly between his eyebrows. The meaning of killing was faintly visible, and his voice was more and more indifferent.</p>
<p>Shangguan CE also has a deep eyebrow lock, but there is a trace of surprise on his face. He is surprised and says: &ldquo;how, is there any other way that elder martial brother can do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yun Yi Lan&rsquo;s eyes twitched slightly, and said: &ldquo;the array in xuanhuotan is arranged by our ancestors according to the records uploaded from the burning incense jade book. At the end of the jade book, another ancestor wrote down a remark of criticism. It is possible to take a risk against the dilemma of losing XuanHuo Jian and the XuanHuo array can&rsquo;t be started 。”</p>
<p>Both shangguance and Li Xun behind him were stunned, and then they were overjoyed. The &ldquo;incense burning jade book&rdquo; is the supreme treasure of the incense valley. Only the master of the burning incense Valley can understand it. Yun Yilan said so, it must be that there was a brilliant ancestor who left a wonderful idea.</p>
<p>Shangguan said happily: &ldquo;elder martial brother, what kind of magic method does that ancestor say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yun Yilan looked at the excitement of the two of them. On the contrary, they were more gloomy. After a moment&rsquo;s silence, he said slowly: &ldquo;the founder wrote at the end of the&rdquo; burning incense jade book &ldquo;: the XuanHuo array was born from the fierce air of heaven and earth, the red flame beast was fierce and violent, and the spirit inherited by the array diagram was also the God of eight wasteland. In this way, we can infer the ancient books of Southern Xinjiang The blood sacrifice of the living man is full of anger, and the gods return to their positions. The fierce beasts appear and the fire array is completed. &quot;</p>
<p>Shangguance and Li Xun changed their faces and looked at each other. They were speechless for a moment.</p>
<p>After a long time, shangguancai managed to recover from his uncertain mood and said in an astringent voice, &ldquo;is this really what our ancestor wrote?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Do you doubt the name of master Zulan</p>
<p>Shangguance&rsquo;s face changed again, and he even said, &ldquo;no, it&rsquo;s just that the living people&rsquo;s blood sacrifice is clearly a magic power. How and how can it appear on the jade book of our school?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cloud Yi Lan directly cut off Shangguan CE&rsquo;s words and said coldly: &ldquo;you&rsquo;re right. Although this ancestor wrote down these words, no one has ever tried this method.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shangguan CE looks at the eyes of Yun Yilan. Suddenly, he feels that his whole body is cold. He can&rsquo;t help but step back. The light from the corner of his eyes is aimed at Li Xun standing behind him. He is surprised to find that his face is as ugly as soil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elder martial brother, are you&rdquo; shangguance seems to have never spoken so hard and sad. &ldquo;Are you going to do this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cloud Yi Lan eyebrow a Yang, not angry but Wei, sneer: &ldquo;do not use this method that how to do? We have worked hard for hundreds of years, and we can see that great things will come true. But there were so many mistakes. Now even the most important array has been destroyed. Do you want me to look at the past countless efforts to pay east</p>
<p>Shangguance seemed to be hesitant and argued: &ldquo;elder martial brother, it&rsquo;s very important. This method is too much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cloud Yi Lan lenglengleng interrupted his words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shangguan junior brother, do you still have a trace of understanding of the right way in your heart? Over the years, what you have done for the sake of this great cause is not so right? &quot;</p>
<p>Shangguan was one of the top officials.</p>
<p>Yun Yilan&rsquo;s eyes were sharp, as if to insert into people&rsquo;s hearts, staring at Shangguan CE and saying: &ldquo;also, Shangguan&rsquo;s younger brother, this xuanhuotan was our important place on that day. Do you know that it is you who are in charge of it, but it is in your hands that has caused today&rsquo;s bad situation? &quot;</p>
<p>Shangguan CE&rsquo;s body was shocked, and he suddenly raised his head, but he saw that Yun Yilan&rsquo;s eyes were cold. He looked at him in front of him like a knife. Shangguan CE&rsquo;s face was excited and his body trembled slightly. He seemed to have something to say. But somehow, under the vision of cloud Yi Lan, he finally retreated back slowly, after a long time. &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; he said in a low voice</p>
<p>Cloud Yi Lan nodded and said, &ldquo;in this case, it&rsquo;s up to you to preside over it. In addition, xun&rsquo;er.&rdquo; He turned to look at Li Xun.</p>
<p>Li Xun&rsquo;s face was different at the moment. Suddenly, he heard his master&rsquo;s call. His body turned out to be an exciting spirit. He even said, &ldquo;the disciple is here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cloud Yi Lan looked at him and said: &ldquo;you follow your senior martial uncle, study hard, and help him by the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li Xun&rsquo;s face turned white and his voice suddenly hoarse, but he said in a low voice: &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yun Yilan finally looked at the stone carvings on the ground. She frowned. She turned around and didn&rsquo;t look back. She went out. In the heavy &ldquo;creak&rdquo; sound of the door, only shangguance and Li Xun were left face to face.</p>
<p>For a long time, without saying a word, the two men also slowly walked out.</p>
<p>The altar of fire fell into silence again.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>In mid air, there was a slight sound, and two figures floated down from the top. Xiaohui squeaked twice, jumped twice on the ground, and then ran to one side to play. For the first few days, it seemed to be interested in the stone carvings on the ground, but after a few days, the monkey was not interested in the stone carvings.</p>
<p>After GUI Li and Jin Ping&rsquo;er settled down on the ground, they didn&rsquo;t speak for a moment. The air around them was still faint and cold, as if the strange breath from Yun Yilan just now still didn&rsquo;t fade away.</p>
<p>After a long time, the Golden Vase son suddenly said, &ldquo;who do you think the man they mentioned just now could be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at her and asked, &ldquo;what do you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Golden Vase son smiles and says, &ldquo;I have nine points of assurance. They are talking about the animal God. Just listening to what they said just now, I am not sure whether they know the whereabouts of the beast God</p>
<p>GUI Li nodded in silence and said, &ldquo;there is another point. The eight fierce XuanHuo array is in this XuanHuo altar. Listening to their tone, they seem to want to use this array to deal with the beast God. Do they expect that the beast God will come to the XuanHuo altar, or the array can move</p>
<p>Jinpinger&rsquo;s eyebrows wrinkled slightly. Obviously, there were many joints in it that she didn&rsquo;t understand, so she was lost in thought for a moment.</p>
<p>His eyes turned slowly and fell on the stone carvings of ferocious gods on the ground. After looking at them for a long time, he suddenly gave a sneer and said, &ldquo;is this the so-called right way? Sacrifice evil gods with the blood of living people. Haha, it&rsquo;s among the demons, and I haven&rsquo;t seen anything like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before he had finished his words, he heard only the crisp laughter of the golden vase beside him. There was a faint strange tone, like a sneer, a mockery, and a faint fear. He said, &ldquo;how do you know that there is no such thing in our holy religion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li&rsquo;s body shook and turned to look at her. The Golden Vase stood smiling, but she had already turned her head away and no longer looked at him. &ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo; he said coldly</p>
<p>All of a sudden, the last word of &ldquo;thinking&rdquo; in his words had not been uttered, but his voice was mute. In that moment, somehow, he remembered that when the great wizard used magic to cure Biyao, he asked the ghost king to depict the array with blood.</p>
<p>And the ghost king, almost in a blink of an eye, then took out enough blood.</p>
<p>The basin of bloody blood, but from where</p>
<p>Standing there, he felt cold all over his body. He could not speak any more. (to be continued. )</p>
