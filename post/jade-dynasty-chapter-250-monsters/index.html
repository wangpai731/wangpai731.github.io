      <p>The ground was shaking violently, and the rocks were falling all around, and the astrolabe was full of light, illuminating the whole ghost king room. In the air, the smell of blood came, and the strong smell almost made people think that they were immersed in a bloody sea.</p>
<p>GUI Li didn&rsquo;t know why this kind of change happened suddenly, but after the initial consternation, he suddenly woke up and turned and yelled: &ldquo;Xiao Hui!&rdquo; ;</p>
<p>The cry suddenly spread far away. Soon after, the echo of his cry came from the stone chamber, and then it was suppressed by a more violent shaking and shaking sound. In the rumbling sound, the dust on the top of his head scattered, and the falling stones became bigger and bigger.</p>
<p>However, there was no answer. The familiar &ldquo;squeaky squeak&rdquo; call did not come, and there was an anxious look on the ghostly face. After a slight meditation, his eyes were already staring at the inner room. At the same time, Mr. ghost also moved over. He could not see his expression clearly with his black veil. However, his voice at the moment did not seem to be very flustered. Instead, he revealed general excitement in a strange calm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your monkey, should be in it!&rdquo; &ldquo;Ghost Mr. in the ghost sharp side, so light said.</p>
<p>He gave him a fierce look, and without hesitation, his body moved and had already swept into the inner room. Then he was stiff and stood in the same place. In the empty inner room, the dark dark door on the stone wall looked like a deep black hole, staring at him coldly.</p>
<p>Behind him, the light suddenly moved. It seemed that Mr. ghost followed him with the &ldquo;star chart&rdquo; which constantly radiated brilliant light in his hand. When he saw the secret door on the wall, he was also obviously stunned. It seems that he did not expect that a secret door would suddenly open in the stone wall here, or maybe he knew the secret door here, but he didn&rsquo;t expect to open it for a while Talk.</p>
<p>Both of them were men of high moral character. After standing in the inner room for a moment, they both felt the strong bloody air around them in the dark dark dark door.</p>
<p>GUI Li&rsquo;s face turned cold and took a deep look at Mr. ghost. Mr. ghost&rsquo;s eyes twinkled. After a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, he said faintly, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t look at me. I&rsquo;ve been away from your eyes these days. I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>He snorted coldly. Although his heart was full of doubts, the earthquake around him was getting more and more severe at the moment, and it was obvious that the missing ash had gone from this cave, anyway.</p>
<p>Now is not the time to investigate, he made a quick decision and said coldly, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost frowned and seemed to have some hesitation and hesitation. When he was about to say something, he only saw the ghost&rsquo;s sharp body shaking and had already rushed into the darkness of the dark door.</p>
<p>Mr. ghost stood there in silence for a moment. He looked at the shining astrolabe in his hand, and then looked at the dark door. Suddenly, he gave a light bar. He said: &ldquo;the human calculation is not as good as the heaven&rsquo;s calculation. Actually, a monkey is called to break the big event&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, he shook his head and gave a low, bitter smile, and the black figure floated up and swept into the secret door on the stone wall.</p>
<p>The passageway of the hidden gate on the stone wall is narrow and long. With the rapid deepening of the ghost, the terrain gradually descends, and the surrounding area begins to get wet. But the most disgusting thing is that it goes deeper and deeper. The stench of blood around him was strong again.</p>
<p>At the moment, people are in the passage, and the surrounding hard stone walls are shaking violently. If ordinary people walk here, there is a fear that the stone walls on both sides will collapse down and bury them alive. However, he could not see this worry on his fierce face at the moment. He could only see his figure moving faster and faster. After a while, he had reached the hole on the other side of the passage, fell down and looked up. Right in front of us is a long platform surrounded by red light and red shadow. From the direction of the platform, there is a faint but familiar roar.</p>
<p>GUI Li&rsquo;s face changed slightly. As soon as he heard the roar, he could recognize that it was Xiao Hui&rsquo;s roar. But what was in the red shadow and what kind of danger could Xiao Hui transform into this life and death struggle?</p>
<p>He did not hesitate. He rushed into the dark red shadow like lightning, and behind him, Mr. ghost floated down the hole slowly. When he got to his feet, he did not make any other movements. Instead, he looked back. Behind the place where he stood, one was the hole that had just entered, and the other had an equally dark passage. What Mr. ghost saw was that This is another channel.</p>
<p>Mr. ghost gazed at the passage for a moment, then slowly withdrew his eyes and fell on the astrolabe he held in his hand. Only after he saw this place, gold ancient characters appeared in the center of the astrolabe, which lit up and fell slowly in the white light. It was extremely magical, and seemed to be responding to something.</p>
<p>Mr. ghost looked up to the front, and the dark red light and shadow flickered disorderly and violently. A huge stream of air was rushing across. In addition, the violent earthquake and shaking stone walls around him seemed to announce a great danger. Just in the face of these, but his eyes but the emergence of a smile, step toward the dark red light, he walked briskly past.</p>
<p>The ghost ran into the dark red light and shadow. Almost when the red light shone on him, he suddenly felt a slight dizziness. Although he had recovered in an instant, he was still shocked by the sight.</p>
<p>The huge blood pool, the broken wall and the bloody air in the air were all beyond his expectation. In the middle of the sky, at this moment, a human shaped monster formed by countless red blood gas appeared. It was more than ten feet tall, which almost filled the huge cave. At the end of the platform, Xiao Hui, who is a giant monkey, roars loudly and has no fear. However, his body size is similar to that of the giant. Most importantly, it seems that Xiao Hui has no strength to fight back. When the bloody giant constantly spews out huge flames like blood color from the giant mouth, he has to constantly avoid it.</p>
<p>The fierce blood flame from the air to chop down, sweeping everything, where even the hard rock is melting. Although Xiaohui was not a common body, he did not dare to make a hard connection. He had to jump around on the platform and avoid the danger of the arrow. Looking at his gray hair at the moment has been black and blue, obviously has eaten a lot of crying head, now is just strong self-supporting, lingering just.</p>
<p>At this moment, Xiao Hui tried his best to jump up, and only then could he avoid the blood flame sweeping under him. Even in the air, he felt his fur burning under him, and he could not help shouting. But this time it still seems to have dodged, it fell from the air. Who knows when double feet on the ground, suddenly between the feet of sharp pain, almost to the bone marrow. Xiaohui looked down, but saw that the rock surface on the platform under his feet had been turned into hot stone water. His feet have been burnt for a moment.</p>
<p>This pain is not trivial. Xiaohui&rsquo;s huge body is on the verge of falling, but the bloody giant in the sky seems to have no pity. There is a layer of blood flame spreading all over the world. It seems that the small ash is going to be broken in the blood flame. The giant monkey looked up to the sky and yelled. It seemed that there were also several angry shouts from far away, but it was obviously useless.</p>
<p>At this critical moment, a long cry came from behind, like the song of a dragon. A blue light, like a rainbow, crossed the sky. Like thunder, like a flash of lightning, the danger arrived. In an instant, a blue light shield was formed in front of the little gray body. The sharp light in the green light flashed, and a Tai Chi pattern appeared. In the loud noise, it blocked the seemingly invincible blood flame of the bloody giant.</p>
<p>It was at the critical moment that Gui Li arrived.</p>
<p>It was just that although this blow was blocked, the body was shaking violently, and it turned out to be a burst of blackening. The light shield was almost dissipated, and the body was almost hit and fell into the blood pool. Fortunately, he had a profound way. When he fell down, he took advantage of the edge of the stone platform, and the whole person had already floated up. Glancing at the Giant Monkey, he quickly glanced at Xiaohui. Without saying much, he grabbed Xiaohui&rsquo;s body, drank a little, and grabbed Xiaohui&rsquo;s huge body away from the ground with one hand.</p>
<p>Xiao Hui gave out a cry of pain. The body floated up, in mid air, the bones of the whole body made a gurgling sound, a moment later, the body size rapidly reduced, and in a twinkling of an eye has returned to the normal size of the body, became the little gray haired monkey.</p>
<p>At the moment, the bloody giant on his head seemed to be more and more angry because someone suddenly blocked his blood flame. The target also shifted to Gui Li. He looked for a huge mouth and &ldquo;bang&rdquo;, a blood flame of five Zhang Long gushed out, just like a red flame falling from the sky and burning to the ghost.</p>
<p>GUI Li grabbed the ash and put it on his shoulder. He called out, &ldquo;hold on!&rdquo; And then his body floated up again. At the moment, the speed of his body moving forward and backward was much more flexible and faster than Xiaohui. Although the blood giant&rsquo;s blood flame was extremely powerful, he always flitted between the blood flame gaps, which was much more leisurely.</p>
<p>But Xiaohui is not idle at the moment. When he recovers his normal body, he grabs the ferocious Lapel in one hand and flies up and down in the middle of the air. He is still sitting steadily, but on the other hand, he grabs his feet and looks at him. His face shows a painful look, &ldquo;creaky and squeak&rdquo;, and then he can&rsquo;t stop making a fan with his hand and blowing a cool wind towards his two feet, It&rsquo;s probably the soles of your feet are scalded!</p>
<p>However, when he heard Xiao Hui&rsquo;s cry in his ear and saw Xiao Hui&rsquo;s movements in the corner of his eyes, he was able to calm down in his heart. It seemed that he had not been seriously injured except for a little skin injury.</p>
<p>After a little peace of mind, the flying body became calm. Although the blood flame was powerful, it was powerful and slow. He was not afraid of it seriously. Taking this opportunity, he began to look around and observe the bloody man himself in the space of avoiding the blood flame.</p>
<p>The bottom of one&rsquo;s feet is like an abyss, but the blood pool under the abyss is a strange scene, especially when ghosts and Li see the four spirit animals soaked in the blood pool, they are stunned. Among the four spirit beasts, except for the wild Zhuo dragon, he had no contact with them. The other three were all closely related to him, and they were all imprisoned here.</p>
<p>And he suddenly remembered that the ghost king had devoted all his efforts to the ghost King sect in recent years. From * Niu, the earliest ten years ago, to the gathering of all the four spirits and beasts, was it for the purpose of setting this weird needling technique here?</p>
<p>He suddenly raised his head and looked at the bloody giant. A blood flame came to his head. The wind was burning like fire around him. His body was like a ghost. In a moment, he dodged the past by several feet. The blood flame roared on the stone wall behind him, only making the rocks fly wildly, leaving a huge hole several feet in the hard wall.</p>
<p>The ghost floated in the air and looked far away. He saw that the whole body of the giant was made up of blood and aura. The red mansions were steaming like clouds, and the mouth was filled with blood flame. This huge aura seemed to be inexhaustible and endless.</p>
<p>However, this time, the sharp light in his eyes flashed, but he did not stay in the same place, but along the direction of the blood flame. Only three feet away from the fiery blood flame, retrograde and upward, is to rush toward the blood giant itself. Xiao Hui lies on the shoulder of the ghost, watching more and more close to that terrible giant, and has no fear at all. On the contrary, he was excited to &ldquo;squeak and squeak&rdquo; and waved his fist. He had the courage to fight with one of them.</p>
<p>The bloody giant didn&rsquo;t seem to expect a sudden counter attack. In addition, his body was too large to reflect. In a twinkling of an eye, between the ghost and fierce incarnation of a green shadow, such as the arrow from the string shot into the huge body composed of blood.</p>
<p>As soon as he entered the body, he felt a heavy pressure coming from all directions, and his body slowed down. At the same time, his ears were filled with the sound of wild cries, such as hell&rsquo;s ghost crying and Qi and blood surging. I can&rsquo;t see anything clearly. He frowned and his face was full of gold.</p>
<p>The body is solemn, the golden light rises, and the bearing is magnificent. In a twinkling of an eye, the external blood gas is forced back three feet, and the internal discomfort is also improved.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the surrounding blood changed again. In the red fog of blood, countless faces of people appeared around the ghost. There were laughter, sadness, anger and ferocity on their faces, just like thousands of ghosts gathered together. Around the ghost body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help me</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take your life</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t leave&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Die</p>
<p>Innumerable suddenly appear murmur, like flood general swarm, thousands of red arms, out of the blood mist. Toward the ghost to grasp, which is terrible straight can not be described by words. However, this kind of magic and illusory mind skill is an excellent magic method for others. However, it happens to be a nemesis when it comes to the &ldquo;great Brahma Prajna&rdquo;, which is famous for its ferocious mind.</p>
<p>Buddhism is the great enemy of ghosts. The thousands of ghost faces around seem to be surging and powerful, but as soon as they get close to the ghost and the whole body is covered with golden awns, they send out shrieks one after another to avoid. A few who can&rsquo;t escape have been burned up by the Golden Buddha&rsquo;s awns. In a flash, they are in smoke and ashes, refining into a cloud of ash powder, and dispersing with the wind.</p>
<p>With such great Dharma protection, he was even more fearless. His body rushed forward. There were countless ghost faces in front of him, but no one dared to block them. With a sound of &ldquo;puff&rdquo;, he had passed through the body of a bloody giant and rushed out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boom ;</p>
<p>The blood giant made a strange roar, as if very angry, and his huge body slowly turned around. Although the ghost passed through smoothly, his face became very dignified. The whole body of the monster was made of blood, visible and immaterial. He had penetrated through it just now, which obviously had no effect on it. In this way, is it not that he can only be beaten and can&rsquo;t fight back, but he can see that the spirit of the monster is full of vitality, and the spirit is full of agitation in the cave, and the ghost is obviously not felt There is a scattered aura rolling into the giant&rsquo;s body. If it continues like this, it will only kill itself first.</p>
<p>While thinking about how to deal with this seemingly invincible blood monster, the blood giant changed first. Suddenly, the huge body of blood and Qi suddenly broke up like a collapse, and countless blood and gas came out, forming a thick blood mist. However, there was no sign of dissipation. Instead, it gathered more and more tightly, and finally became one About ten feet of red blood gas sphere, like a red sun, radiates thousands of red light in mid air.</p>
<p>Just as the ghost was stunned, there was a loud noise in the blood cell. After a moment, thousands of red tentacles were shot out from the blood mist. Each tentacle has the thickness of a bowl, and it is tens of feet long. The blood on it is steaming and flying.</p>
<p>In an instant, the whole huge cave has turned into a sea of red tentacles. Just now, the powerful blood flame can avoid the past, but at this moment, in the face of the ubiquitous and terrifying tentacles, even the ghostly can not help but feel numb and discolored.</p>
<p>From the beginning of fighting with Xiaohui, he radiated and corroded the ball, summoned skeletons, and later incarnated as a blood giant, and then to the myriad tentacles of strange blood cells. The mysterious array of strange forces in the cave seems to have endless magic power. However, in its ferocity, it has changed thousands of times, which makes people feel desperate and unable to deal with it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, no ;</p>
<p>The sound of breaking the air was sharp, and the overwhelming tentacles rushed from all directions. There was no way to retreat, there was no place to avoid. The face was grim. After a big drink, the golden light of the whole body lit up at the same time, forming a light shield to wrap the body and small ashes. At the same time, there was also a magic weapon in the hand for the first time.</p>
<p>It was just a blink of an eye. In the sharp scream of toothache, the red tentacles all over the sky rushed down and immediately surrounded the ghostly mask. Let&rsquo;s not say it&rsquo;s airtight. Even if there&rsquo;s a little light and gold in it, it can&rsquo;t be seen. It&rsquo;s totally weird red tentacles. They are tightly bound up and become a strange red sphere in the air.</p>
<p>The red tentacles wriggled slightly, and the ground was tightening. In the air, the red sphere surrounded by red tentacles gradually subsides and rebounds to its original state after a moment. However, the surrounding tentacles exert force again and sink in a little bit. Knowledge seems to have a strong rebound force and is slowly rebounded back.</p>
<p>It was like a heartbeat, like a breath, repeated many times. Suddenly, there was a burst sound from the red autumn body. After a moment, it turned into a loud noise. A large area of red tentacles seemed to have been blown apart, and immediately they were torn into pieces by great force, and then turned into red smoke and dispersed around. Under the shadow, the ghostly figure flashed out from the air and landed on the platform in the middle of the blood pool. However, the body at the foot was soft and almost unstable.</p>
<p>Seeing the extremely pale face of GUI Li, he faintly heard the voice of his panting, with his way of doing at this time.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, he was forced to such an extent by the strange enemy in front of him in this short time. We can imagine the power of the four spirit blood array. It&rsquo;s just that the four spirit blood array and the Fulong Ding are obviously not that. Although they are trapped out of the trap, a large red tentacle that is exploded in the air is a huge blood cell in the air. It doesn&rsquo;t seem to matter at all. In fact, after the tentacles burst, they turn into red smoke aura. In a flash, most of them are sucked back by the strange red ball. Such aura cycle endlessly, and even the most powerful people are invincible.</p>
<p>Just a moment later. More red tentacles were born from the red blood cells suspended in the air. Countless long red tentacles were waving and waving in the sky, which was really terrible and frightening, and even the ghost was cold.</p>
<p>Seeing more and more red tentacles covering the sky, making a sound and roaring down again, the ghost has already retreated. The ghost in front of him is not like that of human beings. It is impossible for human beings to resist it. Just as he unfolds his body and is about to open the world, he pours down on the red tentacles like a storm and sweeps towards the cave entrance. All of a sudden, Xiao Hui, a monkey who has been lying on his shoulder, screams The cry was rapid, as if he had found something and pointed to the huge red ball in the sky.</p>
<p>He was stunned. Just now, all his energy was struggling to deal with the terrible red tentacles. How could he spare time to observe the red ball? At the moment, he still raised his head in a hurry and took a glance at the red ball in the distance along the direction of small gray fingers.</p>
<p>At this time, he stopped. At the deepest part of the red sphere, which was as red as blood, there was a light white light shining in the deepest part of the red sphere, which was quite different from the fierce red light around him. Almost at the moment when the white light was on, the strange red ball monster that was invincible and invincible was also changed. It was like an air bag full of original scenery, which was stiff in an instant After a pause, most of them were turned into red smoke, while the small part of them shrank back, and the huge red blood cells, which were originally more than 10 Zhang in size, were also rapidly shrinking.</p>
<p>Even if the fury of the fury, there is no sense of bitterness in the air.</p>
<p>At present, this sudden change happened suddenly, which made people dazzled and stunned. However, as the red light in the sky gradually weakened, under the intense gaze of the ghost eyes, it finally revealed a group of monstrous red clouds in the deepest part of the red blood cell.</p>
<p>The color of the blood red awn there is the deepest. From a distance, it seems that it is intensely like bleeding. And the white light that reverses the universe is also emitted from the deepest part of this red cloud. Although it looks weak compared with the surrounding violent blood gas, there is no sign of wavering. On the contrary, it is around the white light like a light dagger, and the blood is red The awn slowly faded and dissipated.</p>
<p>Suddenly, GUI Li suddenly realized that the earthquake at his feet and around the huge grotto was gradually calming down. Only the bloody smell in the air was still so intense. I wonder if it was because there was too much blood in the blood pool under his feet.</p>
<p>In the middle of the air, the blood was still in the lower legs. There was a sharp whistling sound from the red awn, which seemed extremely unwilling but helpless. Finally, after all the redness had subsided, the deep red cloud revealed its true face.</p>
<p>An ancient cauldron with ancient and primitive forms is engraved with strange inscriptions. On the front of the tripod, there is a strange devil face in the middle of the forehead. The white beam, which seemed to be dazzling at the moment, was emitted from here.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fulong Ding!&rdquo; ;</p>
<p>GUI Li recognized it at a glance. This ancient Ding was the most important and mysterious magic weapon of the ghost king in the past.</p>
<p>GUI Li slowly turned around, and his eyes were collected from the Fulong Ding which was suspended in the air. Looking around, you can see the grottoes and stone walls that are already dilapidated and cracked, the monstrous and terrifying huge blood pool under your feet, and the impotent and painful four spirit beasts imprisoned in them. Are all these things done by the ghost king?</p>
<p>And the terrible and strange power above the head, the invisible monster, should not exist in this earthly world. Is it the ghost king who summoned it?</p>
<p>There are no other words to describe such acts except &ldquo;insane&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Xiao Hui seems to be in the fierce battle at the moment, lost the former active temperament, quietly lying on the ghost sharp shoulder, but his three eyes. However, he kept looking at the Dragon tripod in the sky, and seemed to have a lingering fear of the mysterious power just now.</p>
<p>He stood in awe for a long time, then slowly walked to the end of the platform. The ground under his feet passed through the fierce fight just now, which affected the fish in the pond. The original hard ground had already turned into potholes, and there were big holes and small holes made by corrosion or huge force. He stood on the edge of the platform, looking down like the first little ash.</p>
<p>Lying on the shoulder of the small ash at the moment also take back to look at the Fulong Ding eyes, low low cry a few. It seems that there is also the meaning of entreaty, want to ask guitie to rescue the spirit beast such as Tao below. The strange awn in his eyes twinkled and his eyebrows were locked together. He felt something wrong when he saw the four spirits under him in the confusion. At the moment, if you look carefully, you will find that the four so-called ancient spirit beasts are all very weak. Nine out of ten of them are fighting with spirit power.</p>
<p>GUI Li has never heard of such vicious miraculous skills in the world before. It seems strange that the mysterious array is set up in this huge cave. And the Fulong Ding in the sky.</p>
<p>He could not help hesitating. For him, the evil four spirit blood array was not in the least favorable to him. However, three of the four spirit beasts at the bottom had a good relationship with him and had a long history. In terms of cleaning up, it seemed reasonable to help them out of trouble. However, he was no longer that simple young man. When he thought about it, he already thought that the array was so powerful, not to mention that it must have cost the ghost King countless efforts to complete the arrangement. If he rashly took the ghost King&rsquo;s great event, wouldn&rsquo;t it mean that he would turn over his face?</p>
<p>In fact, if I just turn over with the ghost king, I don&rsquo;t have the slightest fear. If I say it, I will turn it over. However, there is a Biyao lying there for ten years</p>
<p>At the thought of Biyao in his heart, the light in his eyes darkened. He sighed and stood up straight. He shook his head in silence. Xiao Hui was anxious. He grabbed his ears and scratched his cheek. He waved his hands and pleaded with his face. Obviously, he wanted to rescue the spirit beast below. Grimly brow tight frown, the face is uncertain, the heart is also indecisive.</p>
<p>At this time, a clear voice came out from behind them. The ghost and Xiaohui were both surprised. At the same time, he turned his head and saw that Mr. ghost in black came to the platform behind them. However, the astrolabe, a magic weapon of ancient times, was brilliant. The light was surging like waves and turned into a light around the astrolabe The column, straight into the sky, actually echoes with the magic light column on the Fulong tripod.</p>
<p>And in the dazzling light column, the lower part of the chart is transformed into countless white light petals, one by one connected together, just like the lotus throne under the Buddha and Bodhisattva. It is crystal like and will arch the astrolabe. On the astrolabe, there is an ancient golden character shining in the bright light, floating and sinking in the brilliance, but this time, it is bright However, the gold is no longer dim, but more and more bright.</p>
<p>With the shining of the gold, like echoing, in the air, the brightness of the light dagger that tied the Fulong Ding also lit up.</p>
<p>The ghost sharp heart suddenly a tight, stepped on a step, the sharp voice way: &ldquo;what do you do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, Mr. ghost seemed to turn a deaf ear to the evil words. At the moment, his black figure was completely wrapped in the radiance of the astrolabe, and his eyes were fixed on the suspended astrolabe in front of him. Somehow, he was less ghost and more solemn.</p>
<p>I can see that under the bright light of the astrolabe, Mr. ghost&rsquo;s hand is like a Tathagata picking flowers. Leisurely and leisurely, in the center of the most brilliant star chart, it seems that with his guidance, another scenery font shines out. The generous light rose and fell in the light above the astrolabe, and Mr. ghost did not hesitate for a moment, his eyes were fixed on the center of the light as if he were looking for something, for a moment. Four more times in the center of the chart.</p>
<p>The four golden characters appear in turn. The whole astrolabe is full of brilliance, and the scope of the light column around it has been expanded more than twice. Correspondingly, the &ldquo;heaven and earth place&rdquo; light column on the Fulong tripod above the sky has suddenly expanded several times, and it gives out a light sound of Kaka and keeps shaking. It seems that it is out of body.</p>
<p>It was a great surprise. No matter how stupid a person, after the fierce battle just now, knows that the magic light column on the devil&rsquo;s face is the only thing that can imprison that invincible and strange force at the moment. If the lock of heaven and earth is actually untied, how can we imagine the consequences.</p>
<p>At the moment, he could not care about any more. In his impatience, he swept up his body and rushed to Mr. ghost. He cried out: &ldquo;stop it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, although he was as fast as lightning, when he rushed into the five foot distance between Mr. ghost and the astrolabe, he was opened by a soft but abundant invisible force, which was when the ghost was blocked. Mr. ghost again points down on the chart.</p>
<p>This time, he seemed to point very slowly, and his fingers trembled slightly, not knowing that he was nervous. It was the result of too much force and all the strength. A little trembling fingers reached into the radiance of the astrolabe. There was a momentary pause. After a while, I only heard a soft crackle, the seventh golden font. Slowly rising above the chart.</p>
<p>It seems that the seventh gold is larger and more profound than the previous six gold characters. After rising to the sky, it does not fluctuate like other gold characters. Instead, it rises slowly and is fixed in the sky. With the seventh gold lettering rising into the sky, the other six gold characters immediately gathered around it and formed a circle around it. In an instant, the seven gold characters were full of gold and gathered together to make a column of gold light. However, the fingers were thick and thin, and they rushed to the heaven and earth lock light column on the Fulong tripod.</p>
<p>In the huge cavern, the huge cave which was turbulent not long ago, suddenly fell into a strange silence. Everything was quiet, and there was no breath. All the eyes, the ghost, the ghost, the small ash, the spirit beast in the blood pool, and even the weird existence in the dark, all held their breath and watched, that was about to happen!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pa!&rdquo; ;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very light, light, crisp sound.</p>
<p>The light column of the heaven and earth lock on the Fulong tripod quickly faded away, leaving a small hole in the middle of the devil&rsquo;s face, and the golden beam from the astrolabe just above the hole. A moment later, a bead slowly rolled out of the small hole, showing a dark blue color and falling into the golden light column.</p>
<p>The golden column of light slowly drew back, and slowly fell, and the mysterious blue bead also slowly fell towards the astrolabe. When the Pearl was closer to the ground and could be seen more clearly, you could see that the blue color was like the boundless sea, endless, and the light smoke was locked in it, slowly flowing like the tide rising and falling, the sun, the moon and the sky.</p>
<p>The golden column of light gradually dimmed, and the seven golden characters on the chart gradually faded, and finally disappeared. The dark blue pearl, which was removed, was suspended half a foot above the astrolabe and slowly began to rotate. The bright light around the astrolabe faded away, and gradually recovered from the chart. Soon, the chart returned to its original shape, suspended in the sky, only three times a faint soft light. In the center of the jade plate, those small pieces of jade like stars are still running and gliding endlessly. The difference is that there is a beautiful blue rotating bead above the astrolabe As if the astrolabe is the sky, all the stars are only around that beautiful dark blue star bead and running.</p>
<p>The principle of heaven and earth, hundreds of millions of years of long time, seems to be in this moment, quietly revealed in this small chart.</p>
<p>In the cave, there was silence. It seemed that everything was awed by this magnificent and magical sight. However, the silence lasted only for a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boom ;</p>
<p>There is a huge roar of unspeakable roar, with thousands of years of ecstasy since ancient times, endless blood in this cavern. Everywhere is a strong blood vapor transpiration, every corner is a roaring red light and shadow. The Furong Ding, which is highly suspended in the sky, rushes towards it wildly 。</p>
<p>On the ancient tripod, the originally pale and mysterious inscriptions light up one by one. With a strange rhythm, they turn into blood colored words. In the air, mysterious and strange sounds are heard, such as the old and lonely ancient spirits, chanting poems forgotten for thousands of years.</p>
<p>The color of red and blood red, like the tide, flooded through the whole Fulong Ding, turning it into a red and shining monster. Finally, all the blood was around the demon face in the front of the ancient Ding Ding, and it was eroded upward from the chin. Red lips, flooded nose, swallowed eyes.</p>
<p>Finally, it seems that all the blood and gas roared together, and the whole Fulong Ding trembled. All the fierce blood lights and shadows roared together in this huge cave. The piercing sound roared incessantly. The blood in the blood pool began to boil, the earth moved and the mountains rocked, and the rocks fell like rain.</p>
<p>Blood, surging like an unstoppable torrent, filled the cave where the little blue once was, and dyed the whole devil&rsquo;s face red.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boom!&rdquo; ;</p>
<p>Huji mountain top, the wind and cloud change color, the sky falls the God thunder, explodes in the sky mountain top!</p>
<p>Strong wind, blowing out the huge stone smoke Li, Xiao Xiao heaven and earth, a desolate Xiaosha scenery!</p>
<p>In the cave of Huji mountain, the ground and stone walls were shaking in the violent earthquake again, and the rocks fell one after another. However, the ghost King seemed unconscious. At this moment, his eyes had become blood red and extremely strange.</p>
<p>In the trembling stone chamber and falling rocks, he slowly raised his right hand to see. In the palm of his right hand, a blood red inscription appeared clearly from the flesh and blood of his right hand. It was shaped like an ancient tripod, vigorous and powerful, with a bit of strange color.</p>
<p>The ghost King stared at the tripod shaped inscription in his hand. After a moment, he began to laugh slowly. The laughter was full of violence, with a bit of madness and even hysteria</p>
<p>&ldquo;Success, success, finally success! &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he gasped deeply. His voice had already become hoarse. His facial muscles were twisted and his face was as red as blood.</p>
<p>Suddenly, he suddenly clenched his right hand into a fist. In an instant, a powerful force came from his body. He could almost see the tiny little blood awn beating like a small lightning in his hand, and the surrounding stone walls seemed to have been pulled by a huge force. In a moment, a large piece of rock fell down and the rocks were flying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the roaring laughter, with madness and pride, the ghost King walked toward the entrance of the stone chamber. But at the entrance of the stone chamber, he suddenly stopped for a moment. In the craziness and violence on his face, he suddenly showed a hesitation and moved his body, as if he wanted to turn around and have a look.</p>
<p>Behind him is the quiet body of Biyao.</p>
<p>However, after a short moment of hesitation, the ghost king did not turn back. The huge and hard stone gate suddenly split and flew out in front of him. In the fierce earthquake and the splash of stone rain, the ghost King strode out of the cold stone room with a fierce determination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boom The violent vibration constantly makes a strange noise of collision, and the falling stones are getting bigger and bigger, as if they are about to be swallowed by the river here. And this thin green figure, quietly lying on the stone platform, lonely and quiet, with a bit of desolation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ding Ding&rdquo; clear bell sound, quietly, reverberated in this stone chamber, but soon was drowned by the sound of the collapse of the greater roar of falling rocks. (to be continued. )</p>
