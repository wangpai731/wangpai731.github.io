      <p>This battle of arrogance has accomplished Zhang daphou Even when the leader and others looked at Zhang daphou, they were all curious. Especially the leader, he was shocked after a look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mindfulness He looked dignified. When he said his words, all the elders and palms around him were shocked. After carefully looking at them, their eyes brightened.</p>
<p>Xu Meixiang took LV Tianlei away to heal her wounds. Otherwise, it would be incredible at the moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Big fat was brought back to the mountain by younger martial sister Mei Xiang when he was very young. Now he has a promising future. He should cultivate his soul and cultivate his mind. He should focus on training in the future.&rdquo; The leader was pleased and spoke slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speaking of it, gentle girl is also good. Although she is not as good as God, she also has her own chance. She has a special reason with my mountain guard sword of Qingfeng mountain. Now she is feeling in Qingfeng cave. If she can succeed, I may have another guardian of sword spirit in the future.&rdquo; The palm seat of Qingfeng mountain said with a smile.</p>
<p>When the south bank cheered and the north bank was silent, the Tianjiao battle ended and the leader announced the result.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun became the first person to fight against Tianjiao on both sides of the Strait! To be promoted as a disciple!</p>
<p>Reward to plant daoshan Tianjiao Pavilion, choose a condensate treasure qualification!</p>
<p>At the same time, reward the secret land of Lingxi sect once, and realize the chance of magical power! It&rsquo;s just that this chance is wasted when it comes to condensing gas. If you can get the first disciple, you will be able to build the foundation. Therefore, when you use it, you will get the best effect.</p>
<p>Finally, there are ten thousand spirit stones as rewards!</p>
<p>At the same time, Zheng Yuandong was the top ten disciples appointed by the imperial court. He was praised as Tianjiao and promoted to the inner disciples. Later, all the talents gradually dispersed.</p>
<p>The north bank is bleak, the south bank is excited, those Tianjiao is more complex, ghost teeth stare at Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s back, take a deep breath, still unconvinced, turn to leave.</p>
<p>As for the other Tianjiao on the north bank, Gongsun brothers and sisters also clenched their fists, and so did Xu Song. They all decided to close down immediately after returning to the mountain!</p>
<p>As for Zhou Xinqi on the south bank, she always felt that these things were not true. Looking at Bai Xiaochun, she looked a little dazed. Compared with her, what was more untrue about all this was Shangguan Tianyou.</p>
<p>His whole person is gloomy, almost no one around him to see him, his initiative to attack the scene, became a disgrace, forever left in the hearts of the people on the south bank.</p>
<p>With a sad smile, Shangguan Tianyou firmly grasps his fist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just condensing gas, building foundation I will be the first to build a foundation, surpass Bai Xiaochun and ghost teeth! &quot; With a decision, Shangguan tianyouqiang stood up his pride and went away as a rainbow.</p>
<p>Gradually, all the crowd scattered, although the Tianjiao war was over, the impact of the Tianjiao war was just beginning.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s name, from this moment on, spread all over the north and south, especially on the north bank. His name is unknown, but it has become a taboo!</p>
<p>That is the public enemy of the north bank, and that is the shameless person who brings shame to the north bank!</p>
<p>Beihanlie, in particular, was taken back to the mountain by his master. He immediately closed the door and had no face to see people. As for the big dog, he untied the contract and directly left it on the north bank, giving up the ownership.</p>
<p>Although the nocturnal beast is not popular, no one dares to control it. As a result, the big dog has almost become a wild dog. Occasionally, it can be seen in the four mountains on the north bank</p>
<p>Countless north shore disciples are all holding back their strength and swearing that one day, Bai Xiaochun will pay the price and be disgraced with blood!</p>
<p>Even the north bank spontaneously formed an organization called miechun alliance. The mission of this organization is to destroy Bai Xiaochun!</p>
<p>And Zhang daphou, also because of this battle of arrogance, was completely famous. The last stop of Bai Xiaochun and ghost teeth, the seven or eight treasures of soul refining, was really shocking.</p>
<p>As a result, Zhang daphou became the new pride of ziding mountain. Countless people went to visit him, hoping to gain Zhang&rsquo;s friendship and refine his spirit.</p>
<p>Zhang daphou is proud of himself, but he is reserved. Not everyone gives his soul to him. The more he is, the more he is regarded. Even Xu Meixiang calls Zhang daphou to the place. After careful interrogation, she feels strange. Especially in Zhang daphou, she clearly feels the existence of ideas!</p>
<p>Finally, Zhang daphou was strictly forbidden to refine spirits for others. He was told that he could not refine spirits for others unless he gave Bai Xiaochun five times of alchemy.</p>
<p>In this regard, although Zhang daphou was surprised, he nodded and agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Refining soul is the most mysterious. Maybe there is some kind of connection between Bai Xiaochun and Zhang daphou Only by complementing each other can we achieve great success. &quot; Xu Meixiang looked at Zhang daphou who had left. She was thoughtful and didn&rsquo;t ask her questions in detail. The purpose of Lingxi sect is that every disciple has his own reason and should not be greedy. Otherwise, she will violate the root of the sect and punish severely. Moreover, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s identity is not ordinary. Even she can&rsquo;t take it at will.</p>
<p>Lingxizong will never fall down and become more and more powerful. This iron law is also one of the key points.</p>
<p>A few days later, Bai Xiaochun got the clothes and tokens of the inner disciples. Under the guidance of elder Xu, who was in charge of the inner gate of Xiangyun mountain, he packed his bags and left the courtyard where he had lived for several years.</p>
<p>Inner disciple, you can live in a cave with more Aura!</p>
<p>The so-called cave, the cave of heaven and earth, contains heaven and earth. Bai Xiaochun is the first one in Tianjiao battle. He chooses the best cave naturally. At the back of Xiangyun mountain, at the end of a mountain path, there is a quiet but spiritual cave.</p>
<p>There are five stone rooms in the mansion, and the top hall is full of night pearls. Especially in the hall, there is a small spring eye. The spring water is so hot that it has some temperature, forming a hot spring lake which is tens of feet long. There are some fish swimming in it.</p>
<p>The whole cave, although simple, can give out a sense of atmosphere, refining pharmacy, closed room, spiritual planting area, trial method, all complete.</p>
<p>There are two puppets whose accomplishments are comparable to that of five layers of gas condensate. They are responsible for Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s daily life. Each stone chamber in the mansion has its own array. Once the array in the hall is opened, the rock wall above will be illusory and reveal the sky. At night, the stars and moonlight can be seen outside. Once opened, even the monks in the early stage of foundation building will be hard to master for a while Break open.</p>
<p>This cave is more than enough for the foundation builders. It is one of the best caves in Xiangyun mountain.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun was very satisfied and surprised. Compared with here, he felt that the courtyard he had lived in was too simple and crude, so he happily sent elder Xu away. Before leaving, elder Xu told Bai Xiaochun to go to the inner gate Lingge and choose a skill designated by Li Qinghou, and then he left.</p>
<p>When Bai Xiaochun saw elder Xu go, he immediately stripped off and jumped into the spring. He made a comfortable sound, especially when the little fish swam outside the body and pecked them gently. The feeling made Bai Xiaochun feel that life is like this, and there is no need to ask for it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity that Du Lingfei is not at the gate. Otherwise, it would be nice to have a bath here.&rdquo; When Bai Xiaochun sighed, she thought of Hou Xiaomei, and immediately she was so excited that she decided to find a chance to bring her here and watch the stars in the night sky in the hot spring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am an ideal person. I should let Hou Xiaomei and Du Lingfei take a bath together here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun thought for a while, deeply thought that her previous thought was too small.</p>
<p>The next morning, Bai Xiaochun left the cave early. When she walked out along the path, she saw a cave not far away from her own.</p>
<p>The distance between the two caves is tens of Zhangs, just like the opposite door. When the upper array is opened, it also looks like someone is living. Bai Xiaochun is very curious. She looks a few more and takes her eyes back and walks away.</p>
<p>All the way slowly walking in the mountain half of the mountain, there are almost no outside disciples, are some inner disciples.</p>
<p>Most of them either shut down or go out to carry out their duties. However, Bai Xiaochun coughed in front of them and put on a praise appearance. After waiting for the other party to be stunned, he called him &ldquo;Uncle Bai&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In this way, in the call of Uncle Bai, Bai Xiaochun was full of energy and swaggered to the inner gate Lingge of Xiangyun mountain. This is the place for the inner disciples to learn martial arts.</p>
<p>Every newly promoted inner disciple can come here free of charge to learn an internal skill. As soon as Bai Xiaochun arrived, the disciple in charge of Lingge quickly got up to see him. Bai Xiaochun was more pleased and patted the other side on the shoulder, so he chose to do it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaven and earth cut?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The true meaning of fire and water!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The nine days and the earth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But after a long time, he was dazzled by these skills. He didn&rsquo;t know what to choose. He seemed to be very powerful. Finally, he found what elder Xu said and Li Qinghou appointed him to practice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dragon image into the sea Sutra?&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun holds a jade slip, and the spirit power melts into it and looks at it. The opening words of the dragon like sea Sutra make Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s scalp explode.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are shackles for human beings, and there are shackles that can&rsquo;t be broken through in the origin of life, no matter what one&rsquo;s cultivation or his physical body I created this skill, which is suitable for the practice of condensing Qi. Although the shackles are unbreakable, I can feel it! &quot;</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun took a breath. He immediately remembered what he had said when he saved his life and claimed to be the guardian of the mausoleum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five volumes of immortality, breaking through the five shackles of life, five volumes of longevity, breaking the five seals of eternity!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun immediately felt that the Dragon elephant Huahai sutra was extraordinary. She went to look at it carefully and frowned gradually. She found that this skill did not seem to have any earth shaking power. For example, the amazing skills that Bai Xiaochun saw were not as good as those. However, it could perfectly graft the skill of controlling tripod with purple Qi and improve the probability of foundation construction!</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun had been dreaming about building foundation many years ago. Now when I think of it, her heart beat faster.</p>
<p>There are only three layers in the longxianghua sea, corresponding to nine layers of condensate, ten layers of condensate, and the last layer is Build the foundation!</p>
<p>To the extreme, the body has the power of dragon and elephant, and the spiritual power in the body turns into a vast ocean. The most rare thing is that it will have a profound foundation. After the foundation is built, it can be inclusive of any skill and magic power, and there will be no rejection or wrong path.</p>
<p>Can be said to be extraordinary in the ordinary!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll choose him!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun immediately made a decision. No matter whether it was the shackles mentioned in the opening words or improving the probability of foundation construction, Bai Xiaochun was moved at any point. He took the dragon image to turn the sea Sutra and walked out of the inner gate Lingge to exchange the Sutra, and then walked toward the cave.</p>
<p>When passing by the opposite cave, the gate of the cave suddenly opened. A woman came out and saw Bai Xiaochun. It was late when she was about to go back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why? Nephew Xinqi Bai Xiaochun is immediately surprised. In Tianjiao&rsquo;s war, Zhou Xinqi is far away from him. He wants the other party to call him his uncle, but he has no chance. At the moment, Zhou Xinqi is his neighbor, and he is immediately happy.</p>
