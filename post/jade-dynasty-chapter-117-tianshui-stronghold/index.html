      <p>I don&rsquo;t know whether the sky in southern Xinjiang is always so cloudy in this season. After coming out from that small mountain, under the guidance of Xiaobai, two people and a monkey go to the west of the burning incense valley.</p>
<p>That night, the volcano erupted in the xuanhuotan of the burning incense valley. The heaven and the earth changed. It was very powerful. There was induction within a hundred miles. A few days later, in the gloomy sky of Southern Xinjiang, the big hole burned by the hot magma disappeared, but there was still a big cloud, showing a red and yellow color. It was very strange that it hung high in the direction of the burning incense valley.</p>
<p>The great changes in heaven and earth, which have attracted people&rsquo;s attention, now take place in the always low-key and mysterious burning incense valley. In addition, the position of burning incense valley itself in the cultivation of the right way has attracted people&rsquo;s attention.</p>
<p>For a time, there were rumors all over the world, all of which were speculating about what happened in the burning valley?</p>
<p>But in the past few days, in the wild land of Southern Xinjiang, which had always been peaceful, many strange faces and countless public or hidden forces began to gather, all of them were secretly exploring what was going on.</p>
<p>This situation, of course, is not what the burning incense Valley likes. On the contrary, the burning incense Valley is extremely annoyed by some unknown secrets.</p>
<p>On the one hand, the burning incense Valley is kind to the disciples sent by the righteous sects such as Qingyun gate and Tianyin temple. They are well served with tea and water. At last, the natural disaster is perfunctory. On the other hand, for the secret spy of the three sects of the demon sect, the burning incense valley will not tolerate in its own sphere of influence. For a time, there were flashes of swords and swords on the vast land around the burning incense Valley in southern Xinjiang.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that people in the righteous way and the demon sect all feel the mysterious atmosphere of the burning incense Valley, which reveals a little unusual. The burning incense Valley seems to have been greatly stimulated. Almost all the disciples in the valley have been mobilized to search all over the southern Xinjiang day and night. As for who and what to search, they are hiding and hiding.</p>
<p>Over the past few days, there was a lot of activity in the gloomy sky of Southern Xinjiang, and many dazzling and beautiful lights were often seen flashing through the sky. All of them are excellent disciples of the burning incense valley.</p>
<p>Rumors have also been generated.</p>
<p>There are rumors about the birth of some strange beast, or the mysterious treasure rising from the volcano. this is not the only one.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more bizarre is that there are also vivid rumors about the internal strife in the burning incense valley. Some rebel disciples killed the valley master Yun Yilan.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Yun Yilan, the leader of the burning incense Valley, didn&rsquo;t show up for several days. In the end, the rumor became more and more fierce. Even within a few days, it shocked Taoist immortal of Qingyun gate and master Puhong of Tianyin temple. They sent their disciples to burn incense Valley to inquire. The burning incense Valley is crying and laughing, so I have to explain that the valley master is closed and can&rsquo;t come out.</p>
<p>It was confirmed that Qingyun sect and Tianyin temple were relieved. However, the leaders of the two sects were so different that they couldn&rsquo;t figure out what was going on in the middle. So they secretly ordered the disciples not to rush back to the mountain and explore in secret.</p>
<p>Nowadays, the world is in chaos, and the burning incense Valley has always been mysterious and ambiguous. At that time, the battle of Qingyun happened to be absent, which was not associated with anything. Therefore, the action that Guili accidentally rescued Nine Tailed Tianhu, who had been suppressed for three hundred years, triggered the waves of the world and the storm gathering in southern Xinjiang.</p>
<p>Because the burning incense Valley sent countless disciples to follow up and investigate each other, so that they would not be afraid of these disciples in order to practice the Taoism with Guili and Xiaobai, but it would be a lot of trouble to think that if their whereabouts were exposed. And if you stir up the big people in the burning incense Valley and lead the people to chase you, I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s hard to resist. After all, burning incense Valley is a millennium school. The potential is unpredictable.</p>
<p>Ghost Li read and now the top priority, or to trace to be able to save the black witch Yao.</p>
<p>So after coming down from that hill, at Xiaobai&rsquo;s suggestion, Guili found a remote village and bought two sets of local clothes, one male and one female. Change with Xiaobai.</p>
<p>In the remote areas of South Xinjiang, the customs are naturally different from those of Middle Earth, that is to say, the clothes that people wear on their bodies are different from those of Middle Earth.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s clothes bought from a remote village, it&rsquo;s not surprising that the hand work on the clothes is rough. On the body, the biggest difference between these clothes and the middle soil clothes is that, in addition to the different styles, the colors are relatively bright. The men&rsquo;s clothes are based on dark blue, while the women&rsquo;s clothes are colorful and colorful.</p>
<p>Because in order to avoid burning incense Valley, GUI Li and so on can&rsquo;t resist the air. Although GUI Li is worried, he persuades Xiaobai that he has been waiting for ten years. Can&rsquo;t he wait for a few days? If the burning incense Valley chases the soldiers because of a hurry, I&rsquo;m afraid that the situation will be chaotic, but I don&rsquo;t know when to go!</p>
<p>Although GUI Li is anxious, he can&rsquo;t deny Xiaobai&rsquo;s reasoning. They walk slowly.</p>
<p>Dressed in southern Xinjiang costumes, they walked along slowly. On the way, they met several groups of followers of the burning incense Valley, but they didn&rsquo;t recognize them. At most, it&rsquo;s because of the peculiar appearance of the little ash. I&rsquo;ve seen more.</p>
<p>The most important thing is that on that night, neither the ghost nor the ash was exposed, so the people in the burning incense Valley didn&rsquo;t know what they looked like. They just checked the strange strangers and ignored them.</p>
<p>At this moment, GUI Li and Xiao Bai are walking on an ancient road 300 miles away from the burning incense valley. It&rsquo;s just in the wilderness. There is no one on the road. Just half an hour ago, they came over from a group of incense Valley disciples.</p>
<p>The sky is overcast, the clouds are moving gently, the brows are frowning slightly, and they are walking forward. On the contrary, Xiaobai&rsquo;s face beside him was always smiling with high interest. She looked around and looked at the scenery of Southern Xinjiang, even though it was the desolate ancient mountain road, in her eyes, it seemed to be the most beautiful scenery.</p>
<p>The ghost Li looked at the side, the monkey small ash sat on the small white shoulder at the moment, poised. I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s because they are rare creatures in the world. Xiaohui is very intimate with Xiaobai, the incarnation of Jiuwei Tianhu. In recent days, it seems that Xiaobai has been stuck with Xiaobai for a long time.</p>
<p>Looking at Xiaohui and Xiaobai joking from time to time, they look like squeaking and laughing. Suddenly, the ghost thought that if the old friend Zeng Shushu on Qingyun Mountain saw such a look, he must be envious!</p>
<p>Xiaobai is wearing the ordinary clothes of women in southern Xinjiang. The style is no different from that of ordinary people. However, the ordinary clothes, matched with her unique appearance, will shine and heat as soon as possible, and even show the never seen style. However, it seems that this woman should be born to wear such clothes, revealing the unique charm of women in southern Xinjiang.</p>
<p>Xiaobai seems to have noticed the ghostly look, and looked at it in a twinkling of an eye. Smile: &ldquo;how, I wear this dress, but also good-looking?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ghost sharp light smile, with his temperament. Unwilling to answer such a slightly frivolous topic, he turned to ask, &ldquo;I think you are very familiar with the customs and environment of the southern Xinjiang. Apart from that, there is an ancient and remote village in the mountains near the burning incense valley that you can find. Have you ever been here before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaobai sips her mouth. Looking forward, we can see that the mountains in the distance are connected and endless, which is the unique landform of Southern Xinjiang. There is an ancient road in front of you, winding forward, with strange rocks and abrupt hills on both sides, far or near.</p>
<p>In the distance, the mountains are connected in the sky, and the dark clouds are hanging on the top of the mountains, drifting with the wind.</p>
<p>She walked slowly. After a while, he sighed and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never been here before&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ghost Li tiny sense surprised, way:&rdquo; what&rsquo;s the matter</p>
<p>Xiaobai takes a long breath, smiles and shakes his head. He seems to want to shake off the past years, saying: &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t know! The origin of our fox demon family is here in the south of Xinjiang. I grew up in this poor place. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ghost Li Zheng for a while, way:&rdquo; that how this thousand years, the folk legend of the Middle Earth place. Has always had your fox demon&rsquo;s shadow? &quot;</p>
<p>Small white light way: &ldquo;that&rsquo;s because a thousand years ago, I led our fox demon family, left here, went to the Middle Earth. Finally, he settled in the Huqi mountain in the southwest</p>
<p>The ghost Li was surprised, but he couldn&rsquo;t speak for a moment. After a while, he said astringently, &ldquo;what, you&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaobai looks at him with interest, smiles, and there is a light in his eyes. It seems ambiguous and vicissitudes of life: &ldquo;unexpectedly, it&rsquo;s the place where the general Hall of your ghost King clan is now.</p>
<p>In other words, the name of huqishan is mostly because of our fox demon family! &quot;</p>
<p>The ghost Li was silent for a long time and said slowly: &ldquo;then you can have the ghost King clan&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaobai didn&rsquo;t wait for him to finish, but shook his head directly and said: &ldquo;you can rest assured that our fox demon family and the ghost King clan have been neighbors for hundreds of years, and have nothing to do with each other. Not only that, there are several love between human and demon in these hundreds of years. So, in addition to repay you for saving me from XuanHuo altar, knowing that you are a disciple of the ghost King clan is one of the reasons why I am willing to help you. &quot;</p>
<p>The ghost Li just put down his heart, then thought of another thing, and said: &ldquo;after that, do you still want to go back to huqishan to visit your peers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kinship?&rdquo; Xiaobai&rsquo;s face gradually darkened. He looked up at the sky. After a long time, he said softly, &ldquo;all my family members have been killed by me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ghost Li is a Zheng again, small white wry smile, look more see desolate, but do not want to say again go on.</p>
<p>In a moment of silence, the ghost Li turned away the topic and said, &ldquo;we have been walking for three days now. How far is it from the&rdquo; qilitong &ldquo;you said</p>
<p>Xiaobai looked at him and crossed his face like water, saying: &ldquo;qilidong is the largest settlement of Miao people in southern Xinjiang. According to my impression, in the past 20 Li, it has been a bustling place for all ethnic groups to live together. It is called&rdquo; tianshuizhai &ldquo;. From there, there is a sinister path to the south, which is the road to qilidong of Miao people.&rdquo; Later, she smiled bitterly and said, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t know if there has been any other change in the situation here in the past three hundred years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost Li silently nods, subconsciously quickened the pace.</p>
<p>Xiaobai follows him, his eyes linger on him for a few times, and looks forward to the front. The mountains are connected, towering, majestic and precipitous, as if they are giants. He looks at these little people in the heaven and earth, on the ancient road</p>
<p>In the past ten years, GUI Li has come to southern Xinjiang for the sake of Biyao many times. He knows more or less about the local conditions and customs here.</p>
<p>The south of Xinjiang is vast and sparsely populated. In addition to the wild and alien tribes in the 100000 mountains stretching for thousands of miles in the extreme south, the people who live in the border area of the south for generations have five major tribes, namely, Miao, Tu, Zhuang, Li and Gaoshan.</p>
<p>In terms of population, the Zhuang nationality has the largest population, accounting for 40% of the total population in southern Xinjiang; in terms of territory, the Miao nationality has the strongest influence, occupying the most fertile land; in terms of folk customs, the alpine nationality with the smallest population is the most aggressive.</p>
<p>These five tribes have lived in this southern frontier for generations. Each of the five ethnic groups has its own language, but on the whole, when they communicate with each other, they use the common language similar to that of China and Turkey, except for some local ethnic &ldquo;characteristics&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In the past few years, there have been times of mutual communication and hand in hand, but there are also contradictions of fighting with each other. It&rsquo;s been a long time. Gradually formed the situation that each of the five tribes is based on one side, but the territory is interlaced with each other in depth.</p>
<p>In the places where each tribal territory is connected, there are often villages and villages where several ethnic groups live together. The largest number of people of five tribes live in one place at the same time. Live together.</p>
<p>The Tianshui village in xiaobaikou is located on the border of Miao, Zhuang, Tu and Gaoshan ethnic groups. It is also a famous and lively place in the southern border area.</p>
<p>As the sky darkened and approached dusk, it was ghostly, white and grey. Two people and a monkey finally entered Tianshui stronghold.</p>
<p>Although there is a village character in the name of this place, it is fundamentally different from the mountain villages usually built in the south of Xinjiang. Tianshui village is built on a spacious flat land. There is a road out of the village in the southeast and northwest. According to Xiaobai Road, it was originally built by the Tu nationality, and the original site is not here, but on a mountain not far to the West. Because there is a clear spring on the mountain head, it is called Tianshui village 。</p>
<p>It was only later that the four ethnic groups bordered each other. With more and more people, this place has become a place of mixed population.</p>
<p>However, the number of business trips increased gradually. Living on the mountain again, the place was narrow and inconvenient, and it was also very difficult to travel. Even though the people in southern Xinjiang were generally stronger and healthier than the Chinese and Turkish people, no one would like to climb the mountain and exercise every day.</p>
<p>From then on, people began to move to live under the mountain, from less to more, after a long time. The people in the whole village have gradually moved down. With the prosperity of trade among the four ethnic groups, business trips are more frequent and the scale is expanding. As for the original mountain stronghold. It is gradually abandoned. The name Tianshui stronghold is the only one that has been kept.</p>
<p>At the moment, it&rsquo;s just getting dark. There are still many pedestrians on the street. They come and go, and there&rsquo;s a lot of noise around them. The languages of all ethnic groups ring from time to time, which is quite different from the desolation in the ancient road when we just came. Sitting on the little white shoulder, the little grey felt very interesting. The monkey turned around and looked around, squeaking and screaming.</p>
<p>After all, the monkey with three eyes is different, which soon attracted the attention of pedestrians in the street. There are also several children in southern Xinjiang tribal costumes. They follow them happily, making faces at Xiaohui and teasing her.</p>
<p>Xiaohui was fond of playing. He got excited for a while. His tail was dangling. He was about to jump down to play. Fortunately, he made a sharp hum and dragged it to his hand. Xiaohui is helpless. She knows she can&rsquo;t run away, so she has to climb on her shoulders and scream at the children behind her. She also makes the same grimace and goes back. Those children are even excited. She doesn&rsquo;t know what to say. She laughs and thinks it&rsquo;s mostly fun.</p>
<p>The ghost Li eyebrow light wrinkles, in the heart slightly some is bored, but is not for the small ash to play, but faintly thinks of some other concerns.</p>
<p>He turned his head and looked aside quietly. He saw a smile on Xiaobai&rsquo;s lips. He was looking at the group of children playing with Xiaohui. They were dressed in coarse cloth and linen, but where could they cover her soft and bony beauty.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not to say that in the southern border area, the weather is severe, and most of the women are ordinary in appearance and dark in skin. It&rsquo;s the human figure that has been cultivated for thousands of years by Xiaobai in the middle land. It&rsquo;s the delicate and beautiful appearance that gives off a faint sense of softness, a smile and a frown. It&rsquo;s all fascinating.</p>
<p>Sure enough, a moment later, more and more people came to see it in the laughter and scolding of a child, and the eyes of those adults, naturally and rapidly, moved from the monkey to the beautiful woman who was also hard to hide in the coarse linen clothes.</p>
<p>In an instant, the invisible sound wave spread away, and people were surprised at it. However, the woman under countless eyes did not have the slightest sense of shyness at all. She seemed to like this feeling when she smiled all the time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not his intention to be so eye-catching. He&rsquo;s wondering whether to remind the woman beside him to find a place to live. He&rsquo;ll get up early tomorrow and go to the qilidong to do business.</p>
<p>However, it seems that his ideas are doomed to be unfulfilled, and the roles that inevitably appear in numerous stories that have been handed down in the world even appear at this moment.</p>
<p>The legendary hooligans originally existed in the southern border areas and among the ethnic minorities.</p>
<p>Three people came out of the crowd, all of them were men of almost the same appearance, tall, rude, hunchback, half familiar with the common language with local characteristics, and began to flirt with Xiaobai.</p>
<p>Rogue a: &ldquo;Er, black What a beautiful woman she is! &quot;</p>
<p>Xiaobai smiled, brushed her face with her hands, and said: &ldquo;is that right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>All of a sudden there was an uproar in the crowd.</p>
<p>The three hooligans are very happy. Hooligan B opens his shirt and shows a good figure: &ldquo;little sister, follow me! I&rsquo;ll let you eat spicy It&rsquo;s delicious! &quot;</p>
<p>Many people in the onlookers smiled at the time. Xiaobai gave a fierce look to the standing one, with no less smile on his face.</p>
<p>Rogue C laughs at rogue B and says, &ldquo;do you know what it means to eat spicy food and drink spicy food?&rdquo; Then he turned to Xiaobai and said, &ldquo;my little sister, I have a good land of ten thousand mu. You follow me, and I will guarantee you&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said half of what he said, but he couldn&rsquo;t say it for a while. He saw that Xiaobai&rsquo;s smile was more intense, as if it was the charm emanating from his heart. His eyes were like water in a pair of bright eyes, as if they were going to flow out.</p>
<p>But, her body, but a step back, stood beside the ghost sharp body, soft voice way: &ldquo;I but have a husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was another uproar around the crowd. The monkey ash, which had climbed on the shoulder of GUI Li, fell off the shoulder of GUI Li with a whoosh and fell to the ground.</p>
<p>After a while, somehow, Xiaohui suddenly lies on the ground, beating with monkey&rsquo;s palm on the ground, grinning and laughing.</p>
<p>He stood there with a grim face, feeling the fierce eyes of the three rogues in front of him, full of hostility.</p>
<p>After a while, the hooligans rushed up. It seems that the southern proverb &ldquo;wife comes out of fist&rdquo; is still alive for thousands of years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bang! Bang! Bang! &quot;</p>
<p>Three voices, three figures fly out, hit the roadside wall, and then fell heavily, loudly * *.</p>
<p>The onlookers were stunned, and said with a light spirit: &ldquo;let&rsquo;s find a place to live, and leave in the morning tomorrow.&rdquo; After that, he went forward and caught up with the little ash lying on the ground two or three times. He jumped on his shoulder and kept chuckling. He turned around and made a face at Xiaobai.</p>
<p>Xiaobai smiled a little, followed up, walked to the side of Guili, and suddenly whispered, &ldquo;you see I have been locked up for three hundred years, so I am not old yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li didn&rsquo;t say a word, just quickened his pace. (to be continued. )</p>
