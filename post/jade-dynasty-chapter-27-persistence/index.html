<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Applause thundered, &ldquo;dry&rdquo; position, is another world. Everyone was shouting, obsessed with the two beautiful figures on the stage.</p>
<p>The brilliant light of amber and Zhuling and the endless blue light of Tianya divine sword make it look like a fairyland on earth, which is extremely beautiful. But what is more beautiful is the two young women who are flying in and out of the clothes. From morning till now, an hour has passed, and the two sides still haven&rsquo;t won. In particular, Tian ling&rsquo;er of dazhufeng, under Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s Tianya divine sword, was surprised to find that he had not been defeated for such a long time.</p>
<p>Off the stage, Tian not easy, Su Ru, master Shuiyue and other senior people are all on the stage, needless to say, even the leader, Taoist Xuan, is sitting on the chair, watching the wonderful competition, smiling and nodding frequently, which is very gratifying.</p>
<p>Tian is not easy to connect with Su Ru&rsquo;s family. It&rsquo;s even more tense. However, seeing Tian ling&rsquo;er&rsquo;s nimble Taoist skills, he doesn&rsquo;t lose the wind at all, and his heart is relaxed. Tian can&rsquo;t easily see his wife beside him. Seeing her look nervous, he whispered, &ldquo;relax, ling&rsquo;er is OK.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru turned her head to look at her husband, smiled a little, and turned to look at the stage again. Tian is not easy to shake his head slightly. Suddenly, he finds that the disciples around him, even the other disciples in the distance, are in a commotion.</p>
<p>He turned his head to look at it. In a moment, he also stayed for a while because of his deep cultivation.</p>
<p>In a narrow passage that the crowd automatically let go, Zhang Xiaofan came slowly, his clothes were all burnt, even some places were still smoking, his face, hands and body were full of large pieces of burnt black, a pungent smell came to him. Everyone could see that he walked very hard, as if he had exhausted all his strength in one step, but he still walked forward and walked persistently for some reason.</p>
<p>Tian can&rsquo;t easily just watch his youngest disciple come over slowly. Without saying a word, his chubby body left his seat and stood up. Su Ru felt something, looked at her husband strangely, and then found that it was not right. Looking along his eyes, her face turned white and immediately stood up.</p>
<p>At this time, more people are looking here.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan walks in front of Tian not easy. Tian not easy looks at his most neglected disciple. He doesn&rsquo;t know how stubborn he is, but suddenly there is a burst of uncontrollable anger in his heart. This anger is so strong that even though he tries to suppress it, everyone can still hear his anger: &ldquo;seven, which guy hurt you so much, isn&rsquo;t it enough to win ？”</p>
<p>Su Ru&rsquo;s body shocked. She heard that her husband was really angry for the little disciple she despised in the past. She was worried. It was not easy to pull the field, but her eyes fell on Zhang Xiaofan.</p>
<p>On both sides, all the disciples under the gate of dazhufeng were so shocked that they all stayed in the same place and forgot to help younger martial brother.</p>
<p>On the stage, Lu Xueqi and Tian linger are fighting fiercely. The magic weapons are flying in the air. The spirit of immortality is awe inspiring.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan took a deep look at the stage, then looked at the master in front of him, and saw the angry look on his fat face, as if there was a trace of care.</p>
<p>He shook his head wearily and whispered, &ldquo;no, master, I won.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, he just felt dizzy in his head. In a moment, the sky was dim and he fell to the ground with a plop and fainted.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan fell to the ground and didn&rsquo;t wake up, but what he said before he fainted made all the disciples from Dazhu peak to Tian not easy to go down. After a while, Tian not easy and others reacted and helped Zhang Xiaofan up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard for Tian to take a close look. He found that the little apprentice was almost scarred as if he had been burned by the fire, but his internal organs and viscera were not seriously affected. Most of his fainting was due to exhaustion, and he didn&rsquo;t know what happened in the competition just now. He pondered for a moment, and saw that more and more people around him were looking at this place. He didn&rsquo;t want to stand here and be watched by others. Then he picked up Zhang Xiaofan and whispered to Su Ru, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take Lao Qi back, and you&rsquo;ll watch ling&rsquo;er here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru frowned, but nodded and looked at Zhang Xiaofan, whose eyes were closed tightly. The anxious look on her face could not hide any more. The people of Dazhu peak nearby also gathered around. Du Bishu said, &ldquo;master, I will accompany you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian is not easy to shake his head and say, &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the moment, even immortal daoxuan&rsquo;s attention was also attracted, saying: &ldquo;brother Tian, is this your disciple? What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian is not easy to light way: &ldquo;he is not good at learning, suffered some slight injury, I take him to treat, excuse me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan nodded, turned around and looked at the wonderful fighting method on the stage. With Tian not easy to hold Zhang Xiaofan out of the crowd, the matter quickly fell down. People were excited again for the two beauties on the stage. Only a few young disciples standing outside the crowd, inadvertently found that most of the disciples in the wind back to the peak were livid and gathered in groups to the distance.</p>
<p>If Zhang Xiaofan were here, he would surely see that it was the place where the book competition took place.</p>
<p>　　※※※</p>
<p>Under Jiuyou, Yanluo hall is full of flaming fire. People are burning, crying and shouting. It&rsquo;s bloody and scorching. Zhang Xiaofan wants to vomit when he hears it. Zhang Xiaofan only feels that the sky is turning. But in a moment, he suddenly returns to that peaceful little mountain village many years ago. The breeze is so light and pleasant.</p>
<p>However, a thunderclap resounded through the sky. The sky was as dark as a mountain, like the raging sea. In a flash, the kind and friendly villagers became the dead bodies of the mountain, and the peaceful village became the hell on earth!</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shouted as hard as he could, tightening his muscles, and a deep pain came from his chest, which made him take a breath of cool air, shiver and wake up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, wake up, Xiao Fan wake up.&rdquo; Familiar with almost in the deep heart of the voice, the first time sounded, with a bit of worry and joy. Zhang Xiaofan opens his eyes and sees Tian linger.</p>
<p>As if, back to the past, she was dressed in red, with amber and Zhuling still around her waist. Her hair was soft from her white neck, against her pale face, and her bright eyes, pure eyes. Zhang Xiaofan even saw her own shadow from there.</p>
<p>Senior sister! A cry in his heart.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan looked at her without even blinking her eyes. If this moment becomes eternity, how good it would be!</p>
<p>In the room, all the people of dazhufeng gathered around. Tian could not easily come forward to check his pulse and nodded his head: &ldquo;OK, it&rsquo;s OK.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All of them are relieved and smile at ease.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan looked around and saw that all the people of dazhufeng were here. He was lying on the bed in the room. All the senior brothers were standing underground. Tian could not easily sit on the chair in front of the bed with Su Ru.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian ling&rsquo;er smiled and said, &ldquo;you won&rsquo;t forget it so soon. During the day, you have a competition with Peng Chang, who is returning to Fenghui peak. When you come back, you faint and scare people. Fortunately, it&rsquo;s OK.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan moved his body. Sure enough, except for some fatigue, he had some pain in his chest. There was nothing else wrong with him. He was surprised and said, &ldquo;how could it be like this? I know it&rsquo;s all on me&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian is not easy to cut: &ldquo;those charred ones are just skin injuries. I&rsquo;ll wipe them with my secret elixir of Qingyun sect. Now you only have a heavy blow on your chest, but the bones, meridians and collaterals are not displaced and vibrated. I&rsquo;ll have a rest for a few days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru, who was sitting beside, smiled and said, &ldquo;Xiaofan, you have not thanked Shifu. If he didn&rsquo;t help you this time, you would have to keep it for at least half a year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was surprised, but his gratitude was still outspoken. In a low voice, he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m incompetent, and it&rsquo;s dragging on master again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian is not easy to hum a, face turn cold, way: &ldquo;where are you incompetent, now dazhufeng is the most capable of you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was surprised again. He didn&rsquo;t know what the meaning of Tian&rsquo;s saying was. He just said: &ldquo;Shifu, I, no, like senior sister, ah, and senior brothers, they are far better than me, I dare not&hellip;&rdquo; he said, but his voice was small. He only looked at all the senior brothers and Tian linger standing in front of him, especially those standing in front of everyone Elder martial brother, I look very pale today. The whole person is not alive as usual. It seems that he is on the verge of falling.</p>
<p>Su Ru sighed and said, &ldquo;Daxin, take a chair for your elder martial brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>LV Daxin answers in a hurry, takes a chair and puts it beside song Daren. Song Daren wanted to refuse, but after shaking his body a few times, he sits down and gasps for breath.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan stared and said, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter with you, elder martial brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren smiled bitterly, but did not speak. On the other hand, he Dazhi, the fourth senior, said: &ldquo;little younger martial brother, now that the seventh pulse has reached the fourth round of martial arts, you are the only one left in Dazhu peak.&rdquo; At this point, he couldn&rsquo;t help looking around.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan stayed for a while, then thought of something, turned to Tian ling&rsquo;er, who was sitting at the head of the bed, and said, &ldquo;elder martial sister, then you&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian ling&rsquo;er looked gloomy and said in a low voice, &ldquo;I also lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan looked at her face in despair and pain, but at this moment, he couldn&rsquo;t bear his thoughts.</p>
<p>Tian is not easy to look up and down at Zhang Xiaofan, sink down face, way: &ldquo;old seven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s heart leaped, only to hear that there was a faint anger in Tian uneasy&rsquo;s words. Seeing that Shifu&rsquo;s face was very ugly, he could not help but feel a little afraid and said, &ldquo;yes, Shifu, what do you have&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without waiting for him to finish, Tian was not easy to stare at Zhang Xiaofan and said decidedly, &ldquo;how did you come from this body of Taoist practice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s head made a loud &ldquo;buzz&rdquo; and his mouth widened. At that time, he did not know how to speak. He looked at all the people in the room one by one, only to see that the familiar and amiable senior brothers kept silent at this time, and there was doubt in their eyes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no wonder that, in a normal day, his stupid little younger martial brother suddenly made a surprise, and no one can accept it in a short time.</p>
<p>Under Tian&rsquo;s aggressive eyes, Zhang Xiaofan was sweating on his forehead. For a moment, he almost blurted out to his master that he practised a different skill behind his back. However, when it came to his mouth, he finally endured it.</p>
<p>He was not the ignorant young man who did not know the world five years ago. In his daily conversation with his senior brother, he had known the great name of Tianyin temple and the real identity of the thin old monk named Puzhi that night. Over the years, he has practiced the Dharma of &ldquo;great Brahma Prajna&rdquo; alone, but in his heart, his gratitude to the general wisdom has never diminished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I, no, I&rsquo;m stupid. I haven&rsquo;t made much progress in cultivating myself in these years.&rdquo; Zhang Xiaofan lowered his head and didn&rsquo;t dare to face the hard eyes of Tian. He said carefully and slowly: &ldquo;some days ago, I suddenly found that I could drive something, but I couldn&rsquo;t believe it. So I dare not report it to Shifu and Shiniang. I didn&rsquo;t expect that&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian is not easy to sneer, way: &ldquo;did not expect this time but amazing, big show off!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan said: &ldquo;no, no, Shifu&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not easy for Tian to deceive the past. He said coldly: &ldquo;you say you can drive things, but this is at least the fourth level of practice in Yuqing realm. I asked Daren, he only passed on your second level of formula. Can you tell me how this ignorant master got around the third level to the fourth level?&rdquo; At the end of his speech, his voice was very cold, and he was a little angry. Everyone turned pale.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan stopped talking and the room was silent.</p>
<p>For a long time, when Tian was not easy to face, and people were worried more and more, Zhang Xiaofan got up silently, and he could see that he was still very tired, but he still struggled to get to the bed, and then in front of the people, under Tian linger&rsquo;s crystal eyes, he knelt down in front of Tian.</p>
<p>The field is not easy not to move at all, cold way: &ldquo;how?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan buries his head deeply. He only looks at the small land near him. He doesn&rsquo;t look at it even once. He whispers, &ldquo;master, please punish me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The crowd shrugged and moved. Tian was not easy to be angry and suddenly changed color. Su Ru frowned and said, &ldquo;Xiaofan, if you have any scruples, tell your master directly. Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan knelt down, motionless.</p>
<p>Tian was not easy to sneer twice. He laughed angrily and said: &ldquo;OK, OK, OK! You are a tough guy, and I have a good disciple! &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s prostrate body trembled, and he didn&rsquo;t know what mood and expression he was in at the moment. There seemed to be someone in the room, whose breath was suddenly short.</p>
<p>Only listening to his low voice, he said: &ldquo;everything is the fault of his disciples. Please punish me, master!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian doesn&rsquo;t easily stand up and chum. The chair under him is split and fell on the ground. Everyone changes color. He says angrily to Zhang Xiaofan, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s all your fault. Hey, you know that it&rsquo;s a big taboo in our Qingyun sect to learn how to steal skills from a teacher. If you are light, you&rsquo;ll have to face the wall for decades. If you are heavy, you&rsquo;ll have to abandon the Taoism to drive Qingyun out. Do you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan raised his head abruptly and looked at Tian hard. He saw that master&rsquo;s face was full of anger, but there was no exaggeration, and his heart sank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could that be?&rdquo; He said a painful sentence in his heart, which was not what Tian ling&rsquo;er said when he handed down his secret formula in private.</p>
<p>However, after all, he did not look back.</p>
<p>There was a dead silence in the room, and no one said a word.</p>
<p>There was only a high or low gasp of anxiety.</p>
<p>A person&rsquo;s heart, just in this silence, so quietly and coldly cold down, as if crazy but so rationally looking at himself, Zhang Xiaofan closed his eyes, lowered his head again, like a desperate person slowly took the last step:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, master, please punish me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bang!&rdquo; A great deal of energy poured in, Zhang Xiaofan flew out backward, hit the wall heavily, fell to the ground in the dust, and breathed a lot of blood.</p>
<p>When the crowd changed color, song Daren forced them to kneel, and all the other disciples knelt down in front of Tian uneasy, saying, &ldquo;master, please forgive me, younger martial brother!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren said: &ldquo;master, I, Keke, I am the one who has no way to teach, so I let younger martial brother do the wrong thing. It&rsquo;s all my fault. Please forgive younger martial brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the crowd&rsquo;s pleading, Tian ling&rsquo;er stood still and stared at Zhang Xiaofan, who was lying in the corner of the wall, struggling painfully and bleeding. His face was white without a trace of blood.</p>
<p>Tian is not easy to look at the disciples kneeling at his feet, but also at Zhang Xiaofan, who is still in the corner of the wall. His face is full of rage and he goes out with a snort. Su Ru took a look at the crowd, shook her head and sighed. She said to song Daren, &ldquo;get up, all of you.&rdquo; Then he looked at Zhang Xiaofan in the distance, and said to song Daren, who was supported by he Dazhi and stood up, &ldquo;go and take care of some Xiaofan, and I will go to see your master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren and others said: &ldquo;yes, Shiniang.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru sighed again and went out.</p>
<p>In the room, people looked at each other. For a while, Tian ling&rsquo;er walked slowly, turned his back to the people, and helped Zhang Xiaofan up. Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s mouth was foaming with blood, lying in her arms, and he even smiled.</p>
<p>At that moment, a drop of cool tears fell quietly into the pool of blood on his face.</p>
<p>　　※※※</p>
<p>At this time, it&rsquo;s already deep in the night. On the sea of clouds, the clouds are still floating, and the beauty is like a fairyland.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not easy for Tian to stand in the square and look up at the sky.</p>
<p>But see the night sky numerous stars, the moon cold frost.</p>
<p>Behind him, there was a familiar sound of footsteps. Su Ru came to him, looked up at the starry sky and said with a faint smile, &ldquo;are you in a better mood?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian can&rsquo;t easily hum, but he doesn&rsquo;t speak.</p>
<p>Su Ru smiled and said, &ldquo;you have cheated Daren and linger, but you can&rsquo;t hide it from me. The power of your sleeve robe is just to shake Xiaofan&rsquo;s chest meridians on purpose so that the blood stasis on his chest can be forced out of his body, right? &quot;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard for Tian to look at the night sky and say nothing.</p>
<p>Su Ru shook her head and said, &ldquo;people who are hundreds of years old, how can they still be such a face dead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian can&rsquo;t easily turn his head and glare at his wife, saying, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t miss it. What does that boy look like,&rdquo; master, please punish me! &quot; He said it in Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s tone, angrily: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s clearly that he was wrong, and he said it in a very aggrieved way. Instead, my Shifu bullied him and forced him to do it? How can it be! &quot;</p>
<p>Su Ru looks back at the direction of the accommodation and says, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you didn&rsquo;t see it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; said Tian</p>
<p>Su Ru said lightly: &ldquo;the appearance of ling&rsquo;er is very strange, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian doesn&rsquo;t sing easily.</p>
<p>Su Ru said with a smile, &ldquo;you can see it. Xiaofan has never been out in dazhufeng in the past five years. It can only be passed on to him by our disciples. Ling&rsquo;er has always been close to Xiao Fan. We pamper her on a regular basis and privately pass the third level of Dharma code to Xiao Fan. I&rsquo;m afraid that I dare to do it.</p>
<p>Besides, if there is no ghost in her heart, she will stand out for Xiaofan in everything in her daily life. This time, she didn&rsquo;t say a word at all? Not her. Who else? &quot;</p>
<p>Tian is not easy to think of his wife&rsquo;s words for a long time, and there is no surprise on his face, but he is still angry and unwilling to say: &ldquo;even if it&rsquo;s ling&rsquo;er&rsquo;s fault, you can see that Zhang Xiaofan, in front of so many disciples, just doesn&rsquo;t say anything to kill me. It&rsquo;s really damned!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru chuckled, patted her husband on the shoulder, and said angrily, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re not the one who knows what&rsquo;s wrong, but also blames other people&rsquo;s children. What&rsquo;s more, Xiao Fan doesn&rsquo;t do it all for the sake of spirit. It&rsquo;s a rare intention! &quot;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not easy for Tian to turn his eyes, but he didn&rsquo;t say anything more.</p>
<p>Su Ru took a look at him and said, &ldquo;how are you going to finish when you are going back? It&rsquo;s a big or small crime to steal art from a teacher. Otherwise, we should not go too far in linger&rsquo;s name. Tomorrow, let Xiaofan go back to dazhufeng and spend thirty or fifty years on the back of the mountain. &quot;</p>
<p>Tian is not easy to Zheng for a while, hum a, but way: &ldquo;finally my disciple just came out one, one&hellip; Strange talent, let him face wall is not cheap Cangsong, Shang Zhengliang them, don&rsquo;t think, tomorrow whether dead or alive, or let him continue to participate in the competition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru smiled at her husband and said with a smile, &ldquo;I know you are hard spoken and soft hearted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian is not easy to fat face unexpectedly red, but immediately returned to normal, looked around, said: &ldquo;old husband and wife, you are not afraid of other people&rsquo;s jokes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru squinted at him, his eyes full of smiles, and said, &ldquo;why, are you afraid of being the first one now? Three hundred years ago, on the peak of Tongtian mountain, when the seven meridians were competing with each other in martial arts, you secretly ran to my residence late at night and called me here. At that time, my master Zhen Yu and her elder martial sister Shuiyue were nearby, and you were not afraid of them! &quot;</p>
<p>Tian said with a smile, &ldquo;your Shifu was really more than 600 years old at that time. I&rsquo;m not afraid of being confused. As for your ferocious elder martial sister, I&rsquo;ve long looked down on her. I want to be alone all my life, but I have to hold you back. I hate her too late. I&rsquo;m not afraid of her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru glared at him and said, &ldquo;you are not allowed to speak ill of my mentor and elder martial sister! They are all very affectionate to me. &quot;</p>
<p>Tian could not easily shrug his shoulders and didn&rsquo;t speak.</p>
<p>In the moonlight, his stout body shakes for a while, which is quite funny. He looks a little complacent. They are very kind to you. You don&rsquo;t mean to marry me.</p>
<p>Su Ru looked at the bottom of her eyes and couldn&rsquo;t help but say, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re old and mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian is not in a good mood. He reaches for his wife&rsquo;s smooth jade hand and walks slowly in the sea of clouds.</p>
<p>　　&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way, I forgot one important thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That stinky boy used a fire stick as a magic weapon, but he still used it. He just forgot to take a look at it in anger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Xiaofan is still self-cultivation. He is afraid that he doesn&rsquo;t know much about the manipulation and application of magic weapons. Do you want to find a time to guide him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s see. Last night, the headmaster and elder martial brother called us several leaders. They said that after communicating with lingzun by channeling, they found that lingzun seemed to act because he felt some evil spirit, but later they could not find it again. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What else can we do? If we can&rsquo;t find it, we can&rsquo;t find it. Lingzun has lived for at least six thousand years. Your master was confused when he was six hundred years old. It&rsquo;s not surprising that lingzun is confused now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>　　“&hellip;&hellip;”</p>
