      <p>Curling up like smoke of white cold, quietly floating in the ice stone room, this day, the cold in the ice stone room seems to be much thicker than usual, even look at the past, there is a bit of hazy feeling, no longer have the past one eye to see the bottom of the clear.</p>
<p>Stone door issued a low roar, in slowly opened, just that into the eyes of the slim figure, but somehow, some appear fuzzy.</p>
<p>Is it you Ji?</p>
<p>GUI Li thought in his heart and walked in slowly. In the cold stone room, the faint cold air drifted away, and the wisps of wisps, like dreams, covered his figure. The figure of that woman, quietly back to him, stood in front of the cold stone platform, and in her body, the cold seemed to be particularly heavy, even that piece of cold condensation of white gas, also like frost and snow general, let people see unreal.</p>
<p>In the air, that looms, reverberates the crisp bell sound, as if near the ear.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why, the ghost Li subconsciously stopped. Xu Shi was somewhat difficult to face today&rsquo;s affairs in the face of Youji, especially after Youji scolded and mentioned Biyao. In retrospect, although GUI Li&rsquo;s heart was somewhat suspicious of the ghost King&rsquo;s abnormal behavior today, he could only be silent about his act of fighting back without thinking about it.</p>
<p>Perhaps, in the hearts of the two men, even have been deeply buried in the meaning of hatred?</p>
<p>However, after all, there is a Biyao in the world. She is lying in the cold stone room.</p>
<p>GUI Li glanced at the figure, which was a little fuzzy and hidden in the cold air. He looked down in silence and said after a long time: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s my fault that I started with the Lord of ghost king just now. I don&rsquo;t know how things suddenly turned into this. Don&rsquo;t get angry. I won&rsquo;t be any more. &quot;</p>
<p>The shoulder of that figure seemed to tremble for a moment, but did not speak, or kept quiet, just the cold air around. It seems that the speed of circulation has become faster, even in this stone chamber, it seems to be a little cold. It&rsquo;s just that the cold stone room is always cold, and the ghost doesn&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>He sighed. He naturally knew the relationship between Youji and Biyao. After the death of Biyao&rsquo;s mother, the ghost King focused on the affairs of Guiwang sect, and Youji was somewhat of a mother of Biyao. This can be seen from the fact that Biyao has always called Youji &ldquo;your aunt.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Now facing her, especially in this cold stone room, GUI Li actually has some real feeling of facing Biyao. However, he is deeply guilty of Biyao. Today, he is fighting with the ghost king, even to the point of life and death, which is more difficult to express.</p>
<p>For a long time, he sighed and said in a low voice, &ldquo;I know that you are heartbroken and don&rsquo;t want to see me and her father have another dispute. In fact, I didn&rsquo;t mean to do that, but at that time&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>He frowned, and the ghost King&rsquo;s abnormal expression flashed through his mind. He shook his head and said, &ldquo;in a word, I promise you that in the future, I will always let him in the face of Biyao.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The slender figure seemed to move again, but still did not turn around, but look at her back, it seems that she nodded silently. It means praise.</p>
<p>He was silent for a moment. He took a breath and didn&rsquo;t want to say anything more. Micro turn around, want to go to that cold stone platform, have a good look at the Biyao.</p>
<p>It was only his steps that he wanted to step out. Suddenly, his whole body was frozen in such an instant, like a flash of lightning. An idea flashed through his mind, like thunder, roaring in his mind.</p>
<p>You Ji usually never leave the body of the masked black gauze, why from behind to see this figure, unexpectedly can&rsquo;t see? Almost at the same time, it was immediately occurred to my mind that the hair style of this figure was just like a girl, which was quite different from the woman in the bun of Youji.</p>
<p>He turned around like an electricity and exclaimed, &ldquo;who are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cold air in the cold stone room is like freezing, and the light smoke shrouded around the back actually began to rotate rapidly in an instant. It was absolutely unacceptable to him that an outsider had intruded into the cold stone room.</p>
<p>When GUI Li was about to move, he suddenly heard a deep roar behind him. Under the uncertainty, he turned his head and saw that the stone gate that had been closed behind him opened slowly, and a figure appeared at the door.</p>
<p>Slim and tall, black veil, temperament quiet, but not you Ji, who is it?</p>
<p>Youji opens the stone gate, but suddenly she sees the ghost. She looks strange on her face, her eyes are wide and her muscles are twisted. On the contrary, she is scared and can&rsquo;t help but step back.</p>
<p>But after all, she was not an ordinary person. She immediately calmed down and said in a cold voice, &ldquo;hum, do you have the face to meet Biyao here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at her deeply, and suddenly his face was startled. He seemed to remember something very important. He turned around and looked at it. However, under this look, he was shocked. He stood in the same place and was speechless.</p>
<p>He was in the place where he was. Suddenly, he completely recovered what he should have been. The strange white smoke disappeared, the faint bell sound disappeared. As for the mysterious figure, he disappeared.</p>
<p>All of them, as if they were the same as before, are like a dream, an illusion, floating, floating</p>
<p>Biyao lies quietly on the cold stone platform, her mouth still has that familiar smile face, her hands close, on the Huan bell flashing light, gently flowing, as if watching the ghost.</p>
<p>Standing in the same place, the whole body was tense, as if all of them had lost consciousness and remained motionless.</p>
<p>Youji, who walked slowly into the ice stone room, soon found something wrong with GUI Li. She looked at him and frowned, &ldquo;what are you doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The corner of his mouth moved, but he didn&rsquo;t speak. He just looked up in silence and stared at the cold stone room. In addition to the heavy stone door, there were hard stone walls around the room, and there were no gaps. At the moment, the cold stone walls seemed to have some cruel ridicule and looked at some ridiculous people coldly.</p>
<p>Wandering eyes, slowly withdraw, slowly back to the cold stone room, lying on the stone platform on the body. GUI Li&rsquo;s eyes, I don&rsquo;t know how, have a bit of fuzzy, thousands of thoughts, such as the tide rush to come, that vision, finally quietly fell on Biyao&rsquo;s hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with you?&rdquo; You Ji&rsquo;s voice, already had a bit impatient.</p>
<p>He closed his eyes. After a long time, he opened it slowly and said in a low voice, &ldquo;did you see something strange in this stone chamber when you came in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>You Ji snorted and said in a cold voice, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the difference? Not as like as two peas. One table, one person. &quot;</p>
<p>The muscles of the corners of his eyes seemed to twitch.</p>
<p>Youji slowly sat down beside Biyao, her eyes showing pity and pity. After a long time, she said slowly, &ldquo;I know you are not so good.</p>
<p>I just want you to think more about how she would feel if she knew you were fighting with her father. &quot;</p>
<p>After a while, he suddenly shook his head, took a long breath and said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t worry, I know what to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, he took a deep look at Biyao, then turned around and strode out.</p>
<p>Look at his back. Youji eyebrows slightly wrinkled, intuitively feel that the ghost is not the same as usual, but then she is again a sigh, strange person, not only he, now is she has been following the ghost King Lord for many years, is not it more and more difficult for her to understand?</p>
<p>She silently bowed her head and fell into meditation. There was only one quiet piece in the cold stone room, only on the Acacia bell in the hands of Biyao. Streamer splendor, flickering brilliance, such as clear eyes, twinkle ceaselessly, gaze at this world.</p>
<p>Qingyunshan. Xiaozhufeng.</p>
<p>In the early morning, there is a breeze blowing slowly, and the green bamboo forest all over the mountain shakes together. The sound of sand and bamboo waves, like the sounds of nature, makes people feel calm. There was a heavy rain last night. If you have washed between the heaven and the earth, the fresh air blows across your face, and the mountains and rivers are picturesque.</p>
<p>At the foot of the stone path is still wet, occasionally in the stone gap, there are some rainwater accumulated last night. On the stone path and on both sides, many fallen bamboo leaves have fallen, which is thought to have been blown down by last night&rsquo;s wind and rain. It&rsquo;s too early to be cleaned.</p>
<p>Dressed in snow, Lu Xueqi walked alone in the bamboo path. In the light of the morning breeze, her hair is soft and smooth on her shoulders, and her skin can be broken by blowing bullets. However, there is a faint pink in the snow white, such as the beautiful flowers blooming quietly in the deep mountains and valleys.</p>
<p>On both sides of the stone path, tall pruning bamboos sway slightly. On the green bamboo leaves, there are condensation dew drops, which glide quietly and fly to the earth.</p>
<p>She stepped forward and never looked back. She walked into the deep green bamboo forest.</p>
<p>The stone path is deep and zigzag, and the bright light of the early morning penetrates through the dense gaps in the bamboo forest, and the bamboo shadow flickers gently, reflecting her graceful posture.</p>
<p>In front of him, a simple bamboo house is gradually emerging. It is the place where the first master of water moon in xiaozhufeng is meditating on his daily life.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi stopped at the door, hesitated for a moment, and patted the bamboo door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master, I&rsquo;ll see you later.</p>
<p>&quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in!&rdquo; Master Shuiyue&rsquo;s voice came from the hut, no joy or sorrow, as if with a little emotion, light as water.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi opened the door with a squeak. Lu Xueqi went in and saw her sitting cross legged on the bamboo bed. She closed her eyes and was calm. She could not see any change in her expression because of her arrival.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi went to master Shuiyue in silence, knelt down and said in a low voice, &ldquo;master, here comes the disciple.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a pause, she went on to say, &ldquo;Xueqi knows that she is not good. She has failed to live up to your expectations. She has made you sad. Please punish me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue slowly opened his eyes, and his eyes fell on Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s body in front of him. After a long time of gaze, he sighed and said, &ldquo;if I punish you, will you change your mind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi lowered her head in silence. She didn&rsquo;t dare to look at her face. She didn&rsquo;t say a word. She just looked at her expression, but where did she have the slightest regret?</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue shook his head and said with a wry smile, &ldquo;since you are iron hearted and refuse to turn back, what&rsquo;s the use of punishing you. Get up! &quot;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi bit her lower lip slightly. She seemed to be excited, but she still controlled herself and stood up.</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue patted the bamboo bed beside him and said, &ldquo;you can sit down too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi shook her head and said, &ldquo;I dare not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue looked at her and said, &ldquo;there are only two of us here. What can I do for you? Do you hate me as a master. Are you separated from me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi suddenly raised her head and quickly shook her head: &ldquo;master, I&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue waved his hand and said with a smile: &ldquo;OK, OK, you are my one-hand education. I don&rsquo;t know what kind of temperament you are. '</p>
<p>She stretched out her hand to hold Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s hand, gently pulled her over and sat beside her. She took a close look at Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s beautiful and elegant face. With a sigh, he said, &ldquo;no matter what, I&rsquo;m a master for you. You should remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s mouth moved.</p>
<p>In a low voice, &ldquo;what I understand is actually the disciple&rsquo;s fault&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue shook his head and said, &ldquo;forget it, now that we don&rsquo;t have to argue about who is right and who is wrong. What is love in the world? Snow in the evening But who can be with us for a lifetime? &quot;</p>
<p>At this point, it seems that master Shuiyue himself has touched his mind, and he is in a trance.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi did not dare to disturb her master. She just felt the master holding her hand. The warmth that came from her palm was familiar for a long time.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how long after that, master Shuiyue suddenly woke up from his trance and laughed bitterly. He said to Lu Xueqi, &ldquo;well, let&rsquo;s talk about these things later. I asked Wen Min to call you here last night. Did she tell you all about it? &quot;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi shook her head and said, &ldquo;elder martial sister didn&rsquo;t say anything. She just told me to come to see Master in the morning and say something. Master, you will tell me. &quot;</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue nodded silently and said, &ldquo;yes, Wenmin knows something about it, but it&rsquo;s not much. Let me tell you about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s heart slightly shakes, looking at the water moon master&rsquo;s face a bit heavy. There seems to be something difficult in my heart, and I can&rsquo;t help saying, &ldquo;master, is there anything difficult? If you need a disciple, please tell me, and I will try my best to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue nodded and said with a smile: &ldquo;of course I believe you, but there is a big event at present, which is related to the strength of Qingyun sect. However, we can&rsquo;t let too many outsiders know about it, including our disciples. I want to think about it. Among the disciples, you are the only one with the best ability of Taoism and handling affairs, so I called you here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi raised her eyebrows and was slightly surprised and said, &ldquo;master, is something important happened in our school?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue gave a wry smile and said, &ldquo;who says it&rsquo;s not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi said, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter, master?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue pondered for a moment and seemed to be pondering over it. Then he said slowly, &ldquo;your master and master Tian Buyi of dazhufeng have disappeared together a few days ago.</p>
<p>&quot;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi was shocked and said, &ldquo;are they missing together?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue said, &ldquo;on that day, some elder disciples saw that Tian was not easy to come to tongtianfeng, and went straight to the ancestral hall of Houshan. Since then, everyone knows that the headmaster and senior brother are in the ancestral hall, and since then, no one has seen them again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi frowned, obviously very surprised.</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue pauses for a moment, and then says: &ldquo;after this incident, because of the great relationship, Xiao Yi, who is in charge of Tongtian peak, dare not cover it up. However, she does not dare to publicize it in any case. She only secretly informs our leaders. After that, I went to the ancestral hall to check it, but I didn&rsquo;t expect that it had already&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi was stunned and said, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s wrong with the ancestral hall?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue shook his head and said, &ldquo;almost all the halls of the ancestral hall have been destroyed. You can see at a glance that it was destroyed by the power of fierce fighting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Lu Xueqi cried softly.</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue sneered and said, &ldquo;the ancestral hall is the place where our Qingyun gate worships our ancestors. It&rsquo;s really lawless for them to dare to fight in such a solemn boundary. And there are more serious things. &quot;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi was surprised. She couldn&rsquo;t think of anything more serious than the destruction of the ancestral temple. She couldn&rsquo;t help asking, &ldquo;what else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yesterday, Xiao Yicai ran to me in a hurry.&rdquo; master Shuiyue&rsquo;s face became dignified, and his eyes became more worried. He said slowly, &ldquo;according to him, since senior brother daoxuan disappeared, he tried his best to find out what he had left behind. He wanted to find out what he found. Unexpectedly, he found a big event.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi stares at master Shuiyue.</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue closed her eyes as if she was a little tired and said, &ldquo;Xiao Yi found out that the ancient sword for killing immortals in our school has disappeared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi was stunned and speechless.</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue opened his eyes and said, &ldquo;I know that you are a wise man. Naturally, you know the relationship and mystery. Although the ancient sword of Zhuxian has been damaged, it has a lot to do with it. Moreover, most outsiders do not know about the damage. If it is spread out, it will be very troublesome. Besides, there is a big secret in Zhuxian ancient sword, which is more important than me Few people, such as the leader of Qingyun gate, know that if it is leaked out, the consequences will be unimaginable.</p>
<p>&quot;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi exclaimed, &ldquo;is there any secret to Zhuxian sword except that it&rsquo;s our magic weapon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue was silent for a long time. Lu Xueqi did not dare to speak. She stood aside with her hands down and murmured: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m rude. I just lost my manners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue shook his head in silence. For a long time, he said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean to blame you. It&rsquo;s just that there is a lot of relationship here, and the context is extremely complicated&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>When she said this, she stopped for a moment, as if pondering. After a moment, she said: &ldquo;in fact, according to the truth, even I, the head of xiaozhufeng, can&rsquo;t know. It&rsquo;s because of the great chaos a hundred years ago, a few of us unexpectedly learned something about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi said in dismay: &ldquo;a few people, are there any other people who know such a big secret besides Shifu?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue said: &ldquo;in the chaos, there were five people who participated in the chaos. Besides me, there were elder martial brother daoxuan, Tian Buyi and younger sister Su Ru&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi was listening. When she heard master Shuiyue stop, she could not help saying, &ldquo;master, there are only four people here. Is there another one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue sighed, a trace of melancholy passed on his face and said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a master of yours, named Wan Jian Yi.&rdquo; (to be continued. )</p>
