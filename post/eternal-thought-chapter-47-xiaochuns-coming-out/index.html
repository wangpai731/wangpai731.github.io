      <p>In the morning, when the first ray of sunlight fell, Bai Xiaochun felt the vibration of his identity token. Standing outside his yard, he looked back at his house, which had lived for more than two years, and sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must be careful during this trip. You can&rsquo;t lose your life&hellip;&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun put on seven or eight leather clothes and carried Zhang Da Pang&rsquo;s black pot on his back. He was thin and small, but now he looks like a ball.</p>
<p>With a heavy heart, Bai Xiaochun left Xiangyun mountain and headed for the gate on the south bank. Many disciples of other schools saw him on the way and were stunned by Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s disguise.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun was sad. If he met an acquaintance, he would wave goodbye and gradually arrived at the gate on the south bank. As soon as he approached, he saw two people there. One of them was a young man sitting cross legged and the other was a woman. Looking at her back, Bai Xiaochun felt a little familiar. At the moment, she was walking impatiently around the mountain gate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Du Lingfei?&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun is stunned.</p>
<p>At the moment, Du Lingfei also saw Bai Xiaochun, and she was stunned for a moment, especially when she found that Bai Xiaochun was so dressed up, she frowned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it you who will investigate the missing mission of senior brother Hou?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s me. What a coincidence&hellip;&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun gave a dry cough, and her eyes seemed to sweep at the youth beside Du Lingfei. The young man had no expression, but there was some evil spirit in his body. When Bai Xiaochun looked at him, he opened his eyes and looked at Bai Xiaochun like a smile.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s heart moved. Before he came, he had already analyzed how Qian Dajin would act in this mission. The simplest thing was to find a fellow disciple who was also performing the task. After being far away from the clan, he would make a secret move, so that he could not be aware of it.</p>
<p>At the moment, no matter Du Lingfei or the young man, Bai Xiaochun is doubting at the bottom of his heart, but on the surface, he will not show up, and even laughs at the young man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Bai Xiaochun. I don&rsquo;t know if elder martial brother is&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mount Qingfeng, Feng Yan.&rdquo; The young man laughed and spoke slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It turned out to be elder martial brother Feng, who was very unusual at first sight. I went out on a mission for the first time, and I hope elder martial brother Feng will carry more of them.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun quickly clasped his fist, and realized that the other party&rsquo;s accomplishments were in the seventh layer of condensate gas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Easy to say, easy to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Feng yanmu&rsquo;s slight contempt swept away. The reason why he took part in the task was that his inner disciple Qian Dajin made a promise to him, which made him extremely excited. He agreed to kill Bai Xiaochun in the execution of the task.</p>
<p>For him, it&rsquo;s very simple. He doesn&rsquo;t even need to direct his own hand. A little bit of a stumbling block can make Bai Xiaochun die by accident.</p>
<p>The only thing that needs to be noted is that it is not easy for Du Lingfei to see it. However, in his opinion, since Du Lingfei is involved in this task, it is obviously also the promotion of Qian Dajin.</p>
<p>Du Lingfei frowned. She didn&rsquo;t expect to go out to carry out the task, but she could meet the disgusting guy in front of her. This time, the task was not imposed on her by others, but she took the initiative. After all, although the task was dangerous, it was still simple in general, and its contribution was not poor.</p>
<p>She was stuck in the fifth layer of condensate gas for a long time. If she wants to get enough contribution points, she can get another lingyunxiang to break through. When she thinks of lingyunxiang, she is even more disgusted with Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As timid as a mouse!&rdquo; When he saw the other side&rsquo;s back, he was even more disgusted with the black ball.</p>
<p>Now cold hum a, no longer pay attention to Bai Xiaochun, toward Feng Yan a fist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elder martial brother Feng, we are all here. Please take out the sails and finish the task early, so as to come back as soon as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Feng Yan smile, right hand patted the storage bag, immediately a white light fly out, windward see good, soon in the air into a two Zhang long white boat.</p>
<p>The waves of spiritual power scattered from the boat, forming a strong pressure, which was quite impressive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is this, senior brother Feng?&rdquo; When Bai Xiaochun looked at it, he saw it for the first time, especially when he saw the boat floating in the air. He felt that it was extraordinary to see the boat floating in the air.</p>
<p>Du Lingfei&rsquo;s eyes showed contempt, while Feng Yan on one side laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a sailing sail. If we go out to perform a mission, if we go to a distant place, zongmen will rent us this kind of boat. We don&rsquo;t need to consume too much spiritual power to control it. It&rsquo;s very convenient to use, but it costs a lot of spirit stone.&rdquo; Feng Yan said, jumping up and falling into the boat.</p>
<p>Du Lingfei followed, and Bai Xiaochun jumped on the boat. The boat was not big, and there was not much space in it. However, it was more than enough to accommodate three people. Bai Xiaochun sat at the back of the boat, touched here and looked at the other side, and felt that it was a good thing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After me, I&rsquo;ll get another one.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun said to himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you sell yourself, you can&rsquo;t afford it!&rdquo; Du Lingfei looked at Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s appearance of a pair of earth bumpkins and began to sneer.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun squints at Du Lingfei and nods at the smell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I sell you, I think I can buy it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You Du Lingfei&rsquo;s Phoenix eyes glared. Just as she was about to open her mouth, Fengyan&rsquo;s control turned windsurfing into a rainbow and ran straight to the far horizon.</p>
<p>The speed was so fast that the sound of howling was raised. However, there was a light curtain rising to block the strong wind. Although Bai Xiaochun could hear the wind outside in the boat, they would not feel uncomfortable.</p>
<p>From a distance, the boat rainbow gradually disappeared in the horizon.</p>
<p>At the same time, in Xiangyun mountain, in the pharmacist&rsquo;s hall, the elder Xu, who was in charge of the examination of the promotion of pharmacists, held a jade slip in his hand and frowned slightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The law enforcement hall has bypassed Xiangyun mountain and forced Bai Xiaochun to carry out the task?&rdquo; Elder Xu looked at the jade slips carefully. After a long time, his eyebrows relaxed. He saw that the task was simple. Although it was dangerous, it would not hurt his life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This son is lazy and used to it. A little punishment is OK.&rdquo; Elder Xu thought of Li Qinghou&rsquo;s advice before leaving and the character of Bai Xiaochun, so he put down the jade slips and continued to refine medicine.</p>
<p>At the same time, Qian Dajin stood outside one of the caves on Qingfeng mountain, where the disciples of the inner gate were located. Looking at the distant boat, Qian Dajin had a grim smile on his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With Feng Yan&rsquo;s accomplishments, it&rsquo;s easy to kill Bai Xiaochun secretly. Bai Xiaochun It&rsquo;s a pity that you don&rsquo;t have the possibility to grow up. This time, you will die! &quot; Deep in Qian Dajin&rsquo;s eyes, a touch of cold flashed by, and with a smile, he turned back to the cave.</p>
<p>The blue sky is like washing, and the blue waves are thousands of miles. On this boat, although Bai Xiaochun is nervous, she can&rsquo;t help but feel excited when she sees the earth become small under her feet.</p>
<p>When he looked down, he could see mountains like swords and mountains like dragons, especially one Earth shaking river!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tongtian River&hellip;&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun took a deep breath. After he became a foreign disciple, he looked through a lot of materials and knew that the whole cultivation world actually relied on this river to practice.</p>
<p>This river is the root of all aura.</p>
<p>Therefore, every sect will be built near the Tongtian River, and the higher the upper reaches, the stronger the aura.</p>
<p>The place where lingxizong is located can only be regarded as the middle reaches. However, it can still stand for ten thousand years. According to the materials Bai Xiaochun saw, the Lingxi sect ten thousand years ago was not here, but in the downstream. It was a marvelous ancestor. He was born and killed from the countless clans and Xiuzhen families in the lower and lower reaches, and gained the appreciation of the upper sect. Only in this way can we open up in the middle reaches The qualification of the clan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is said that at the upper reaches of the Tongtian River, the power of the sect can not be compared by several Lingxi sects. However, at the source, it is said that There are more terrifying clans. &quot; Bai Xiaochun suppressed the agitation in his heart. He was on the alert when he went out at the moment.</p>
<p>The Tongtian River is not far below. The river is golden and constantly rolling like the sea. On the other side of the river, there are four peaks soaring into the sky, with amazing aura.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That should be the North Bank of lingxizong.&rdquo; Looking at the four peaks on the north bank, Bai Xiaochun saw the main peak of lingxizong, the bridge mountain formed across Tongtian River!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plant daoshan!&rdquo; When Bai Xiaochun was brought by Li Qinghou, he also saw these things. However, at that time, he was still a mortal, but now he is a disciple of a foreign school. When he looked at it again, he felt quite different.</p>
<p>Boat speed, gradually away from the zongmen, down the rolling passage of the Tongtian River, straight downstream to fly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sister Du and younger martial brother Bai, you must have seen the mission. The place we are going to this time is in the Luoxing mountain range at the lower reaches of Tongtian River. The last time Hou sent a message was there. This Luoxing mountain range is the boundary of our Lingxi sect&rsquo;s sphere of influence, and the other end of the mountain range is the scope of Xuexi clan.&rdquo; Feng Yan spoke faintly, and his voice was confused by the wind in the boat, which was a little vague.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This trip may be dangerous to a certain extent, but I have been prepared for the next task, so as long as we are more cautious, there will be no big obstacle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just that the place we&rsquo;re going to is too far away, and the spiritual stone consumption is not small, so we&rsquo;d better walk most of the time, and take this boat to walk in some places that are difficult to cross.&rdquo; After Feng Yan finished, there was a flash of cold light in the deep of his eyes. He sat in front of him and closed his eyes to meditate.</p>
<p>Du Lingfei doesn&rsquo;t want to pay attention to Bai Xiaochun. She leans on the edge and spits in the same way.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun is quite alert in his heart. Although he meditates with his knees crossed, he is always thinking about who is Qian Dajin&rsquo;s sending the two people in front of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Du Lingfei is the least likely Then Feng Yan, in all likelihood, is him! &quot;</p>
