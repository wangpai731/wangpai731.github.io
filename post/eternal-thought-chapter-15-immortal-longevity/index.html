      <p>Go to &ldquo;small talk → net&rdquo; to provide you with wonderful novels to read. A kind of Go to &ldquo;small talk → net&rdquo; to provide you with wonderful novels to read.</p>
<p>The moon is bright and falls on Lingxi zongxiangyun mountain, diluting some clouds and fog, making the whole mountain show more than half of the whole mountain, which looks like a unique beauty.</p>
<p>At the east of the mountain, at the end of a forked mountain road, there is a yard. The yard is about the size of a mu, surrounded by plants and flowers, which is very unique. There is a wooden house in the yard. No matter the tables, chairs and beds in the yard are made of dark purple wood, which gives off light sandalwood, which is far from comparable to the service area.</p>
<p>In the courtyard outside the wooden house, there is also a cultivated field and a well in the corner. Now in the moonlight, Bai Xiaochun looks around with satisfaction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The outer disciples are already recognized by Lingxi sect. Naturally, their treatment is much better than that of the laborers. This single family house is really good. But I heard the elder martial brother say that if you can become an inner disciple, you can live in the cave I don&rsquo;t know what the cave looks like Bai Xiaochun looks up to the top of the mountain.</p>
<p>Only inner disciples are qualified to live in the upper part of Xiangyun mountain.</p>
<p>After a while, he took back his eyes, stretched out a stretch in the wooden house, took out the storage bag, and patted it gently. In front of him, there was a bottle of elixir and a green fragrance in front of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good stuff.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun couldn&rsquo;t let go of the storage bag. For a long time, his eyes fell on the Dan bottle and the green fragrance. There was a label on the bottle, which said &ldquo;Ning Ling&rdquo;. As for Qingxiang, the word &ldquo;Shengqing&rdquo; was engraved on it. When he was a general servant, he had obtained similar things. After swallowing, his accomplishments were increased. As for the incense, he ignited it and breathed in smoke, which was the same as that of the elixir.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a waste to swallow like this. It&rsquo;s better to use it after soul refining. Maybe it can break through the bottleneck of my cultivation.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun thought for a moment and made a decision. However, there was no wood of the same color. He was going down the mountain to make some during the day.</p>
<p>Thinking of this, Bai Xiaochun meditated and began to practice. Bai Xiaochun never gave up the practice. Even though the progress was slow during this period of time, she still persisted for a period of time every day.</p>
<p>He practiced for the sake of long life, so he was quite persistent in his practice.</p>
<p>After a night&rsquo;s silence, the morning glow fell in the morning and melted into the fog, which made the bright light in the fog reflect waves of brilliance. Bai Xiaochun was full of energy after opening his eyes, put on the clothes of the disciples of other schools, and quickly walked out of the wooden house. According to the position handed in by elder martial brother Hou yesterday, Bai Xiaochun went to the Tibetan Scripture Pavilion.</p>
<p>The Sutra Pavilion is a little far away from where he lives. On the other side of the mountain, after walking for half an hour, he can see a tall tower from afar. The light is flowing, and there are bursts of pressure from inside, covering all sides.</p>
<p>On the way, I met many disciples from other schools. Most of them were in a hurry. After perceiving Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s cultivation of three layers of condensation gas here, he ignored them directly.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun didn&rsquo;t mind, but he was more cautious in his steps. All the external disciples he met along the way were all above him. There were even a few people who gave him an unfathomable feeling. They were surrounded by many disciples and walked by him with laughter.</p>
<p>The closer we get to the Sutra Pavilion, the more disciples there will be. Bai Xiaochun is about to get close to it. Just then, a long rainbow comes from a distant mountain peak, makes a circle around Xiangyun mountain and goes straight to the horizon.</p>
<p>Changhong can be seen indistinctly, inside is a young man, stepping on a wheel under the foot, the speed is very fast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Qian Dajin from law enforcement hall, senior brother Qian!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As an inner disciple, elder martial brother Qian joined the law enforcement hall. He is famous. It is said that he has reached the eighth level of condensate gas. He can fly with magic weapons in a short time, which is enviable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun also looked at the past with admiration, until the other party disappeared in the horizon, which was the inner feeling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I can fly one day, I will fly around Xiangyun mountain a few times every day when there are many people!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun looks forward to shuttling the crowd to the Sutra Pavilion.</p>
<p>The tower is very large. The first floor is empty. There is only a table, and an old man sits in meditation with his eyes closed. Every disciple passing by will put his identity token on the table, waiting for a flash of light to pass by respectfully.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun walked over and put the token on the table. Soon, the token flashed. He quickly picked it up and followed his elder martial brother up the stairs to the second floor of the Sutra Pavilion.</p>
<p>There are many shelves with rows of jade slips and occasionally some bamboo books. Each of them is covered with soft light, which makes the second floor of the Sutra Pavilion look very good.</p>
<p>There is a staircase not far away. Bai Xiaochun looks around and walks to the stairs. When she is about to go up, a light curtain appears and bounces him back.</p>
<p>One side of a word eyebrow of the youth is looking at the bamboo book, aware of this behind the scenes looked up at Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elder martial brother, what qualifications do you need to go to the third floor?&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun put on a clever appearance and asked curiously to the young man with one eyebrow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a new disciple. You can go there only when you are on the fifth floor of condensate gas.&rdquo; Young people light mouth, no longer say, bow to read bamboo books.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun knew that he didn&rsquo;t want to be disturbed, so he stopped trying to go to the third floor. Instead, he wandered around on the second floor. Sometimes he picked up jade slips, sometimes looked at some bamboo books, and looked at the various skills inside. He was very excited.</p>
<p>In particular, there is a fire way inside, which makes him feel good.</p>
<p>After a while, he found the jade slips of Ziqi yudinggong, which contained patterns and pithy formulas from the fourth to the eighth layers. He quickly took it in his hand, and Bai Xiaochun continued to walk.</p>
<p>Time goes by, and soon it&rsquo;s almost dusk outside. Bai Xiaochun is on the second floor, and only 70% of the area is completed. There are a lot less people around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are seven or eight that look good&hellip;&rdquo; When he was still trying to decide which one to choose, he picked up a bamboo book. The bamboo book was a bit broken, but Bai Xiaochun just took a look at it, and his eyes were full of excitement and excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Immortality and longevity work!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took a deep breath and looked at the introduction of this skill carefully. He knew that it was a skill of cultivating body. If he could achieve great success, it seemed that it could make people immortal.</p>
<p>He was short of breath, looked at the name of the skill, and immediately decided to choose it!</p>
<p>He practiced for the sake of long life. Seeing this skill, he felt that he was destined for the skill. He laughed and went down the stairs with the bamboo book.</p>
<p>In the hall on the first floor, the old man still closed his eyes after the case, which was no different from that in the morning. But when Bai Xiaochun put the jade slips of Ziqi controlling Ding Gong and the bamboo script of immortal immortal life on record, his eyes slowly opened and glanced at Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>At this glance, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s body was shocked. He felt that the other party&rsquo;s eyes were like lightning, which made people shudder after seeing it. Bai Xiaochun quickly looked respectful.</p>
<p>Fortunately, soon the old man took back his eyes and looked at Xiaochun&rsquo;s identity token.</p>
<p>&ldquo;New disciples can make a rubbing of the first eight layers of Ziqi Yuding skill, and can also choose an additional skill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man spoke faintly, and his voice was hoarse. As he was saying this, his eyes fell on the bamboo book of immortality changshenggong, and his brow slightly frowned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Although the description of this skill is amazing, there are only fragments. Moreover, it is very difficult to practice. The pain is very unbearable. Few of the disciples in the past have successfully practiced it, and most of them give up. They have been put in the Sutra Pavilion for a long time. Are you sure you want to practice this skill?&rdquo; The old man looks at Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master, I&rsquo;m very sure!&rdquo; When Bai Xiaochun listened to the old man&rsquo;s words, he had a great sense of this skill. He had been here for so many years just to wait for his own feeling. Especially when he thought of the four words &ldquo;Immortality&rdquo;, he suddenly had the meaning of blood burning, so he spoke quickly.</p>
<p>The old man stopped persuading him. With a wave of his right hand, two blank jade slips flew out immediately. After rubbing, they fell in front of Bai Xiaochun, and they ignored it and closed their eyes again.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun put away the jade slips. With expectation in her eyes, she turned and left, walked out of the Sutra Pavilion and went directly back to the courtyard.</p>
<p>When he came back, it was late. In the wooden house, Bai Xiaochun meditated with his knees crossed. After taking a deep breath, he took out the jade slips of immortal longevity work. He used his aura to blend into the jade slips. His eyes closed and his mind suddenly came up with the resolution of this skill.</p>
<p>Half an hour later, Bai Xiaochun opened her eyes and thought.</p>
<p>As the old man said, this immortal life skill is just a remnant. It is introduced that the cultivation of this skill can be divided into internal and external exercises, among which the external exercise is divided into skin, meat and tendon.</p>
<p>Internal refining is bone and blood.</p>
<p>In this chapter, there is only skin cultivation, and it seems that it is really very difficult to practice. In addition, it also mentions the practice of this method, which consumes a lot. However, it introduces several kinds of secret methods, which seem to be a little exaggerated. For example, one of the secret methods is called broken throat lock, which is invincible.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun hesitated for a moment, but when he saw the four words of immortality, he immediately showed his determination. According to the introduction of the skill, he got up and raised his hands, constantly patting the whole body everywhere.</p>
<p>He has indescribable persistence in immortality and immortality, which is much more than that of ordinary people. At the moment, his practice is also the same. According to the requirements of the martial arts, he took a whole night&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p>Until the next day, his whole body tingled. He didn&rsquo;t stand or sit. Even when his arm was raised, he felt terrible pain. But he still gnawed his teeth and did his best to move his body according to the skill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ouch First loose, then tight Ah, ah, oh If it is tight, loosen it again! &quot; Bai Xiaochun read a sentence from the immortal longevity work. She was jumping in the yard, screaming and crying. Her tears were coming out. Finally, she took the spirit stone out of the yard and went down the mountain.</p>
<p>He thought that since he wanted to do some activities, he simply went down the mountain to buy Herbs for longevity pills, which was better than the simple exercise in the yard.</p>
<p>So, on the Xiangyun mountain that day, many disciples were surprised to see a white and pure young man. He had a strange body all the way, and sometimes he even made a cry. It was quite enchanting to hear from a distance</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, ah, oh, oh, oh, ah Ah Ah Ah&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun didn&rsquo;t want to cry out, but it was too painful. The pain made him feel tormented even if he didn&rsquo;t move. However, whenever he thought of the four words of immortality, he became cruel and walked all the way from the mountain to the market outside zongmen.</p>
<p>After shaking and buying enough herbs there, he bought some wood of the same color fire. As for the wood of the second color fire, the price was very high, so he only bought one piece and his pocket was empty.</p>
<p>This just bite teeth to come back, went to the mission, completed the task he took in the miscellaneous service, in exchange for a longevity pill.</p>
<p>The pill is the size of a thumb cover. It is yellow in color and has a strange fragrance. Looking at the pill, Bai Xiaochun is unable to speak with pain, and her body is soaked with sweat beads.</p>
<p>With his teeth clenched, Bai Xiaochun climbed the steps of Xiangyun mountain step by step, leaving behind a lot of sweat stains. After seeing him all the way, many of his disciples showed surprise and some even showed disgust. After all, Bai Xiaochun had too much sweat on him.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t know how he survived. When he walked back to the hospital step by step, it was late at night. When he stepped into the yard, he directly fell down and fainted in pain.</p>
<p>That night, even in a coma, he woke up with pain several times, until after dawn, when he opened his eyes, the pain in his whole body disappeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is an incomplete small cycle&hellip;&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun thought of the introduction of immortal longevity work. Such a day and night without coma can be regarded as a complete small cycle, and such a small cycle needs 9981 times before it can be regarded as a small week. It is just like transforming the skin. After a certain degree of skin toughness, it will not be so painful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If this skill is simple and everyone can practice it, will not everyone be able to live forever. The more so, the more I will practice. If I continue to practice like this, I will surely live forever!&rdquo; White small pure eyes show resolute, his obsession for longevity, can be said to be to a shocking degree.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of the pain at the moment, Bai Xiaochun took out the longevity pill. After carefully looking at it, he was about to eat it. But soon he remembered something. He looked around quickly to make sure that no one was there. He quickly ran back to the wooden house, pinched the key with his right hand, and immediately the turtle shaped pot appeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bit of a loss. It&rsquo;s better to eat after refining.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun licked his lips, took out the wood of the two colors fire, lit it and put it under the turtle pattern pot. Immediately, the wood burned rapidly and turned into ashes in a blink of an eye. The two lines on the turtle pattern pot lit up.</p>
<p>He hesitated and put the elixir in the pot. Almost at the moment when the elixir fell into the pot, the silver glittered in an instant. Bai Xiaochun had the experience, but his look remained unchanged. He could not blink his eyes.</p>
<p>After a while, the silver awn disappeared. On the longevity elixir in the pot, there were two silver lines, and a smell of medicine that was much stronger than before was immediately released, which made people feel refreshed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity that we can&rsquo;t find the fuel for the tricolor fire.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun picks up the elixir and throws it directly into the mouth. The elixir melts in the mouth and forms a boiling heat, which diffuses directly in Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun only felt the sound of his mind. His body was like a furnace. All of them were burning. The white hair on his forehead turned black to black with the naked eye. There was a feeling in his body as if his vitality had been replenished. Even after a while, the feeling was not reduced, but even more intense. Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s nostrils left nosebleed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s made up!&rdquo; He opened his eyes and quickly practiced the purple Qi controlling tripod skill, but it was not of much use. After all, the miraculous medicine was not aura, but vitality. His nose blood was flowing more and more, and the heat flow in his body was expanding at the moment. He felt as if he had become a ball and was about to explode. He was immediately shocked.</p>
<p>In fact, after being refined twice, the effect of this miraculous medicine is far better than before, and its value is much more than before. The cultivation of Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s three layers of condensate is simply unbearable.</p>
<p>At the moment of crisis, Bai Xiaochun suddenly remembered the immortal longevity work, and quickly jumped up, hands on the body with all their strength, quickly patted.</p>
<p>The sound of bang bang reverberated. With the recording, the heat flow in his body appeared the sense of dredging. Bai Xiaochun did not dare to stay. After half an hour, the heat flow in his body completely dissipated. He fell down immediately, panting for breath, but his spirit was better than ever before, and his eyes flashed with more intense light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Although it has something to do with soul refining, it is a panacea, a panacea How amazing Some can increase aura, some can increase longevity Is there a medicine that can make people live forever The more she thought about it, the more excited she was, and her eyes were brighter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Xiangyun mountain is to train pharmacists&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to be a pharmacist and refine one Immortal Dan Bai Xiaochun is short of breath, and her heart is in this moment. She has an unprecedented persistence in the miraculous medicine.</p>
