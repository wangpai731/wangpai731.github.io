      <p>Bai Xiaochun is even more aggrieved. He has found that he always makes a fool of himself every time he meets the need to explain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not his intention. He doesn&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>Beihanlie&rsquo;s elder brother, beihanfeng, was also explained by Bai Xiaochun. After taking a deep breath, his right hand actually appeared bursts of black light at this moment. In the blink of an eye, a black crescent moon appeared in his palm!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the moon after sunset, but the black moon sends out the power of fear that shakes people&rsquo;s mind, and presses it directly towards Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s cave array.</p>
<p>With a bang, the whole cave trembled a few times. The array outside the cave was strongly distorted. There were even signs of fragmentation in many places, but finally Still did not collapse, and even recovered in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>In this scene, even the north cold wind took a breath. The strength of the cave array made him feel extremely headache. At the moment, he gritted his teeth and was about to continue to fight.</p>
<p>But at this time, a cold hum came from the distant sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;North cold wind, what are you doing? Don&rsquo;t stop!&rdquo; This sound is like thunder, directly in the north side of the cold wind burst, roaring at the same time, also will north cold strong earthquake not crazy, scared quickly back.</p>
<p>The inner disciples of sunset peak all around changed their faces one by one. They all stood back and stopped. Looking up at the sky, they saw six long rainbow galloping from Zhongdao mountain in the distance.</p>
<p>It was one of the middle-aged men who roared out that sentence. He was wearing a black robe with a square face and angry eyes. The whole person emitted a breath of destruction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master&hellip;&rdquo; Beihanlie and beihanfeng were shaken by the roar of the middle-aged man. They immediately paid a visit to them. All the other disciples of sunset peak were shaking and bowed their heads together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See you, Palmer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This middle-aged man, who is the master of beihanlie, is Tianjiao&rsquo;s wartime. He stares at Bai Xiaochun fiercely and holds the palm seat of sunset peak, where beihanlie left.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t make a good thing, you should throw it away. I&rsquo;ll clean you up later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you wait. After you go back, everyone will be shut up for three years as punishment!&rdquo; The middle-aged man said angrily. The two brothers were trembling. Some of them didn&rsquo;t know what had happened. Although they came here in violation of the rules, they had always been very kind to their master. They should not be so angry. After all, the master was very angry with Bai Xiaochun on that day.</p>
<p>The two brothers felt that they didn&rsquo;t know what had happened. When they stepped back, they looked at the master in the sky. They felt even more numb. Beside the palm of sunset peak, there were palms of three other mountains on the north bank, especially the old lady of the palm of iris peak. They looked at the disciples of sunset peak coldly.</p>
<p>In addition to the four palm seats on the north bank, the headmaster Zheng Yuandong is also among them. There is another person who looks indifferent, as if he does not care about the disputes among the disciples below. He is Xiangyun mountain palm seat, Li Qinghou.</p>
<p>Not only the disciples of sunset peak felt bad, but the inner disciples of Xiangyun mountain were also surprised. They all felt that the scene was a little strange You should know that the north bank has always been arrogant, such as today&rsquo;s events, it has happened several times in the past, each time the north bank side of the big things, small things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s rare to be so angry like today.</p>
<p>Even Bai Xiaochun in the cave was stunned for a moment and looked curiously at the people outside the cave.</p>
<p>In mid air, the palms of the four peaks on the north bank looked at each other. After seeing each other, the old woman of iris peak coughed and looked at Li Qinghou.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Li, according to what we discussed before, you can see&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be all right if there were no mistakes. Now I&rsquo;m in a dilemma. You can talk about it yourself.&rdquo; Li Qinghou shook his head and spoke faintly. His eyes swept the cave of Bai Xiaochun below his eyes. There was a smile in his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo; The old woman of iris peak hesitated for a moment. Some of her headache looked at the middle-aged man of sunset peak. The palm seat of sunset peak sighed deeply. She knew that the trouble was caused by her disciples here, so she had to solve it by herself. She had a smile on her face and looked at Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s cave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Younger martial brother Xiaochun&hellip;&rdquo; After he said these four words, he felt very uncomfortable. The whole person was not good, but he could not help it. After the four peaks on the north bank discussed with each other, Bai Xiaochun attached great importance to the hair and love pills of Bai Xiaochun, and even studied the war animals. He came to the conclusion that even the first blood vessels could be affected.</p>
<p>This makes them crazy. This pill will be holy to the north bank. For various reasons, there are too many powerful war animals, and it is difficult to leave offspring. Even those first-class blood vessels often have oestrus for hundreds of years. This is also one of the most headache problems in the north bank for many years.</p>
<p>Especially now, one of the two sacred animals of sunset peak, the blue eyed ghost moon monkey, is about to die, but there is no blood left, so it is imminent.</p>
<p>But at present, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s pill is so against the sky that the four palms on the north bank are sure to be obtained. They just searched for countless materials and failed to find the description of the pill. Finally, they had to make sure that it was a Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s own pill!</p>
<p>This has found the leader, found Li Qinghou, want to have.</p>
<p>If you change other disciples, even inner disciples, they only need one word. It&rsquo;s very simple. There are even too many ways to ask the disciples to hand in Dan Fang. But Bai Xiaochun is different He is a glorious disciple and a leader&rsquo;s younger brother. With such a status, they can only find a way to change it, but can&rsquo;t obtain it in other ways.</p>
<p>It even needs the consent of Bai Xiaochun. You can&rsquo;t force Originally, under the leader&rsquo;s mediation, he had reached some conditions with Li Qinghou, but before they had finished their discussion, they heard that the disciples of sunset peak were in trouble with Bai Xiaochun. All of a sudden, the four palm seats on the north bank were angry.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m afraid that the disciples of sunset peak don&rsquo;t know their propriety and offend Bai Xiaochun, making it more difficult to exchange for pills.</p>
<p>This has just sunset peak palm seat angry scene.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Younger martial brother chun, please come out and talk.&rdquo; All the disciples of Amitabha made great efforts, and all of them had a soft voice.</p>
<p>Inside the cave, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s eyes turned. He was surprised to see the scene outside. He felt that something was wrong. He saw Li Qinghou&rsquo;s eyes before. He was thinking. Although he did not know what had happened, he had countless guesses in his heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your disciples are so fierce. If you want to kill me, my life will be almost gone. I dare not go out&hellip;&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun thinks about things in her heart, and she opens her mouth wrongly and spreads out her words.</p>
<p>His words were pitiful. After his words came out, the two brothers felt a cool breath rising from behind, and the other disciples of sunset peak all changed their faces. They still saw the importance of Bai Xiaochun in the four palms on the north bank. It was almost flattering. At this time, Bai Xiaochun opened his mouth like this, and their fate can be imagined.</p>
<p>When Li Qinghou and Zheng Yuandong twitch slightly, the palm seat of sunset peak suddenly turns his head and looks at the disciples of sunset peak with a low roar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t admit your mistake to your uncle Bai!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Those disciples of sunset peak, one by one, cried and cried, and quickly admitted their mistakes to the cave.</p>
<p>Beihanlie is desperate for grief and indignation. He is about to struggle. He can see his master&rsquo;s stern eyes. He lowers his head wrongly and clasps his fist toward the cave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle Bai I I I&rsquo;m wrong</p>
<p>The north cold wind was silent. In his struggle, he looked up at his master. When he saw the master&rsquo;s eyes more and more fierce, he felt a tremor in his heart and blue veins on his forehead, but he could not help but admit his mistake with his fists.</p>
<p>The whole man trembled, and his eyes toward the cave were furious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Younger martial brother chun, do you think this is good?&rdquo; The setting sun peak palm seat hastens to speak, diligently lets oneself be more amiable.</p>
<p>After a long time, a crack appeared in the cave array. Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s head came out and took a quick look around. Then he coughed and swaggered out. He raised his chin and looked high.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forget it. As an elder, I won&rsquo;t care about them in general.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun is a generous little sleeve.</p>
<p>In front of him, beihanlie&rsquo;s eyes were bloodshot, and the whole person trembled. He wanted to go up and punch Bai Xiaochun in the face, but he didn&rsquo;t dare to do so. His elder brother, beihanfeng, felt that the world was spinning, and the feeling of holding back and bending made him crazy.</p>
<p>The two people&rsquo;s eyes, let Bai Xiaochun angry, he fiercely stare in the past, in the heart secretly said at this time, who is afraid of who, than the eyes, I have never been afraid of others in my life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Xiaochun, your one can make war beast hair The pill of love, but are you original? &quot; The palm seat of sunset peak took a deep breath and asked in a soft voice.</p>
<p>At his exit, the old woman and the other two palm seats on the north bank looked at Bai Xiaochun with expectation in their eyes. The two brothers only felt a buzzing sound in their minds and thoroughly understood the cause and effect. They were bitter and bitter, and they hated Bai Xiaochun even more.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun blinked, in the heart suddenly understood the reason, a firm chest, head proud of the nod.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. That great pill is just my own secret recipe. No one can refine it. Only I can make it myself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The four palms on the north bank were very happy, but they didn&rsquo;t show much. The middle-aged man at sunset peak laughed and nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Younger martial brother Xiaochun is so young that he can create an original prescription, which is worthy of Tianjiao. The prescription of this pill is very important to our Lingxi sect. I&rsquo;d like to give 100000 contribution points to exchange for your prescription, OK? Younger martial brother Xiaochun, you change this Dan Fang to zongmen, but it&rsquo;s a great event that benefits the whole clan. As a glorious disciple, the sect is your home. &quot; Sunset peak middle-aged man Chunchun good lure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun immediately opened her mouth. She had a look of going through fire and water for the family. She even talked about Dan Fang directly. The four palm seats on the north bank were pleasantly surprised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dan Fang is mingjuezi, Bodhisattva, Lingdong bamboo, and Why, what else is there? How can I not remember it? Did you forget it just after being frightened Bai Xiaochun frowned again and thought hard.</p>
<p>Li Qinghou smiles at the corners of his mouth. Zheng Yuandong is helpless. He has four palms on the north bank. How can he not see the reason? When he grins bitterly, he grits his teeth and looks at the disciples of sunset peak.</p>
<p>Swept by his eyes, all the disciples of sunset peak, including the North Han brothers, all trembled.</p>
