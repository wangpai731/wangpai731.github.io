      <p>A few days later, in the alchemy room where Bai Xiaochun is, a roar comes out, and Bai Xiaochun walks out with a sad face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first-class pills are almost skilled, but the second-class pills are so difficult&hellip;&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun raised his voice in sorrow. During these days, in addition to practicing medicine, he spent almost all the plants in his pocket. He planned to try to make second-order miraculous medicine, but now it is more difficult. Even if he is meticulous, he still fails.</p>
<p>Each time there will be a large number of problems, after tackling, more problems appear.</p>
<p>At the moment, he sighed and walked out of the refining medicine Pavilion. When he looked up, he immediately saw that there were many people sitting there with their knees crossed. These people were in groups of thirty or fifty, and there were more than ten of them. Most of them were young women.</p>
<p>They are fat and skinny, competing for novelty and beauty. A group of women in YingYing and Yanyan are all beautiful after seeing Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>All of them followed their elders, who were surprised to see Bai Xiaochun. A group of people cheered and rushed to Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop, you What are you doing? &quot; Bai Xiaochun is stunned, some can not feel the situation, subconsciously back a few steps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bai Daoyou, my husband Zhao Tianhai, Zhao Yiduo is my nephew. Ha ha, Bai Daoyou&rsquo;s young hero. He is really a good-looking talent!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Among the friends of Bai Dao, the dragon and Phoenix are extremely brave. At first glance, they are Kunpeng in the clouds, and the future generations will be unlimited. Cough, my husband sun Yunshan. These are the daughters of my sun family. Are you short of some servant girls around you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bai Daoyou, my husband, Sunday, when I saw Bai Daoyou, I felt heroic, as if I saw the future overlord of the eastern cultivation world. We were as old as before. How about these women around me? They are all the Pearl treasures of our Zhou family&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A lot of voices came out. Bai Xiaochun opened her eyes wide and stepped back again. After a long time, she understood that these people were coming to see off the women of her family</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t know the reason. Seeing that all these women were quite beautiful, especially many of them were in line with Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s aesthetic taste. At the moment, he gave them to himself in vain. If he didn&rsquo;t, he would not give them face. Let Bai Xiaochun be vigilant here.</p>
<p>However, he was smooth, and did not reveal his inner thoughts at the moment. With a smile on his face, he talked with the responsible people of Xiuzhen family and left quickly.</p>
<p>Before he got back to his residence, he met many people who were obviously in his way. Each of them had the same words. He sent out his daughter, his resources and countless benefits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the big deal!! Did they find out what kind of immortals are there in my ancestors? Can you say that I am not ordinary, I am I&rsquo;m Bai Xiaochun is also a man of great talent? My God, I don&rsquo;t know about it myself Bai Xiaochun gradually panicked, and ran all the way. When she returned to her residence, she was surrounded by a group of Xiuzhen family members waiting here. They all showed eager eyes. It seemed that as long as Bai Xiaochun nodded, everything would do!</p>
<p>Especially those women, every one of them is like this, all of them are surrounded by Bai Xiaochun, they are hostile to each other, you push me, I pile you up.</p>
<p>Seeing Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s scalp numb, she was surrounded in the middle. No matter how she touched her clothes, she felt that her clothes were being pulled. When she was in a panic, a cold hum came from the distance. She saw Hou Xiaomei, staring at her eyes, bulging her cheeks, and panting forward, tearing a woman apart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go away, go away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing? This is Lingxi zongxiangyun mountain. You aunts, do you know how to be reserved and go away, and you, you are thin as a lentil, what&rsquo;s the fun? And you, fat as a sow, get out of the way!&rdquo; Hou Xiaomei voice with anger, go forward to all the women around Bai Xiaochun are pushed away.</p>
<p>She was very angry and small, but she seemed to have infinite strength. In this friction, those women stopped working immediately and began to speak. Hou Xiaomei pinched her waist with her hands and looked like a little pepper. Her words were sharp and sour, attacking the key points everywhere.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun took the opportunity to flee back to the yard. When she bowed her head, she was shocked to see that her clothes were all loose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s terrible!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun took a breath and looked out of the door. Hou Xiaomei stood at the door, fighting against dozens of people.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, the people in charge of the Xiuzhen family couldn&rsquo;t stand it. They left one by one in persuasion. Before leaving, they still clasped hands with Bai Xiaochun and said that they would visit again another day.</p>
<p>It was not until dusk that the door was quiet. But from a distance, many people from the Xiuzhen family were sitting on their knees in the distance and guarding there.</p>
<p>All the Xiuzhen families who can come here have their own means. They can stay here and no one will drive them away.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun felt that something must have happened. Seeing that the outer door was quiet, she pulled Hou Xiaomei in.</p>
<p>Hou Xiaomei is a outsider, which is extremely pungent, but at the moment when Bai Xiaochun pulls her arm, her face turns red immediately. She just feels dizzy and cleverly follows Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s intention and is pulled to her side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little Brother chun, there are so many people here. What do you want&hellip; &quot; Hou Xiaomei whispered, soft and soft as a mosquito.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah?&rdquo; White small pure one Leng, see Hou Xiaomei such a look, suddenly surprised, patted Hou Xiaomei&rsquo;s face, see Hou Xiaomei is still abnormal, so took a picture again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hou Xiaomei wakes up and stomps her feet in shame. Knowing that she has just misunderstood her, she throws a jade slip to Bai Xiaochun and runs out with her head down.</p>
<p>Seeing Hou Xiaomei run away, Bai Xiaochun is a little confused. He looks at the jade slips left by Hou Xiaomei. After sweeping, he suddenly widens his eyes and looks carefully. After a long time, he stands in the yard and takes a breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glory family&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hou Yunfei asked Hou Xiaomei to send the jade slips. He didn&rsquo;t know how to talk about some words, so he lured the status of Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s glorious disciple to the Xiuzhen family. Confused, the cause and effect, completely explained, finally, vaguely mentioned that their Hou family, also have a great desire for Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s descendants, hope This descendant, can have half Hou&rsquo;s blood.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun thought of the appearance of Hou Xiaomei just now, so she touched her chin, and her eyes slowly showed light. Her attention was not in Hou Xiaomei&rsquo;s, but she thought that it was a great good thing for herself!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect that I thought that this time the credit and reward were useless. Only the identity of the leader and younger brother made me proud of all the heroes in the sect. I didn&rsquo;t expect that the status of the proud disciple who was not cared about was actually at the door of the sect, so supreme Bai Xiaochun licked her lips and her heart pounded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Taoist couple chooses at will and gives all the resources to you Hope for long life Bai Xiaochun laughed and his eyes were brighter. He was worried about the consumption of refining the second-order elixir. He was unable to support himself. Now there are so many people rushing up to ask for people to give people and things to give.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity, if only I could take all of them&hellip;&rdquo; When Bai Xiaochun murmured, his mind suddenly flashed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, why not all of them?&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun came back to the house with a dry cough. He did not rest this night and was thinking about it. In the morning of the next day, he got up in high spirits. When he opened the gate of the yard, there were already people from the Xiuzhen family waiting outside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bai Daoyou&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m here to visit you in the name of my family&rsquo;s ancestors&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>People speak, voice countless, white Xiaochun raised chin, small sleeve a swing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s talk about something when we come in.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun opened his mouth with a smile and randomly ordered a family. Immediately, the person in charge of Xiuzhen family was pleasantly surprised, and she came in quickly with her family girl.</p>
<p>After a while, he left with those women. He looked worried about his gains and losses when he left. When he looked around, the other Xiuzhen families were very worried, so they immediately sent letters to the family.</p>
<p>In this way, another family went in. Slowly, one by one, until the whole day passed. Bai Xiaochun saw dozens of Xiuzhen families at one go.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t ask for or refuse any of them. He said he wanted to think about it. It was too big for him to think about it. He also refused the so-called meeting gifts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m white Xiaochun. I sit upright. Since I haven&rsquo;t decided whether to marry your family or not, it&rsquo;s hard to accept this gift.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun said this to every family he visited.</p>
<p>The more he said that, the more stupid it was that no Xiuzhen family would be so stupid as to take away the gift of meeting. So they were all polite until they said that even if they could not become relatives, they would be friends. Bai Xiaochun reluctantly accepted them.</p>
<p>These Xiuzhen families are not stupid people. They also see that Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s thinking is actually to wait for all the families to see before choosing the most suitable one.</p>
<p>However, the matter was expected. They were not afraid of giving gifts. What they were afraid of was that Bai Xiaochun didn&rsquo;t have the heart to choose a Taoist couple. So the next day, not only were there fewer people coming, but more and more people came. Even many Xiuzhen families proposed that their own family daughters should not necessarily be Taoist partners, even if they were one of the maids warming the bed. As long as there is blood, let Bai Xiaochun admit it here.</p>
<p>And these Xiuzhen families who came to visit Bai Xiaochun, one by one, sent out the meeting gifts, which made Bai Xiaochun frightened. In the end, even if he wanted to refuse, the other party thought that he looked down on his family.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll take It&rsquo;s not good to collect.</p>
<p>”Bai Xiaochun has been collecting for seven or eight days. She is used to seeing a group of people waiting for the door every morning.</p>
<p>Three days later, when Bai Xiaochun opened the door in the morning, he was stunned and no one was left outside Clean, looking up from afar, still so.</p>
<p>Only in the distance, there are a few colorful birds flying gracefully over there. These birds are the favorite pets of Zhou Chang. They are always surrounded by Xiangyun mountain on weekdays. Especially in the early morning, they will fly in groups. They are very beautiful. Many students admire them when they see them.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun rubbed her eyes and felt that it was the wrong way to open the door, so she opened it again. Still, he woke up with a start.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun was surprised and hurried out to find out Hou Yunfei and got the answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The leader passed down the edict last night. As your senior brother, he informed all Xiuzhen families According to the rules of the school, you can&rsquo;t choose a Taoist partner for a hundred years, so We have no choice but to leave. &quot; Hou Yunfei sighs and looks at Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>White small pure Leng, in the heart is very aggrieved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is to cut off my fortune and ruin my marriage&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hou Yunfei couldn&rsquo;t laugh or cry. Then he seemed to think of something. Suddenly he looked dignified and began to speak slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Xiaochun, I heard from my friends in Qingfeng mountain that you had some conflicts with Shangguan Tianyou? It doesn&rsquo;t matter if Qian Dajin is a person. The clan has also tacitly dealt with it, but Shangguan Tianyou is not easy! &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s not easy? Is he older than us? &quot; Bai Xiaochun has been in Lingxi for many years now. He has long understood that the cultivation method of disciples is the general direction. It is forbidden to kill each other, encourage mutual help, and encourage mutual competition. There are sect rules as the general program management. The leaders of each peak assist in the management. The law enforcement hall is a deterrent and the headmaster is in charge of the overall situation.</p>
<p>In a small place, the Lingxi clan, with hundreds of thousands of people, naturally can&rsquo;t be subtle. There are even a lot of crooked thoughts among the disciples, which can&rsquo;t be controlled at all. However, the rewards and punishments are clear. Who should go out of line and be severely punished!</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun has made great contributions to the clan, as well as his attainments in vegetation and combat power. These clans naturally know and attach great importance to them. However, they do not follow him every day and take care of him like a servant. Some even ridicule him or challenge him, they immediately jump out to stop him No one of the disciples was treated like this, no matter whether Shangguan Tianyou or Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>Therefore, Bai Xiaochun felt that the Shangguan Tianyou, who had never been seen before, was extremely arrogant and had a great reputation of Tianjiao. Even now, as an outside disciple, some inner disciples were willing to call him Shaozhu, but he still ignored it.</p>
<p>Hou Yunfei pondered for a moment and continued to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shangguan Tianyou has a great ambition and the goal is to enter the legendary inheritance sequence one day. Therefore, he always suppresses cultivation and does not break through. He has to enter the inner door as the first one when he tries the North-South comparison with Tianjiao on the eighth floor of condensate gas. Otherwise, he could have applied for promotion on the eighth floor of condensate gas After all, when we reach the eighth condensate layer, most of them can successfully complete the test and become the inner disciples. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can we all become a succession sequence? I heard Xu Baocai say that Zhou Xinqi and LV Tianlei also have such pursuits. &quot; Bai Xiaochun was stunned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The inheritance sequence is equal to your glorious disciples, but it is another system of our Lingxi sect. Different from other sects, Lingxi sect has two systems: one is to manage the sect and the other is to constantly accumulate efforts to improve the status of the sect!</p>
<p>Below the third floor of condensate is the worker, and below the eighth floor is the outer gate. When you get to the eighth floor of condensate, you can apply for the inner door test. If you succeed, you will be promoted to the inner disciple.</p>
<p>If we can build a foundation If they can break through the golden elixir after two years, they will be the supreme elder of the sect, guarding and managing the sect. These are the first system.</p>
<p>There is also a second system, which is the succession sequence!</p>
<p>There is only one way to enter the succession sequence From then on, it became the accumulation of zongmen in order to break through their status in the Xiuzhen realm and obtain more huge resources Real details! If you can be the first family of Tianjiao battle, it will be more helpful for entering the inheritance sequence in the future. I don&rsquo;t know the specific situation, but there is this gate rule!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that it&rsquo;s too hard to become a golden elixir In the last generation, the most promising one was Li Qing waiting for the throne of Li Zhang. Therefore, he was highly valued by the clan! &quot; Hou Yunfei&rsquo;s eyes showed expectation, and told Bai Xiaochun what he knew as a member of Xiuzhen family.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun took a breath. This was the first time he heard about the succession sequence. This also gave him a clear understanding of the clan. When he left after a while, he was still thinking about the issue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Succession sequence?&rdquo;</p>
