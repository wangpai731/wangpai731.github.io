      <p>Dark night, no moon and stars, no light in the night sky.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan has been kneeling at the entrance of the cave for nearly six hours. Most of the disciples of other sects have gone to sleep. Even the last light in the dazhufeng cave, which was lit at the end of the day, has gradually died out.</p>
<p>In the cave, Tian didn&rsquo;t seem to say a word. Tian linger almost immediately called out, &ldquo;Dad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>No voice, no following, Zhang Xiaofan did not know what happened, but soon, song Daren came out.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan looks up at the elder martial brother. Song Daren could not bear it, but he said: &ldquo;little brother, Shifu said you kneel here to upset him. If you want to kneel, you should kneel far away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s heart sank, but his face suddenly felt cold. It rained in the dark night.</p>
<p>Without saying a word, he got up in silence, went to the distance, knelt down on the edge of the dense forest, under the ancient wood.</p>
<p>Song Daren looked at him for a long time, but saw his younger martial brother&rsquo;s figure in the dark rain and fog, gradually blurred, sighed softly, shook his head, and walked back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roar&rdquo; a loud sound, thunder came from the sky, White Lightning claws across the sky, as if the dark night sky split into several pieces. A moment later, the big rain drops like small stones smashed down, hit on the rocks, crackling. Later, it rained cats and dogs.</p>
<p>In a twinkling of an eye, Zhang Xiaofan was completely wet for a moment, and his clothes were tightly attached to him, which was cold. He raised his head and looked ahead. The dark night, coupled with the heavy rain, could not see the cave clearly.</p>
<p>Between heaven and earth, it seems that he is the only one left, suffering here.</p>
<p>He lowered his head and did not move.</p>
<p>The heavy rain. But it seems that he was also punished by heaven, but it was the next one that kept on raining and thundering. Roar on him!</p>
<p>The rain flowed down from his wet hair and slid down his face. Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s eyes could hardly open, but at this time, when there was no one left. But he suddenly saw, in front of him, there was a figure, a foot, stepping in front of him.</p>
<p>He raised his head laboriously, the lightning flashed in the sky, and the thunder roared. By the dim light, he saw the beautiful woman standing in front of him.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was totally stunned.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi is wet all over. The lightning flashed away, and her figure became a hazy shadow in the dark. But Zhang Xiaofan clearly felt that she was in front of her.</p>
<p>On a stormy and windy night, the gentle figure squatted down in front of him.</p>
<p>The more rain, the more wind!</p>
<p>Deep in the woods, it seems that there are demons howling and shouting.</p>
<p>A cold palm, with a slight tremor, stroked Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s hair tip. Like a dream voice, in this stormy night, low tunnel: &ldquo;don&rsquo;t be afraid, will soon pass!&rdquo;</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be here with you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boom!&rdquo; The thunder seemed to shatter the night sky. It broke my heart. Crazy lightning place, wind and rain howling, cold rain like demons dancing, that a gentle face, that pair of gentle eyes, like the sweetest figure in a dream. Be by your side.</p>
<p>In the wind and rain, she whispered to Zhang Xiaofan, as if to her deep heart, and said softly: &ldquo;you save me and protect me, at your own cost, I will treat you generally.</p>
<p>You know the pain in your heart. Heaven knows it. I can&rsquo;t share your pain, so I will share it with you. I always hope that one day, you will be able to be happy with your lover&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>The sound of the words faded away. The wind and rain are more crazy, and the figure is so weak. If the grass is injured in the wind, it will swing indefinitely. Zhang Xiaofan was in a trance and dreamlike state.</p>
<p>The night is dark and the sky is speechless!</p>
<p>The wind and rain raged for a long time, just a little convergence, Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s whole body was cold, the cold air hit his body, his hands and feet were already cold. He knew that if he went on like this, he would be seriously ill, but he would not get up to hide from the rain anyway.</p>
<p>In this cold, however, from the arm of his right hand, if there is a faint warmth, it slowly swam in his body, reaching a lot of cold air, as if it came from the magic weapon xuanhuojian tied to his right hand.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan suddenly thought of the ghost like woman just now. In a trance, he thought it was Lu Xueqi. But at this moment, he could not see where the shadow of the human was anymore. He did not know whether he had left or never appeared.</p>
<p>Thinking of this, he smiled bitterly, shook his head and splashed with water. But at this time, clearly heard a voice: &ldquo;silly boy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was stunned. He turned around quickly and almost called out &ldquo;elder martial sister Lu&rdquo;.</p>
<p>But I saw a woman walking out of the forest slowly, holding an umbrella to cover the wind and rain, smiling at him, but he never thought that he would see the person here - the devil cult girl Biyao.</p>
<p>At this time, in the middle of the night, although the rain is smaller than before, it is still quite big, and it can&rsquo;t be seen from a little distance. Zhang Xiaofan thought he was dazzled, but when he looked at it, it was really Biyao. He came here with a smile on his face.</p>
<p>I saw that she was still dressed in water green clothes, and was still holding the green oilcloth umbrella in her hand. But the wind and rain were so heavy that she got wet several times on the edge of her light clothes. When I came to the front, I could see the truth more and more. Those places were wet by water, soft and soft on the skin.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan suddenly bowed his head and didn&rsquo;t go to see her.</p>
<p>Biyao was stunned for a moment, squatted down in front of him, looked at him up and down, chuckled, and said, &ldquo;you are really weird. In such a heavy rain, you must kneel here. Isn&rsquo;t this also your practice method in Qingyun gate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan didn&rsquo;t give her a good look, but saw the pretty face of Biyao in the night. The unexpected tenderness was like water, so he couldn&rsquo;t help but stay for a while.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boom!&rdquo; Thunder rumbled from the dark clouds in the sky. Almost a moment ago, a huge lightning stroke across the sky, split the night sky into two parts, flashed a flash, and then disappeared. With the thunder and lightning, the rain all over the sky, it is big again.</p>
<p>Biyao frowned and leaned forward. Zhang Xiaofan suddenly found that the original hit in the body of the rain. Suddenly there was less. It was as if the whole person had been suddenly liberated under heavy pressure. He was relaxed.</p>
<p>He looked up, but it was Baguio who had moved her umbrella half way. He stopped the rain for him. However, how heavy the rain is. When Biyao got Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s attention, she inevitably missed something, and half of her body was wet in a twinkling of an eye.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan felt warm and could not help but stretch out his hand and push the umbrella over. In a low voice, &ldquo;you just had a serious illness in the blood dripping hole. Be careful of catching cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biyao seems to be stunned and looks at Zhang Xiaofan.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan is looked by her strangely, surprised way: &ldquo;how?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Baguio smiled, but she seemed to be very happy. She said, &ldquo;you know how to care about my body, you little boy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s face turned red, but fortunately in this stormy night, it was hard to see it. At the moment, he said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you will be ill later. It&rsquo;s on my head again. &quot;</p>
<p>When Biyao leaned close to him, he and he squatted side by side. The difference is that Zhang Xiaofan knelt on the ground, while Biyao squatted beside him. At the same time, Baguio&rsquo;s umbrella moved over again, blocking them from the wind and rain.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan only felt that in the wind and rain, but there was a light gentle, faint fragrance around him. It came from the dark, and he couldn&rsquo;t help looking aside. I don&rsquo;t want to see Biyao, but they are also looking at him. They look at each other, and then they are stunned. After a while, Zhang Xiaofan first looked away. I don&rsquo;t know why, but his heart began to beat violently.</p>
<p>And Biyao, who has always been able to speak very well, is now quiet down, squatting quietly beside Zhang Xiaofan and accompanying him. Just when he didn&rsquo;t pay attention, he quietly moved the umbrella to Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s body, which blocked a little more wind and rain for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; Zhang Xiaofan, who was in the middle of silence and confused, suddenly thought of something. He couldn&rsquo;t help crying out and looked back at Biyao. He looked worried and said, &ldquo;how can you come here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Baguio is not too surprised at his response, just a light smile, the voice is quiet, in the wind and rain all over the sky, with some sad fans: &ldquo;I come to see you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan lowered his voice, but the anxieties in his voice were too much. He said: &ldquo;we are all around here. Don&rsquo;t say that there are those predecessors of Tianyin temple and burning incense valley. They are the elders who come out of our Qingyun gate, and you will die. Are you still going? &quot;</p>
<p>But Biyao seemed to be indifferent. She just smiled at Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s worried look, sighed suddenly, and said, &ldquo;you stinky boy, you have some conscience!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was speechless for a moment.</p>
<p>I only heard the voice of Biyao: &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you live in the right way? Don&rsquo;t you have two sides? Why don&rsquo;t you call for me? &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was worried and listened to her words, but his heart was shocked and his whole body was sweating. Although he is not as talented and intelligent as Lin Jingyu and her elder martial sister Tian linger in the eyes of outsiders, he is not a fool after all. However, no one has paid attention to him all these years on Dazhu peak, which makes him feel inferior.</p>
<p>At the moment, after listening to the angry and happy words of Biyao, Zhang Xiaofan immediately responded that his situation at the moment was greatly inappropriate.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t say that I am still the body of Dai sin punished by my master. I am found by my classmates at the moment. I am so intimate with this evil cult girl. I&rsquo;m afraid that I can&rsquo;t tell if I&rsquo;m full of mouth.</p>
<p>At the thought of this consequence, Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s voice of &ldquo;buzzing&rdquo; in his head did not dare to think about it any more. In a confusion, she was about to open her mouth and shout at the same door. Unexpectedly, she glanced at her eyes and saw that Biyao was leaning on her shoulder. At the moment, it was windy and rainy, but she covered most of her umbrellas on her head. Her half body was wet.</p>
<p>The clothes, tightly attached to her skin, reflected in his eyes. Even on her snow-white face, there were a few drops of rain, condensed into beads, and slowly slid down.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan couldn&rsquo;t give out this cry in any way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you suffer?&rdquo; Zhang Xiaofan lowered his head and whispered, &ldquo;I also guess your father must be a big man. I think you are also a big lady who is well-off. Why do you come here to suffer for a small Qingyun disciple who takes such a big risk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wind and rain Xiao Xiao, heaven and earth Su Sha, boundless night rain, as if the whole world, there is only this place, only two of them.</p>
<p>Baguio seems to feel a little cold. He also leaned closer to Zhang Xiaofan, which was both kind and familiar, just like the scene of the two of them at the critical moment of life and death in the blood dripping hole that day.</p>
<p>Her voice. At the moment, he also took a bit of drift: &ldquo;no, I didn&rsquo;t suffer. You don&rsquo;t know that the real pain in the world is in people&rsquo;s hearts&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>Her voice gradually sank, and the words behind her became inaudible. Zhang Xiaofan suddenly realized that she was leaning her head on her shoulder.</p>
<p>Wind, rain, whistling and passing, Zhang Xiaofan only feel that his mind is blank.</p>
<p>There is only a faint fragrance beside him. In the cold wind and rain, it&rsquo;s really twining around him.</p>
<p>In the morning, the clouds open and the sun rises, and the rain stops and the wind stops.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not easy for Tian to walk out of the cave alone. He only sees his little apprentice in the distance. Unexpectedly, I still kneel at the edge of the forest in the distance, motionless.</p>
<p>He frowned and went over. When he came near, Zhang Xiaofan heard the voice and raised his head. He saw that it was Shifu Tian that was not easy. He moved his mouth twice and called out in a low voice, &ldquo;Shifu.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard for Tian to see that his clothes are all wet, there are water drops on his hair from time to time, and his face looks even paler.</p>
<p>Obviously it rained heavily last night and he suffered a lot.</p>
<p>Thinking of this, he could not help frowning, and now he heard the row of caves behind him. There is a faint voice. It is expected that the disciples of all sects have risen. Farmland not easy to hum a, carry a step to walk toward the woods, pass by Zhang Xiaofan when, light way: &ldquo;you follow me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan answered in a hurry, then he would get up. Unexpectedly, the body just stood up. Suddenly, the foot was soft and fell down again. I felt numbness and pain in my feet. I thought it was caused by kneeling for one night.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not easy for Tian to walk ahead. When he stops, he seems to have hesitated for a while, but he still hasn&rsquo;t turned back, and he still goes straight ahead.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan is biting his teeth and massaging his legs with his hands. Fortunately, he is not a spoiled person. The body he trained when cutting bamboo at Dazhu peak now has a response. After a while, his Qi and blood are a little smooth and he can walk.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan stood up, looked forward, but saw that Tian&rsquo;s hard figure was almost disappearing in the forest, and hurriedly ran up with him. Soon, when the orthodox disciples in the cave came out, they couldn&rsquo;t be seen.</p>
<p>In the forest on Liubo mountain, there are towering ancient trees everywhere. The trees surrounded by one person are everywhere, which are the huge trees that two or three people can hold. Unexpectedly, they can also be seen from time to time. I think it&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s in a remote place and there&rsquo;s no one here.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan follows Tian&rsquo;s hard-working back, walking slowly in the forest. The light of the early morning came down from the top of the trees and sprinkled on the bushes in the forest.</p>
<p>In the forest after the rain, it seems that everything has been cleaned, and everywhere is green. Occasionally, there are unknown flowers, blooming in the lonely place, sending out a light fragrance.</p>
<p>It is not easy for Tian to walk in front of him. He is silent and silent all the time. He was short and fat. At this time, Zhang Xiaofan was half taller than him. But in Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s eyes, the figure of that man was as tall as a mountain god. What&rsquo;s more, at the moment in his heart, Baguio&rsquo;s affairs are pressing him like a hill, which makes him upset. What can I do?</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was upset. He was thinking about whether to tell his master about Biyao. Tian could not help but stop and turn around. Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s heart jumped and stopped.</p>
<p>I can only see that this place is the deep part of the forest. There is no one around. There are many ancient trees. There is no sound except the faint birdsong in the distance.</p>
<p>Tian was not easy to look at him up and down, and said with no expression: &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve been in the rain all night, are you ok?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan shook his head and said in a low voice, &ldquo;I deserve what I deserve. It doesn&rsquo;t matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian is not easy to hum a, way: &ldquo;your mouth says relaxed, in the heart but hate me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was startled, and his pale face turned white again. &ldquo;Master, I and I never have that idea. I deserve it. I will never blame master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian is not easy to look at the little disciple in front of him, who has been ignored by him for years. He looks worried and says something. His mouth moves and sighs, and his face looks gentle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right! Now there is no one around. Do you have anything to say to me? &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was worried. He wondered if Shifu had known about Bagao. Today, the relationship between Zhang Xiaofan and Biyao is rather delicate. Last night, Biyao came here, and he was afraid to be known by the elders of each school. Isn&rsquo;t it</p>
<p>He was just thinking about it. Tian was not easy but a little impatient. Seeing him, he kept silent all the time and said, &ldquo;I asked you why did you suddenly do that to your elder martial brother yesterday?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was stunned for a moment, and realized that Shifu didn&rsquo;t mean Biyao, so he was relieved.</p>
<p>But then he opened his mouth and couldn&rsquo;t speak. He couldn&rsquo;t say that he lost his mind because he saw Tian ling&rsquo;er with Qi Hao, right? What&rsquo;s more, he can&rsquo;t even tell himself, what is that strange evil spirit that controls his mood in a moment?</p>
<p>Tian is not easy to wait for a long time. Seeing Zhang Xiaofan still speechless, he sneers and says, &ldquo;but you are dissatisfied because you see ling&rsquo;er&rsquo;s intimacy with Qi Hao?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was shocked and lost his color. He only felt a loud buzzing in his mind, and the whole person stayed in place.</p>
<p>His private love for Tian ling&rsquo;er is one of his deepest secrets. He never told anyone. Unexpectedly, he was suddenly told coldly by his most revered master. It really shakes his soul more than last night&rsquo;s shocking thunder.</p>
<p>For a moment, he could hardly move. He had no strength to deny, but it was not easy to look at Tian. He opened his mouth wide and could not say a word. (to be continued. )</p>
