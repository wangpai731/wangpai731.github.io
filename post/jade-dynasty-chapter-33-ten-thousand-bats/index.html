      <p>Zhang Xiaofan was stunned for a moment, and recognized that this was the beautiful girl who was arguing about the sleeping fish at dinner. At the moment, he saw that she was still dressed in a suit of water green clothes, and her skin was like snow, beautiful and fairy like under the moonlight.</p>
<p>The young girl put the newly folded flowers on her nose and inhaled deeply. Her face was intoxicated and even more breathtaking. And the flower seemed to be more brilliant in front of her beautiful face.</p>
<p>But Zhang Xiaofan, from the bottom of his heart, burst out a nameless anger, frowned and said, &ldquo;this flower is blooming well, why do you want to fold it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The green girl&rsquo;s bright eyes turned. The waves of her eyes turned on Zhang Xiaofan like water. She said lightly: &ldquo;I picked the flower, which is the blessing of the flower. I smell the fragrance of the flower, which is the fate of the third life of the flower. How can you know such a layman? &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was stupefied for a moment. For the first time in his life, he heard of such absurd things. He shook his head and said, &ldquo;if you fold this flower, you will lose your life. How can you be happy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl in green glanced at him and said, &ldquo;you are not a flower. How do you know it will not be happy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan listened to the woman&rsquo;s words, which was unreasonable, and his heart was even angry. He said: &ldquo;you are not a flower, and how can you know that it will be happy? Maybe the flower is suffering at the moment. Ah, you see, there is water on the flower, and it&rsquo;s not sure that it&rsquo;s painful to cry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl in green obviously stayed for a while, and after a moment, she burst out laughing. This time, she was as beautiful as a hundred flowers blooming, which almost dazzled Zhang Xiaofan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tears of flowers? Ha ha, Hua Lei, it&rsquo;s the first time in my life that I heard a big man say that the dew is the tears of flowers, which killed me with a smile. &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s face was red, and he couldn&rsquo;t speak, but the girl&rsquo;s waist was bent with a smile, and her face was feverish, and she said to herself, &ldquo;so, what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t want that girl to listen to this to see him, but the laughter is bigger, the clear laughter echoes in this quiet dark garden. It&rsquo;s a little warm.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan is angry, but he doesn&rsquo;t know how to open his mouth when he wants to say something. Looking at the woman&rsquo;s happy smile, he stamped his foot angrily. Turn around and go.</p>
<p>Did not walk two steps, suddenly heard behind that green dress young girl to receive the laughter, but the tone or with a little smile, said: &ldquo;Hello, you wait a moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan would have come out tonight.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in a good mood, but when I met this woman, I was in a bad mood. At the moment, I heard her cry out, and I was upset again. I couldn&rsquo;t help turning back and saying, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t call Hello, who are you calling?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young girl was stunned for a while, and her smile suddenly closed. It seemed that her eyes were cold to see Zhang Xiaofan. It seemed that few people had contradicted her so much. But a moment later. She seemed to think of something. Although she didn&rsquo;t recover her brilliant smile, her voice was still mild, and she said, &ldquo;Oh, what&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan rushed to his mouth and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m calling.&rdquo; he snorted and said, &ldquo;why should I tell you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl in green looked angry, but she saw Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s angry expression. Just like a little boy, he could not help laughing again.</p>
<p>This smile completely scattered the momentum of her face just now. It was full of fragrance against the moon in the sky. The beautiful woman&rsquo;s face was full of smiles, as if she knew it wasn&rsquo;t very good. She shook her head and was about to hold back, but she still smiled.</p>
<p>As if the innocence of a long time ago had come back to life tonight.</p>
<p>Moonlight is like water. Gently sprinkled on her shoulder and face, reflecting the moving beauty.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan did not know when to watch it.</p>
<p>The young girl smiled for a while, and found that Zhang Xiaofan was staring at her. He said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m pretty?&rdquo; instead of blushing at her daughter&rsquo;s house</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was startled by her. She felt embarrassed as if she was caught as a thief. But under the girl&rsquo;s soft eyes, there was no escape: &ldquo;I, you, look good!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as the words came out, Zhang Xiaofan first stayed for a while, and a strange taste was floating in her heart. However, the girl didn&rsquo;t seem to care about it. She had a light smile on her face and said, &ldquo;I think so, from small to large, who doesn&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m beautiful? You guys are all the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Listening to her voice, she seems to have experienced vicissitudes at a young age. Zhang Xiaofan was about to contradict her, but when she looked at her, she saw her bright eyes and bright teeth. She was independent in the moonlight, and she was familiar with her. He remembered the beautiful figure of his elder martial sister on Qingyun Mountain and beside the clear water pool. At that moment, he suddenly lost his spirits and couldn&rsquo;t lift his spirits any more. He looked at the girl in green again, sighed low, said nothing, and turned away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; he walked a few steps, but he heard a cry from behind. Zhang Xiaofan turned around frowning and looked at the girl in green.</p>
<p>Her eyes narrowed slightly, and her lips seemed to be tightened, as if thinking something, but the atmosphere was suddenly silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo; She still asked, his shadow reflected in her eyes.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan suddenly retreated. The anger just now dissipated in a moment, as if facing this figure, a little anger should not be. He avoided the soft eyes and said, &ldquo;Zhang Xiaofan&rdquo; with a little timidity that he was also uneasy about</p>
<p>Then I walked back quickly, but I was a bit of a runaway.</p>
<p>He walked with head bowed and strided, just came to a corner of the zigzag path, and suddenly found a black figure in front of him. In this dark garden, it&rsquo;s really hard to find it if it&rsquo;s not near.</p>
<p>He could hardly hold back. Fortunately, his body was very responsive and he stopped in front of the man. In the dark, a pair of bright but quiet eyes appeared in front of him.</p>
<p>The two were so close that Zhang Xiaofan took a fright and hurriedly stepped back to see that he was the masked woman sitting beside the girl in green at dinner. She was still veiled at the moment, but she had changed into a black silk dress, which was almost like a ghost this night.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan settled down and breathed. He smelt a faint fragrance in his nose. I don&rsquo;t know whether it was the fragrance in this garden or when he was near the woman just now.</p>
<p>He felt that it was wrong to come out tonight. He said vaguely, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; And he passed by the masked woman and went to his place.</p>
<p>From beginning to end, the masked woman said nothing. Just standing there quietly, looking at the young man. When Zhang Xiaofan passed by, she turned around slowly and looked at the figure he left.</p>
<p>For a long time. When her figure almost merged with the darkness in the dark garden, she turned around and walked towards the deep garden. Soon, she saw the woman in green, still standing there. Playing with a folded flower in his hand.</p>
<p>The girl in green looks up, not surprised. She smiles and says, &ldquo;aunt you, you are back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The masked woman took a look at the flowers in her hand. The veil moved slightly. It seemed that she nodded and said, &ldquo;those four people are under the Qingyun gate.&rdquo; Her voice echoed in the garden, deep and soft, but with a ghostly air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The leader is Qi Hao of longshoufeng. The other three have never seen each other. It seems that they are young and don&rsquo;t know their names.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl in green smiled and said, &ldquo;I know a man who just passed by. His name is Zhang Xiaofan, the name of HaoTu.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The masked woman took a look at her and said lightly, &ldquo;Baguio, I haven&rsquo;t seen you appreciate flowers for a long time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Girl in green. That is to say, the girl who is called Biyao seems to be stunned for a while. Next moment, her beautiful face shows a new smile. &ldquo;Yes, aunt you, it&rsquo;s been a long time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She picked up the flower and looked at it carefully again. Then, in the eyes of the masked woman, the girl in green smiled. But the hands firmly clenched, the beautiful flowers kneaded into pieces.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>The next day, four people in Qingyun gate got up. After washing, Qi Hao gathered four people and discussed: &ldquo;kongsang mountain is three thousand miles away in the East. It&rsquo;s not close. We still have to hurry.&rdquo; The other three had no objection, so they checked out and set out.</p>
<p>The owner of shanhaiyuan really has admiration for Qingyun gate. The originally expensive house money has a 50% discount, almost the same as ordinary house money. Zhang Xiaofan looks at Qi Hao and the boss, joking and settling accounts, but he takes a look around. But when he leaves, he doesn&rsquo;t see the girl in green last night.</p>
<p>The four of them were flying in the sky. It took ten days for Zhang Xiaofan to travel the three thousand miles. In the meantime, Zhang Xiaofan naturally dragged his back a lot. However, in the next few days, Zhang Xiaofan became more familiar with the &ldquo;fire stick&rdquo;, and even flew like a man. When he was flying in the sky, he was really excited for several days 。</p>
<p>On this day, they finally arrived at kongsang mountain. All of them were shocked when they fell into the clouds. Within a hundred miles, a big mountain was steep and towering, but there were more rocks and less vegetation. Even less people were seen under the mountain, which was desolate.</p>
<p>At this time, it was almost dusk, and the sun was sinking in the West. The Yellow setting sun was shining on the empty mulberry mountain, as if it had brought some bleakness and some horror. They all set down at the foot of the mountain and put away the magic weapon of the immortal sword. Qi Hao looked at the sky and said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think there are any families to stay here. Let&rsquo;s go up the mountain immediately, look for the ancient cave of ten thousand bats and see if there is a suitable place to rest for one night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu nodded, &ldquo;elder martial brother Qi has a point. Let&rsquo;s go up the mountain.&rdquo; Zhang Xiaofan sees Zeng Shushu and agrees, but he has no problem. Lu Xueqi looks at the sky and says nothing, but he is the first to walk to the top of the mountain.</p>
<p>Although the kongsang mountain is not as high as the sky peak of Qingyun Mountain, it is not low. In addition, it is remote and precipitous, and there is no way to find. Four people go up from the foot of the mountain, only to the mountainside, and the sky is completely dark.</p>
<p>When the four of them came to the platform, Qi Hao stopped the crowd and took out a small copper mirror from his arms. All three of them recognized it as the &ldquo;six mirrors&rdquo; of Qingyun gate. They were stunned for a moment and didn&rsquo;t know what Qi Hao was going to do.</p>
<p>Qi Hao held the six directions mirror in his hand and recited a few incantations in a low voice. The originally dim six directions mirror seemed to have an induction and gradually lit up. Then it floated from Qi Hao&rsquo;s hand and stayed two feet above his head. The light gradually became bright. With a light yellow halo, it lit up a round ground about six feet around the four of them and protected them in the center.</p>
<p>Qi Hao said: &ldquo;kongsang mountain was the place where demons and Demons gathered eight hundred years ago, and I think it&rsquo;s desolate and strange. I&rsquo;m afraid there are many demons and demons. The six mirror function protects the owner, so we can also guard against it. &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan took a look at the six directions mirror floating in the air, only to see that the small mirror looks not amazing, but there is auspiciousness hidden in the clumsiness, which should not be underestimated. At this time, the crowd suddenly heard a loud noise in the distance, followed by the sound of &ldquo;crackling and crackling&rdquo;. The sound became more and more dense. At the end of the day, not only was the sound louder and louder, but also the rhythm could hardly be heard clearly. Only the huge noise of &ldquo;rumbling&rdquo; echoed in the wilderness. In the distance, with a little light from the six mirror in the dark, people could see a black cloud rising behind the mountain. It&rsquo;s even more strange in the dark, and the roar comes from there.</p>
<p>All of them were discolored. Zeng Shuzhu&rsquo;s eyes turned and suddenly lost his voice. &ldquo;Six mirrors!&rdquo; he said</p>
<p>As soon as he spoke, the crowd didn&rsquo;t react. The black cloud, which is more and more huge in the air, has already felt something. It moves here. A moment later, it seems that there is a shrill roar from the black cloud. In a moment, the black cloud turns together. Towards the four people, the only light in the night comes.</p>
<p>In an instant, the night sky was dark, as if it was covered by something. People only think that a smell of fishy smell suddenly fills all around, Zhang Xiaofan and others are all shocked. Only Qi Hao is calm. But his face was also white, and he said quickly, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t move around. Don&rsquo;t leave the six mirror aperture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another moment later, the roar and roar were close to the ear, reflecting the light of six mirror, and the people finally saw the black cloud, which was unexpectedly numerous black bats, dense, and looked at the body shape, which was more than twice the size of the bats seen in the past. Each one has a big mouth, in a black, scarlet mouth, ferocious terror.</p>
<p>But the light yellow light of Liuhe mirror. But at this time, it showed its effect. All bats were isolated from that aperture. However they collided and squeezed, the aperture remained motionless. On the contrary, the bat, which is close to the aperture and in contact with the light yellow light, makes a sound of &ldquo;Zizi&rdquo; from its black body. After a while, he fell to the ground and struggled. He could not live.</p>
<p>But there are too many bats in this group. Looking around, even the stars in the sky are covered. I&rsquo;m afraid there are not millions of them. Those who died on the ground were less than one million of them, but countless bats rushed forward. Four people were surrounded in the center. Although there was nothing to do for the time being, there were terrible bloody mouths around. The smell of stench was almost disgusting.</p>
<p>But after all, Liuhe mirror is the most precious treasure of Taoism. Under the attack of countless ferocious animals, there is no sign of fragile shaking. The Yellow diaphragm seems to be light and thin, but it stands like a mountain. In a short time, the bat bodies around the diaphragm pile up higher and higher.</p>
<p>At this moment, I don&rsquo;t know how many black bats are surrounded in the sky around this aperture, where there are three layers out of three, even three layers out of three. However, the impact of these animals on the aperture seems to slow down, and they seem to know that they are useless, so they don&rsquo;t do such useless things anymore. However, these bats seem to be reluctant to give up their delicious food, and they still surround and refuse to leave.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s mind was turbulent. He had never seen such a ferocious thing in his life. Until now, he was still a little nervous and scared. He gasped and took back his eyes from the bats around him, but he saw Lu Xueqi standing beside him with a pale face.</p>
<p>As if at the same time, Lu Xueqi also felt his eyes and looked at Zhang Xiaofan here. Their eyes met in the air.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi suddenly turned her head. Her pale face seemed white again, but she never turned back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brush&rdquo;</p>
<p>All of a sudden, all the bats were flying. Zeng Shushu looked at them and just released his mouth: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not easy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before he finished speaking, he couldn&rsquo;t speak any more, only to see the sky full of black clouds, countless bats flying to the high place, suddenly turned around, the first one rushed down like hail, hit on the six mirror aperture, but was shocked back by the six mirror aperture, and then rose a blood mist, under the light yellow light, fell to the ground in pieces.</p>
<p>The blood ran across the face. Countless horrible blood flowers flickered in the night and then fell to the ground. However, later bats seemed to be indifferent to the death of the same kind in front of them, and they still kept crashing. The four people of Qingyun gate are all pale, looking at the rare ferocious foreign body in the world.</p>
<p>Around the aperture, soon, there was a thick bat corpse that was close to half a man&rsquo;s height.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan suddenly found that the clothes behind him were all wet with cold sweat.</p>
<p>This horrible scene didn&rsquo;t last for a long time. Until the body of the bat outside the aperture was almost piled up to the height of a man, the bat group finally stopped the fierce attack. At this moment, even the Six Harmonies mirror, the luminous intensity of the aperture was dim, but it still flickered in the night, standing still.</p>
<p>The sky is full of black clouds, surrounded by the only light in the night, but still refused to leave.</p>
<p>Four people dare not even close their eyes for a while, holding their own magic weapons, dare not have a little slack.</p>
<p>But these huge groups of bats seem to have no good way, just around refused to leave, but did not launch any more attacks.</p>
<p>It lasted until dawn.</p>
<p>When the first ray of sunshine came, it seemed that there was a call in the dark. All the bats suddenly flew up, hovered in the air for a moment, and then all flew back to the place where they flew out last night. They came and went faster. In a moment, the countless bats had disappeared.</p>
<p>The four of them relaxed slowly, but after a long time, Qi Hao did not remove the six mirror until he was sure that the bats would not come out again.</p>
<p>The aperture dissipates.</p>
<p>With a muffled sound, the bodies of bats like hills around the four people suddenly fell in from four sides and eight directions, submerging the four people in the disgusting river.</p>
<p>At that moment, Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s heart leaped, almost thinking that he had stopped breathing. At the same time, he heard a scream from the people around him. A jade hand reached out and tightly grasped his arm.</p>
<p>The strength is so great that his nails are trapped in his flesh through his clothes.</p>
<p>The pain penetrated into his heart. He turned around and looked at the frightened and beautiful woman. Her pale face brought a sense of panic in the rising sun, which made people feel an inexplicable pain.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, all the fears in his heart disappeared, even though he was still a little nervous, but his attention was attracted by Lu Xueqi in the past, just like in front of her, he must not flinch.</p>
<p>He took a step and stood in front of her.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s breathing slowly calmed down. She looked up slightly, her lips moved slightly, looked at Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s face deeply, and let go of her hand. (to be continued. )</p>
