      <p>Gray light from the edge of the cold teeth gently radiated, passing the dog Taoist&rsquo;s face. The man lying in front of him is the murderer who destroyed the blood refining hall.</p>
<p>His eyes twinkled and he seemed to have some idea of fighting. However, this opportunity was once in a blue moon. What kind of person is the ghost in ordinary times? Taoist wild dog dare not think that he can kill this man. But this time, he seems to be losing his mind. It is a good opportunity to have a big revenge.</p>
<p>The fierce light flashed in the eyes of Taoist wild dog, and the magic weapon of beast teeth fell down.</p>
<p>The wind whistling, suddenly issued a slight burst of air sharp sound, tearing the silence of the night.</p>
<p>Before the magic weapon reached his body, the wind had blown on the decadent man. His hair scattered on his forehead was blown open, revealing his face with closed eyes.</p>
<p>His face was a little pale. Taoist wild dog suddenly turned an idea in his heart. He never saw a strange man like a ghost. He didn&rsquo;t know exactly what it was that could make this seemingly strong man die.</p>
<p>However, he did not want to know that in his mind, the blood refining hall has always been a very important existence, which is even far more important than the old man who was in charge of the power of the blood refining hall. Therefore, after being forced into a desperate situation by the ghost, the old man and others fell one after another, but only the wild dog Taoist unexpectedly insisted.</p>
<p>And now, it&rsquo;s a great opportunity for revenge!</p>
<p>The wild dog Taoist priest has already begun to imagine the scene of blood spraying out and splashing on his face. At the moment of electric light and flint, he suddenly thought: if you kill this man, the little ring behind her, will she be sad? Maybe, she will ignore me from now on</p>
<p>After all, between Xiaohuan and Guili, there is a past that the Taoist doesn&rsquo;t know about. But just seeing Xiaohuan insist on taking Guili to take care of him, we can know the relationship between them.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how. In the mind is disorderly, at that moment, the mind has turned innumerable ideas. But the tooth in my hand. But in the end, it&rsquo;s still breaking through the sky!</p>
<p>See, to that decadent man&rsquo;s throat, will penetrate into.</p>
<p>A huge arm suddenly came out of the darkness.</p>
<p>Silent. Just like a ghost, he suddenly appeared in front of the wild dog Taoist priest. Before waiting for the wild dog Taoist to react, the huge palm suddenly grasped the wild dog Taoist&rsquo;s beast tooth magic weapon in his hand.</p>
<p>The powerful momentum of the tooth still took the giant hand down one point, but that was only one point. After that, the whole tooth was like a cast iron. It was held in the hand by the giant hand and could not move. It stopped at the mouth of the ghostly throat and almost pierced the neck. However, no matter how the wild dog Taoist can use his power to cast the Dharma, he can&rsquo;t go any further.</p>
<p>The wild dog Taoist priest was shocked and looked up. For a moment, he only felt that his blood was cold. In the darkness above him, three burning flames appeared, showing a triangular shape, especially the top one, with solemn golden color and strange and fierce blood red.</p>
<p>When the wild dog Taoist breaks his head, he doesn&rsquo;t know why the gold and the red of the blood swallowing power can be mixed together. But at the moment, what he can know is that the monster in the dark can grasp his teeth with only one hand, which is not his enemy.</p>
<p>And around the invisible darkness, suddenly also like silent roar general. It&rsquo;s like some kind of monster roars. In a flash, the darkness rushes up and it seems to swallow him up.</p>
<p>The wild dog Taoist didn&rsquo;t dare to stay any longer. Almost subconsciously, he let go of the beast tooth magic weapon in his hand. He turned around and flew backward, just at the moment when he flew out. A strong wind from the top to the bottom, he stood in the original place to break a big hole, issued a huge bang, the whole small hill seemed to shake up.</p>
<p>In the distance, Zhouxian and Xiaohuan wake up at the same time. In the twinkling of an eye, they can only see the body of Taoist wild dog flying back and falling near the fire. After landing, they still can&rsquo;t stand stably, and they stagger for a while, and then they step back.</p>
<p>On his face, there was also a look of panic. He said in a astringent voice: &ldquo;monsters, monsters&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the same time, the fairy and the little ring looked back at each other, and after a while, they turned pale.</p>
<p>In the darkness, in the place where the ghost lay, a huge figure slowly appeared, with both feet on the ground and arms over the knees. At a glance, it was at least four or five feet high, far higher than the people present. People looked up slowly and finally could only look up.</p>
<p>On the top of that place, the three burning flames turned out to be the monster&rsquo;s eyes. The huge and sharp fangs appeared in its mouth, and the muscular body seemed to be full of killing intention everywhere.</p>
<p>On Monday, the immortal took a cold breath and said in a low voice: &ldquo;three eye spirit No, it&rsquo;s a fierce monkey with three eyes. &quot;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan was surprised and said, &ldquo;what do you say, grandfather? Is it ash? &quot;</p>
<p>Monday immortal hummed, a small ring pulled back, but the mouth of the wild dog Taoist angry way: &ldquo;what did you do, to offend this monster?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wild dog Taoist was silent.</p>
<p>When the monkey was about to roar, his eyes suddenly roared, but he was angry.</p>
<p>Zhou Yixian and other three people ran away with no face. At the moment, Xiao Hui, who was turned into a giant ape, seems to have been touched by the behavior of the wild dog Taoist who intends to harm his master secretly. His eyes are full of malice, and his attack does not leave a trace of affection.</p>
<p>The three of them avoided it. Xiaohui&rsquo;s huge hand had already hit it. With a bang, another big pit appeared on the thick ground. Even the bonfire nearby was immediately scattered by this big force. The ashes of the fire were flying all over the sky, which made Xiaohui&rsquo;s huge body like a legendary devil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ooh!&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The angry Beast roared, waved his right hand, and a flash of gray light flashed. He rushed to the wild dog Taoist priest like a wind and electric switch. In a flash, he was in front of the wild dog.</p>
<p>The wild dog Taoist felt that the strong wind was blowing on his face, and he was almost ready to tear his skin. He was so shocked that he tried to dodge to the side. He felt a pain in his back, but the gray light brushed through his back. The wild dog&rsquo;s body was shocked. He felt that a strong force was pouring from behind him. His throat was sweet and a mouthful of blood was gushing out.</p>
<p>In the corner of his eyes, he saw the gray light, which was his magic weapon of beast teeth.</p>
<p>Not waiting for him to laugh bitterly. The giant ape&rsquo;s huge body suddenly appeared above him, roaring down. The wild dog Taoist still wanted to avoid, but his body was sour. He could not move, so he had to sigh and die.</p>
<p>Seeing that Xiaohui is about to tear the wild dog to pieces, the huge body suddenly falls from the air. Monday immortal and Xiaohuan stand beside in amazement. at a loss. Suddenly, a strange change took place in Xiao Hui&rsquo;s body. His huge body suddenly tilted to the back. Then, in a very strange and funny posture, he plopped with his buttocks down and sat on the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bang!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This sitting is still full of momentum and prestige. Xiao Hui&rsquo;s mouth &ldquo;woo&rdquo; called, and was obviously confused. He grabbed his head with his huge hand. Look around.</p>
<p>On Monday, Xianhe and Xiaohuan, as well as the lucky dog Taoist, also looked at him.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know when he wakes up. Suddenly he appears behind Xiaohui with a lonely look on his face. But his right hand grabs Xiaohui&rsquo;s tail. It seems that he pulled Xiaohui down from the air just at the critical moment, thus saving the life of Taoist priest dingou.</p>
<p>Xiao Hui&rsquo;s three eyes blinked and suddenly growled at the man who was only half his height. He shook his head gently.</p>
<p>Xiao Hui&rsquo;s body suddenly shakes for a while. After a moment, he only hears the clattering sound of bones. In the gaping eyes of Zhouxian and others, the huge strange ape suddenly shrinks. After a while, the original huge body changed into the original lovely three eyed monkey, looked around for a moment on the ground, and then ran to the ghost&rsquo;s shoulder with a whoosh.</p>
<p>Ghost Li slowly stretched out his hand, touched the monkey&rsquo;s head, small gray three eyes strange eyes a turn. It seems that quite unwilling to look, &ldquo;squeak&rdquo; two times, at the same time to the wild dog Taoist priest pointed.</p>
<p>The wild dog Taoist was shocked, but he found that Gui Li also looked at him. Then he heard him say, &ldquo;do you want to kill me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taoist wild dog&rsquo;s face was changeable and uncertain, and he felt the surprised look of the little ring beside him. But somehow, under that vision, he felt a burst of unspeakable sadness in his heart, and he could not help but roar out of his mouth</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am going to kill you! You have destroyed one of my blood refining hall and killed many of my brothers. Should I avenge you today? &quot;</p>
<p>GUI Li didn&rsquo;t speak. He just looked at him coldly, but the little ash on his shoulder was quiet now. He called in a squeak, as if laughing at a wild dog.</p>
<p>The wild dog was not at ease when he was looked at by the ghost, but the silence of the little ring beside him made him more uneasy. Under the ordeal, he bit his teeth and said angrily: &ldquo;you want to kill, kill, what do you want to see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gradually, he withdrew his eyes from the fierce wild dog in front of him, and his expression gradually changed.</p>
<p>A little bleak, a little lonely, a little sad, a little painful</p>
<p>&ldquo;What am I going to do to kill you? If I can save her, I will kill people all over the world. I have already killed you&hellip;&rdquo; He whispered to himself in a low voice, &ldquo;what have I done besides killing people for ten years? What am I still alive for? &quot;</p>
<p>His face was pale and his body slowly turned. He even ignored others and walked alone.</p>
<p>The wild dog Taoist was shocked. The little ring standing beside him suddenly changed his face and ran after him. Zhou Xian was so surprised that he reached out to catch it, only to find it empty.</p>
<p>I saw a small ring a trot catch up with the ghost, a grasp of the ghost&rsquo;s hand, way: &ldquo;what&rsquo;s wrong with you, where are you going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li was asked by her like this, but for a time, she only felt that the whole world was suddenly shocked, only those four words roared!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you going Where are you going Where are you going?&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I Where can I go? &quot;</p>
<p>The man, suddenly looked up at the sky!</p>
<p>The dark sky curtain was deep and endless. There was no light. The darkness all over the sky and the ground rushed down, drowning his figure</p>
<p>Where should I go</p>
<p>In the dark, there is a whisper, low asked.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Qilidong, the border area of Southern Xinjiang.</p>
<p>A desolate atmosphere enveloped the whole valley. Countless Miao people came from all directions and stood on both sides of the road leading to the altar in the middle of the mountain. There were old people, children, strong men and women. All eyes, there are endless sadness, some women began to cry slowly, soon, choking sound from the crowd around.</p>
<p>Qinglong follows Tu Magu, the leader of the Miao people. Solemnly holding the small blue and white urn with the ashes of the dead wizard in his hand, he walked slowly to the altar.</p>
<p>A pair of eyes, all looking at the blue and white urn above, the young man clenched his fist. The women are crying, but the old people&rsquo;s faces are only bleak.</p>
<p>Chieftain Tu Magu has been silent and gloomy, but he is obviously more able to accept this fact than other Miao people.</p>
<p>The crowd through the aisle. Through the sad eyes, the mountain breeze blows gently and blows over the small urn, as if there is a light sound, like singing, like gratification.</p>
<p>This is the land of my hometown!</p>
<p>Qinglong has long been a figure who has seen numerous big scenes, but at this moment, he is solemn and solemn. He follows the leader of tumagu step by step and goes to the front of the altar in the middle of the mountain.</p>
<p>On the platform in front of the altar. The wizard who has been standing around for a long time has gray hair, but the younger one still has black hair, but they have the same respect in their eyes.</p>
<p>It seems that the oldest wizard came up slowly, bowed deeply to Qinglong and said a few words in Miao language.</p>
<p>Qinglong didn&rsquo;t dare to ignore him, but he didn&rsquo;t know the Miao language in southern Xinjiang, so he turned his head to Tu Magu, the patriarch.</p>
<p>Tu Ma Gu said in a low voice: &ldquo;this is the white sheep wizard. Now he&rsquo;s the wizard leader at the altar. He said hello to you and thank you very much for bringing back the remains of the great wizard</p>
<p>Qinglong said solemnly: &ldquo;the great wizard is highly respected and does his best for our ghost King clan. What I do is my duty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tu Ma Gu translates his words to the white sheep wizard in a low voice. The white goat wizard nodded and took a step forward. He came to Qinglong and stretched out his hands.</p>
<p>Qinglong solemnly handed over the small blue and white urn to him.</p>
<p>The white sheep wizard took it seriously. At the moment when he took over, all the witches around suddenly broke the silence. He began to recite a strange Scripture in Miao language. His voice was dim and unreal, like a ghost whispering, like a cold moon.</p>
<p>The voice of the mantra gradually grew louder and spread far and wide, reverberating among the mountains of qilidong. From the foot of the mountain and among the crowd, there was a cry again.</p>
<p>The white goat wizard salutes Qinglong and tumagu, turns and walks to the altar with a small blue and white urn, and the other witches follow. Green Dragon looked at all this, and his ears echoed with a sob in the distance.</p>
<p>Figure Magu looks gloomy and says in a low voice: &ldquo;Miao people, thank you for sending the great wizard back to their hometown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Qinglong Su Rong said: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s very kind of the patriarch. The great wizard has great kindness to our ghost King clan. We respect our predecessors and are no inferior to you. The ghost king of our sect really wanted to escort the master back in person, but he had something to do with him, so he asked me to apologize to you. &quot;</p>
<p>Tu Ma Gu nodded and said, &ldquo;the king of ghosts is too polite. I don&rsquo;t dare to be. This way, please</p>
<p>After saying that, he stretched out his hand, but asked Qinglong to walk inside the altar.</p>
<p>Qinglong was stunned. He thought that the altar was important, and it was not for outsiders to enter and leave at will. Is there anything else the clan leader has to say to himself?</p>
<p>Just as he thought, he still walked to the other side. Sure enough, Tu Magu alone accompanied Qinglong into the altar. The other Miao samurai who accompanied him did not follow him. At the same time, the group of witches just now disappeared. I think they walked into the depths of the altar.</p>
<p>Seeing that there was no one around, Tu Ma Gu stopped, and Qinglong immediately stopped. He looked at the complicated face of the Miao clan leader in front of him and said in a low voice, &ldquo;why, clan leader, is there anything else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tu Ma Gu hesitated for a moment and said, &ldquo;I do have one more thing to ask your envoy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Qinglong said, &ldquo;please say so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tu Magu said: &ldquo;the young man who came to qilidong of Miao nationality and invited the great wizard to go there, I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going on now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Qinglong was stunned. He passed the ghostly figure in his heart and pondered for a moment. He said, &ldquo;to be honest, the young man is the deputy leader of our ghost King clan. But at this time, he was too sad, and few people knew where he was going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tu Ma Gu&rsquo;s face was disappointed, but then he was silent for a long time. He said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to ask you to meet him when you have a chance to convey a word from me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Qinglong felt a little uneasy in his heart, but he still nodded and said, &ldquo;please speak, clan leader.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tu Ma Gu looked into the dark depths of the altar, and his voice became a little flustered and said, &ldquo;please tell me that in the qilidong altar in southern Xinjiang, an old man asked him to remember his request.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Qinglong frowned. He was also a very clever person. He only heard once that it was GUI Li who promised something to the Miao people. The great wizard decided to rescue Biyao so recklessly. Unfortunately, GUI Li was not here. Otherwise, he really wanted to ask what was so important.</p>
<p>Thinking of this in his heart, Qinglong didn&rsquo;t show it on his face. He just nodded solemnly and said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t worry, I will bring it to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tu Ma Gu sighed and was about to say something more. Suddenly, he only heard a scream outside the altar.</p>
<p>This howling sound seems to come from the sky, continuous, but dreary and seems to come from the bottom of the nine secluded places, full of the meaning of killing and cutting, and there is a deep and endless ferocity in it.</p>
<p>In a flash, under the blue sky and day, the cry of ghosts among the whole qilidong mountains was loud, and the roar of countless beasts shook the valley, and thundered like waves in the sea, which engulfed the island in an instant.</p>
<p>At the same time, the two of them swept away from the altar. They could see that the blue sky had been covered by dark clouds.</p>
<p>The piercing howling still roared, and the black clouds were surging. The Miao people at the foot of the mountain were panicked. There were children, women and children screaming loudly.</p>
<p>A tight after a while of Yin wind, cold blowing from the sky black clouds, such as the arrogant devil, looking at the earth with a grim smile.</p>
<p>The sound of galloping feet finally approached, and the first huge figure appeared from the distant mountain top——</p>
<p>The white skeleton is particularly dazzling under this black cloud, but the three pairs of colorful wings behind it are very beautiful. However, such beautiful wings grow on a giant snake with only white bones except for its head, which is particularly terrifying.</p>
<p>A White Bone Demon snake, nearly three feet long, shakes the three pairs of wings on the skeleton behind him. The snake on the head of the snake breathes and puffs out a stream of black gas.</p>
<p>A moment later, from behind the White Bone Demon snake, beside it, and even the rolling mountains and mountains around qilidong, in the endless cry of ghosts, there were countless strange monsters and strange people, whistling, grimacing, waving weapons and dancing their claws, and rushed down the mountain to the valley, frightening people.</p>
<p>And now, above the sky, in the sound of the wind, there is a thunderbolt, a loud sound, like waves rolling, shaking the world, mixed with such a faint roar:</p>
