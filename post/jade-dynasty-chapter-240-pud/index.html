      <p>To eliminate the mountain, Tianyin temple.</p>
<p>The steep mountain road meanders and stretches in the mountains. As in the past, in the warm sunshine of this day, the head is still surging. Countless devout believers go to the temple to worship and worship the gods in their hearts. The monks of Tianyin temple are distributed all over the place, and then the common people come up. In some dangerous places on the cliffs, there are usually several monks standing in case of emergency. At the same time, the familiar monks greet and see off the people coming and going with a smile at the mountain gate, which is a peaceful scene.</p>
<p>FA Xiang, a disciple of master Puhong, who is in charge of Tianyin temple, is also standing behind the mountain gate, watching people coming and going. In his capacity, he had no need to do these lessons for a long time. However, he was kind-hearted. When he saw that his fellow monks were busy because of the large number of people, he would come to help him. This was also the case on this day.</p>
<p>However, on this day, he seemed to be in a trance and restless, but he could not tell what was wrong. Looking at the devout faces flashing in front of him, he lowered his head and recited &ldquo;Amitabha Buddha&rdquo; silently. He knew that a figure suddenly came out of the crowd and stood in front of him.</p>
<p>FA Xiang looked up and was stunned. Obviously, he didn&rsquo;t expect to see the man in front of him. Then he put on a smile and said with a smile, &ldquo;we meet again, benefactor.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The visitor was very fierce. He was standing in a long grey cloth robe among the people who came to visit him. He was not very impressive at all. The only one who was somewhat arrogant was probably the monkey who was active around him.</p>
<p>His face looked gaunt. Although he was not depressed, he didn&rsquo;t have much spirit. He just laughed at FA Xiang and said, &ldquo;brother FA Xiang, please tell me something. I want to see Master Pu Hong.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>FA Xiang said with a smile:! &quot; Don&rsquo;t worry, benefactor Zhang. Your teacher has already told you that you should come. No matter when and where, he will want to see you, please follow me Having said that, FA quite goes first.</p>
<p>GUI Li followed him silently. Along the way, you can see many temples and incense in Tianyin temple, not to mention people everywhere.</p>
<p>They walked for a while. GUI Li suddenly said to FA Xiang, &ldquo;elder martial brother FA Xiang, do you really think there is a God above the green clouds?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The Dharma minister was silent for a moment and said, &ldquo;benefactor, in my Buddhist view, there are gods everywhere, but the most important thing is still in everyone&rsquo;s mind.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>He looked at the people around him and said in a low voice, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The Dharma minister said quietly, &ldquo;benefactor&rsquo;s life experience is rough. In my opinion, if you want to find liberation, the most important thing is to &ldquo;look open&rdquo; in your heart.</p>
<p>GUI Li was silent for a long time. He did not speak any more. He led him all the way. They went through the corridor and went to the small Tianyin temple on the back mountain.</p>
<p>Outside the meditation room, FA Xiang nods to Gui Li, and GUI Li stops.</p>
<p>FA Xiang gently buckled the door. He said, &ldquo;master, it&rsquo;s the disciple FA Xiang. Today, benefactor Guili went up the mountain and came to visit.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In the meditation room, master Pu Hong&rsquo;s warm and kind voice rang out. He said, &ldquo;please come here, benefactor Guili.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>FA Xiang gently opened the door of the house, stepped back, stretched out his arm to the ghost and said in a low voice, &ldquo;please, benefactor.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>GUI Li nodded and walked into the meditation room. FA Xiang followed him and went in. Close the door behind you.</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong was still sitting on the couch as usual. He saw a fierce look on his face and said, &ldquo;here you are, benefactor.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>GUI Li had great respect for the master Puhong. He did not dare to neglect him at the moment. He bowed deeply and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong shook his head and said with a smile, &ldquo;as I said long ago, the gate of Tianyin temple is open to you. You can come at any time. What&rsquo;s more, I&rsquo;m only happy when you come here, but I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s wrong with you?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>GUI Li hesitated a little, looked up at master Pu Hong, and said, &ldquo;to be honest, master, I really want to ask you something when I come here.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong said, &ldquo;benefactor, it&rsquo;s OK to say so.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It seems that it is hard to speak, but after all, he said, &ldquo;master, is there a treasure in your temple that can be called the&rdquo; heaven and earth samsara plate &ldquo;.</p>
<p>Master Puhong was stunned. The FA Xiangmian standing beside him also showed a look of surprise. They looked at each other. Then master Puhong nodded and said, &ldquo;yes, there is this thing in the shelter temple.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The spirit of the spirit of ghosts and Li suddenly vibrated. Master Pu Hong took his look in his eyes and frowned slightly again. He said, &ldquo;excuse me, benefactor GUI Li, why did you ask about this thing all of a sudden?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>GUI Li hesitated for a moment and said, &ldquo;you know the situation of the disciples. Ten years ago, on the Qingyun Mountain, a friend of the disciple was seriously injured for the sake of his disciple, and he is still unconscious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>。</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong said: &ldquo;girl Biyao respects love and righteousness. I admire her very much.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the past ten years, I&rsquo;ve been all over the world trying to cure Biyao, but I haven&rsquo;t made any progress so far,&rdquo; he said. Although he didn&rsquo;t change his face, he couldn&rsquo;t cover up the gloomy look in his eyes.</p>
<p>After a moment&rsquo;s silence, he looked up at master Puhong and said, &ldquo;to be honest, master, I came here just a few days ago when I overheard an old man saying that there is a mysterious treasure in Tianyin temple, such as heaven and earth samsara plate, the ability to turn the hidden Yang and stabilize the soul. Maybe there is some hope that Biyao can be cured. So this is the reason why I come here with great courage Once you have used it, you will return it in person.</p>
<p>At last, GUI Li&rsquo;s lips trembled slightly. Obviously, his mood was agitated. Seeing his face change several times, he seemed hesitant, but then he stepped forward two steps, clasped his hands, and slowly knelt down in front of master Pu Hong.</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong was startled. He reached out and said in a hurry, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t do this, benefactor. Get up quickly.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Next to him, FA Xiang has already stepped forward to help GUI Li and pull him up.</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong looked at the ghost for a long time, but his face was still kind, but his eyes seemed to be a little erratic. Obviously, this treasure was very important to him, and it was hard to make a decision for a time.</p>
<p>After a while, master Pu Hong slowly joined up and said, &ldquo;benefactor, I have a word to ask you.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>GUI Li immediately said, &ldquo;master, please speak.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong looked dignified and said, &ldquo;apart from covering up my brothers, only my disciple FA Xiang knows about the heaven and earth cycle in Tianyin temple. It&rsquo;s quite secret, but I don&rsquo;t know the elder who told you about it. Who&rsquo;s the one who gave me some advice.</p>
<p>He was speechless for a long time. He whispered, &ldquo;excuse me, master. It&rsquo;s not that the disciple intentionally conceals it. In fact, the elder specifically told the disciple not to disclose his identity when he was in charge of this matter, so&hellip; &quot; At the end of the day, his voice began to fade. On the face of disappointment, anxiety loomed, obviously the heart is also very fierce, but after all, there is no more to say.</p>
<p>Ambassador Pu Hong frowned, did not speak, and bowed his head.</p>
<p>GUI Li took master Puhong&rsquo;s face and look in his eyes, and his heart was even more anxious. Before he came to Tianyin temple, he really thought about this unheard of magic weapon. If he really had such powers, it would be a rare treasure. It is natural that Tianyin temple is precious and important. It is only the reflection of master Pu Hong and others. It seems that there is no intention of refusing, but others seem to be very concerned about the source of the news.</p>
<p>The news of GUI Li was naturally heard from Monday immortal on the ancient road outside Heyang city on that day. The longer he got to know him, the more he felt that this seemingly gibberish fortune teller in the river and lake was indeed a man of great mystery. However, after he told him the news on that day, he repeatedly told him that he could never reveal himself.</p>
<p>At the moment, there are actually a few hot blood in his heart. On one hand, it is a promise to the immortal on Monday, on the other hand, it is a more important long-standing wish for ten years. For the sake of Biyao, even if there is only a glimmer of hope. He is really willing to pay to pursue anything. At this moment, he can&rsquo;t advance or retreat. In his heart, the war between heaven and man is painful for a time.</p>
<p>Fortunately, it was at this time. Master Pu Hong suddenly sighed and said, &ldquo;well, no matter who the person who told you is, you are in the world with younger martial brother Puzhi. In addition, this treasure is also Puzhi&rsquo;s younger brother&hellip;&rdquo; Master Pu Hong suddenly gave a bitter smile and stopped talking. He stood up from the Buddha&rsquo;s couch, looked at the ghosts and said, &ldquo;benefactor, you must come with me. I will take you to see a man.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>He was stunned, but when he heard master Pu Hong&rsquo;s meaning, he no longer investigated the source of the news, and had the intention of borrowing the treasure. He could not help but look over. As soon as he came to the ground, his voice trembled slightly and said, &ldquo;thank you very much.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong raised him up and said with a smile, &ldquo;benefactor, don&rsquo;t be too polite. Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo; With a wave of his robe, he walked out of the house.</p>
<p>GUI Li and FA Xiang followed him. GUI Li couldn&rsquo;t help asking, &ldquo;master, who are we going to see?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong said lightly: &ldquo;benefactor, you should know that the people often call several brothers of the old monk in the shelter temple side by side?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>GUI Li nodded his head and said, &ldquo;yes, the four great monks of Tianyin temple are&rdquo; Hong, De, Zhi, Kong &ldquo;. All of them admire each other.&rdquo; When he said the word &ldquo;wisdom&rdquo;, a complex color flashed on his face, and his voice was a little lower.</p>
<p>Both master Pu Hong and FA Xiang felt this, and naturally they didn&rsquo;t say much.</p>
<p>Master Puhong said, &ldquo;I will not tell you about Puzhi, the third younger martial brother of me. You have seen Pukong, the fourth younger martial brother. Now I want to take you to see him is Pude, my second younger martial brother.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The three of them came down from the small Tianyin temple in Houshan and entered the noisy and fragrant Tianyin temple. Along the way, the monks of Tianyin Temple naturally paid homage to the abbot. Even ordinary believers were afraid of being overjoyed and fell down. Some people even regarded master Puhong as an immortal and knelt down and kowtowed.</p>
<p>Master Puhong is a kind-hearted and kind-hearted man. He passes through the main hall with the largest number of people and turns to the northwest corner of Tianyin temple. As the three men marched along, the figure of the believer&rsquo;s gate gradually disappeared behind him, and the surroundings gradually became colder and colder. At last, when master Puhong stopped at the entrance of a quiet courtyard at the end of a path, there was no one around.</p>
<p>Looking up, I saw that the small courtyard was very simple, and the wall was covered with moss. The courtyard was half covered. People could clearly see that the small courtyard atrium was covered with dead leaves. From time to time, there was a slight wind blowing the leaves on the ground, which added a bit of desolation and antiquity.</p>
<p>On the gate of the small courtyard, there is a very broken plaque with three characters: meditation hall.</p>
<p>GUI Li looked at the plaque in silence. He seemed to be in a trance. Master Puhong walked into the courtyard, and FA Xiang followed him.</p>
<p>After a few steps, I found that the ghost behind me didn&rsquo;t seem to keep up. Looking at the tablet, he was surprised.</p>
<p>The ghost&rsquo;s body moved. It seems to have come back to God, and for a moment, he walked over and said, &ldquo;nothing, just the name on the plaque. It&rsquo;s similar to the place where I lived when I was a teenager. It&rsquo;s rude and impolite for a moment.</p>
<p>FA Xiangduo looked at him and shook his head: &ldquo;where, benefactor, please come in!&rdquo;.</p>
<p>GUI Li nodded and walked towards the deep of the courtyard. Master Pu Hong stopped in front of a wooden house in the courtyard and looked back at the three of them.</p>
<p>GUI Li stepped forward and said in a low voice, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m rude.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong smiles and says, &ldquo;no harm.&rdquo; Then he turned around and knocked three times on the wooden house.</p>
<p>He said, &ldquo;Amitabha, younger martial brother Pude, I brought a benefactor to see you today. It&rsquo;s a sin to disturb younger martial brother Qingxiu.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>A gust of wind came from behind GUI Li and others, blowing leaves all over the sky, blowing their lapels gently. In front of them, the wooden door seems to be gently pushed by the wind, making a &ldquo;squeak&rdquo; sound. It turned out that nobody was automatically opening it inward.</p>
<p>At the same time, there was an old, low and hoarse voice in the room, as if it had been rusted for too long. &ldquo;Yes Who? Can you work Elder martial brother Dong, your big Frame Ah&hellip; &ldquo;.</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong smiles and goes in. FA Xiang follows him. He feels nervous and takes a deep breath. This just stepped into the wooden house.</p>
<p>Although GUI Li knew that the monks of Tianyin temple did not value worldly luxury, and wanted to come to Tianyin temple, the decoration was very simple. However, when he entered the wooden house, he was still surprised by the simplicity. The decoration of the house is simple, but there is no decoration at all. There is only one corner of the floor covered with dry thatch. An old monk with a dark face and a thin description is sitting there with his knees crossed. He is slowly raising his eyes and thinking about their view.</p>
<p>Master Puhong stepped forward and came to the old monk. The ghost stood behind him in silence. Looking from the side, he saw that the old monk and master Puhong looked very different. Master Puhong was energetic and kind-hearted, and looked solemn and self-contained. No wonder many devout believers bowed down to worship just now. By contrast, the old monk sitting in the corner could really use Buddhism It&rsquo;s often used to describe &ldquo;Stinky skin&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Master Puhong stood in front of the old monk and looked at him for a long time. Fang slowly sighed. He sat down directly on the dirty ground in front of the old monk and said, &ldquo;younger martial brother, we haven&rsquo;t seen each other for ten years?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The old monk slowly closed, his voice was still as hoarse, deep and slow, and said, &ldquo;yes Ah, teacher Brother, you can always Good? &ldquo;.</p>
<p>When GUI Li heard the speech, he was surprised. His elder brother was in the Tianyin temple. Although the old monk&rsquo;s courtyard was remote, he didn&rsquo;t see the Tianyin Temple specially guarded all the way. It was obviously not closed. In the long ten years, they had never met. It was really incredible.</p>
<p>As if he had guessed what GUI Li was thinking, master Pu Hong turned to Gui Li with a smile and said, &ldquo;this is Pu De, the second younger martial brother of me.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Although he still didn&rsquo;t know why master Puhong wanted to bring him to see the master Pude, GUI Li, with the respect of the four eminent monks in Tianyin temple, did not dare to neglect him. He quickly saluted: &ldquo;disciple Guili, please see Master Pude.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Master Pude slowly moved his eyes and fell on his fierce face. His movements were very stiff and slow, which even made people feel that it was hard to move his eyes. GUI Li&rsquo;s heart was very puzzled how this one of the four great monks who moved the world could be like this, but he did not dare to lose his courtesy.</p>
<p>The master Pu Hong next to him said, &ldquo;younger martial brother Pude, what he has practiced is a branch of our Buddhism, which is called kuchan. People without great wisdom and courage can&rsquo;t practice. Don&rsquo;t look at his haggard appearance. But in terms of practicing Taoism, younger brother Pude is far better than me.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Master Pude&rsquo;s withered face moved slightly, and I don&rsquo;t know if he was smiling. Anyway, from the appearance, he could not see the change of his expression. He said slowly: &ldquo;elder martial brother You&rsquo;re joking&hellip; &ldquo;.</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong read &ldquo;Amitabha Buddha&rdquo; in a low voice, and then said, &ldquo;younger martial brother, I&rsquo;ve come to disturb Qingxiu a few days ago. I&rsquo;m guilty. I&rsquo;ll make amends here, but it&rsquo;s no better than others.&rdquo; at this point, he glanced at the ghost and said, &ldquo;younger martial brother, do you know who he is?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Master Pude&rsquo;s eyes have never left since he looked at the ghost just now. However, his eyes always seem to be so ancient that no one can see what he is thinking.</p>
<p>At the moment, after listening to master Pu Hong&rsquo;s words, master Pude said slowly, &ldquo;yes Who? &ldquo;.</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong sighed softly and said, &ldquo;he is the wrong that Puzhi&rsquo;s younger brother planted ten years ago. Zhang Xiaofan, a young man in the grass Temple village at the foot of Qingyun Mountain.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; For the first time, master Pude&rsquo;s words did not stop, and even his face changed slightly. After half a ring, his eyes still looked at the ghost calendar and said, &ldquo;he is The child? &ldquo;.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if the words are gradually more and more, and master Pude&rsquo;s words stop less and become more fluent. (to be continued. )</p>
