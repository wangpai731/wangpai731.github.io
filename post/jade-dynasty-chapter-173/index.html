      <p>However, the scale of the fight between Lin Yu and his friends is not as big as that of his childhood.</p>
<p>No one ever thought of it! The man who was once close to each other finally came to this point. The two men&rsquo;s figures were scattered and sometimes collided. They swept around the magic moon cave like a storm. All the trees fell down, or were uprooted or cut off. Even the hard and thick land was completely changed by the powerful skills of these two men, There are deep pits of gravel everywhere.</p>
<p>If we only talk about the magic power of Taoism, he has several real dharmas and practices three volumes of the classic book of heaven. In fact, the magic power of Taoism is not comparable to that of ordinary people. Even if it is a genius like Lin Jingyu, it is quite inferior to him.</p>
<p>But at the moment, the two fight, I don&rsquo;t know how, it is the same. In fact, there are two reasons. The first is that Lin Jingyu has a fierce temperament. In the past ten years, he has followed the mysterious old man in the ancestral hall. What he has learned is just the fierce and powerful skills to stimulate his own potential. With his nature and the momentum of cutting the Dragon sword, his fighting power is higher than his actual practice. At the moment, he was filled with resentment, and his sword took his life. He was almost as powerful as the legendary ten thousand swords a hundred years ago.</p>
<p>However, although GUI Li&rsquo;s moral conduct is high and his foundation is solid, there is a weak point that restricts him all the time. At the same time, he practiced the true method of &ldquo;Taiji xuanqingdao&rdquo; of Qingyun Taoist school and the &ldquo;great Buddhist Prajna&rdquo; of Tianyin temple at the same time, which led to their slow progress. In the future, although he was lucky enough to learn the general outline of the book of heaven, he could connect the two magic skills and make great progress in Taoism. However, the basic Dafa had been replaced by the magic classic &ldquo;Tianshu&rdquo; in the future.</p>
<p>However, this strange skill of the book of heaven is mysterious and profound, and it has some disadvantages, although the general principles are all there. However, in the book, Daofa is not complete in the three volumes. Every time I study the key points, there is a fracture. If people walk on a smooth road and the main roads come and go, suddenly there are cliffs and cliffs in front of you. You can&rsquo;t go there. You want to take another road. But there is no way. In fact, there are not a few of them. In recent years, they have been eating blood beads and fierce Qi. They are so fierce that they are unable to resist them. Most of them come from this. As a result, he could not give full play to his practice.</p>
<p>However, Rao is so. It&rsquo;s not easy to have a few real dharmas. Although the book of heaven is incomplete, it is a kind of strange skill and method to create the world. The wonders are beyond imagination.</p>
<p>After fighting for a long time, the two finally gained the upper hand gradually. They ate the blood of the Red Mansions, and gradually suppressed the light of the dragon sword.</p>
<p>Although he has not been in conflict with the evil cloud sect for ten years, he has never been in conflict with the evil cloud sect. Lin Jingyu has been practicing in the ancestral hall. Therefore, although they met once in the death swamp of Southwest China, they never fought. In Lin Jingyu&rsquo;s heart, GUI Li is actually the impression of Zhang Xiaofan, who was dull at the beginning.</p>
<p>From small to large, from Caomiao village to Qingyun Mountain. Lin Jingyu is no better than Zhang Xiaofan. Although in his heart, he always regarded Zhang Xiaofan as a brother, but unconsciously, with his pride as a child, he despised Zhang Xiaofan in many things. And for many years. Zhang Xiaofan was not as smart and handsome as he thought. When he went to Qingyun Mountain, many teachers were eager to take him as his apprentice, but no one paid attention to Zhang Xiaofan. In the future, they parted ways. He went to dragon head peak, Zhang Xiaofan went to Dazhu peak, and Taoism was far away from him.</p>
<p>This kind of situation shows that Zhang Xiaofan can&rsquo;t compare with him. However, when he came to Qingyun Mountain seven pulse Martial Arts Association, Zhang Xiaofan somehow got lucky and even got into the top four. However, he met his senior brother Qi Hao at that time and was defeated. Although he was a little depressed, people knew the reason at that time, and Lin Jingyu didn&rsquo;t change his mind. For a long time, he looked at Zhang Xiaofan as a brother. When Zhang Xiaofan was cheated, he also stood up in awe, as if he was taking care of his incompetent brother.</p>
<p>Until today&rsquo;s breakup, life and death fight, Lin Jingyu is surprised to find that the original has been under their own people, unknowingly has been better than their own appearance.</p>
<p>A fire of nameless anger, from the heart of Huoran, Lin Jingyu&rsquo;s handsome face, suddenly some ferocious. The only disadvantage of his arrogance was that he was too fond of going to extremes. For a moment, he could not accept the fact.</p>
<p>Green light suddenly rises, such as the roar of a proud dragon, angry and bite back.</p>
<p>In the fierce struggle, they could see the purple light column circling between them. Because the seal of heaven had been broken, it was more than several times thicker than just now. It was purple and covered both of them.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu is at a disadvantage, but he suddenly counterattacks, and his sword power is like an avalanche. GUI Li was startled and watched Lin Jingyu walk with the sword. Although the sword was very powerful, it had already ignored his own safety and was as fierce as a fight.</p>
<p>GUI Li&rsquo;s brows are frowning. It&rsquo;s been some time since they started to fight. Maybe it&rsquo;s because this is the holy land of Qingyun Mountain, and there is a purple gas column caused by the ancient sword of killing immortals. At first, the anger aroused in Gui Li&rsquo;s heart did not control his mind as usual. On the contrary, his pure skill gradually subsided, and his mind gradually returned to Qingming.</p>
<p>But the sky above him was the sword array for killing immortals. He had thought of it all day and night for ten years. It was really unforgettable. The figure of Biyao was constantly shaking in front of his eyes, which was also heartbreaking. The man in front of him, after he had a clear mind, remembered his friendship for many years. At the moment, most of his anger was caused by himself. When he thought of the old man in the ancestral hall, he felt a little ashamed. As a result, he gradually lost the heart of fighting.</p>
<p>With a long sigh, he was so upset that he didn&rsquo;t want to fight any more. He just felt that he was in great pain and wanted to leave. He wanted to go back to Huqi mountain in a twinkling of an eye to see Biyao and tell her something about her.</p>
<p>At this time, Lin Jingyu in front of him is already a sword out of thin air, sharp roaring, green light like electricity, piercing the sky. His face sank and he stepped back for three steps. The soul eating magic stick was chopped down and was on the blade of the dragon sword.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu&rsquo;s body was shocked. He only felt that a strange and incomparable bloody anger was coming from the black stick which looked like a firecracker. At the same time, he had a strange adsorption force, which even affected the blood essence of his body and was about to surge out. It&rsquo;s almost impossible for me.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu was shocked. He knew that it was the most evil and fierce magic weapon in Gui Li&rsquo;s hands. However, he had a strong nature and was happy and fearless. The sword is like a dragon at the bottom of the sword. It rises against the sword. Regardless of its own chest opening, it directly attacks the GUI Li front door.</p>
<p>His eyes flickered. At the moment, if he shot, although he could not avoid serious injury, he was sure to kill Lin Jingyu. He just looked at the familiar face, and suddenly his fierce heart flashed over the figure where they were playing together, and then there was the face of Biyao.</p>
<p>In this world, how many people can I cherish and still live in the world?</p>
<p>As if to laugh at himself, he asked himself with a wry smile.</p>
<p>Take back the soul devouring magic wand, rise from the critical crisis and hide in the past. But his bitter smile looks in Lin Jingyu&rsquo;s eyes, but it is like a sneer, which makes him angry.</p>
<p>At this time, the body in the middle of the sky suddenly body a shock, looking to the distance, saw a white figure, as fast as lightning floating over. After seeing the situation in the field, the man seemed to be shocked. On his beautiful face, there was a mixture of surprise and joy and a look of sadness and joy. Even the voice trembled slightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You It&rsquo;s really you&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Lu Xueqi.</p>
<p>On her snow-white cheek, I do not know when to start, for the first time in her life, two drops of tears slipped quietly in front of people.</p>
<p>The man, looking at himself in amazement. Slowly falling in the air, so familiar face, how many years of unforgettable missing?</p>
<p>When I thought he was dead after all, how sad and painful was it? If it was not for the outsider at the moment, I would like to rush into his arms and have a good cry.</p>
<p>Who wants to live alone?</p>
<p>Who wants to live alone?</p>
<p>If it is not difficult to control the deep feelings, how can you be so tender and cold as frost!</p>
<p>GUI Li was also a bit stunned. Zhang opened his mouth as if he wanted to say something, but he didn&rsquo;t say anything. Unexpectedly at this time, Lin Jingyu did not stop behind him. The sword of cutting the dragon was like wind and fire. In the sound of shouting, it still swept over.</p>
<p>GUI Li suddenly woke up and turned over to meet the enemy. He had lost his first chance. Seeing the dazzling green light, he was about to rush to the front of him. The fierce spirit on the ghost&rsquo;s face was very strong, and the blood sucking beads turned red instantly.</p>
<p>At this critical juncture, suddenly, as if the memory of a while ago, you wake up again.</p>
<p>A white palm stretched out from the side and held the sharp wrist.</p>
<p>Suddenly, all of a sudden, the strength of the body seems to have disappeared. A passion that is about to burst out from the deepest place surges into my heart. There is a buzzing sound in the deep of my mind. Suddenly, I turn back, and a &ldquo;Biyao&rdquo; is about to shout out.</p>
<p>But he was stunned and stopped. In front of him, the white dress was fluttering. It was Lu Xueqi.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Choking&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is like a phoenix singing in the sky. It is clear and pleasant to hear. The Tianya sword flows like autumn water and comes out of its scabbard. One sword blocks the irresistible dragon sword, and Lu Xueqi blocks himself in front of the ghost.</p>
<p>On that beautiful and gorgeous face, tenderness is infinite, but where to manage, this world all?</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu said angrily, &ldquo;sister Lu, are you crazy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi body a shock, as if from a dream to wake up in general, and then, she silently turned her head, looking at the ghost, eyes blurred and soft, a smile, she slowly let go of the ghostly hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crazy&hellip;&rdquo; Lu Xueqi, with a faint smile in her eyes, said in a low voice: &ldquo;I must have been crazy a long time ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fierce Qi dissipated on his face, and only the meaning of pain swept over his face and hung his head in silence.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu was shocked. In the field, there was silence for a moment.</p>
<p>At this moment, suddenly, there was a great noise from the sky, and the mountains suddenly vibrated violently. They were not able to stand on their feet in such a way.</p>
<p>All three were startled. They looked up at the sky and saw that the great disaster had finally reached the last moment.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>The blazing white light was so dazzling that no one could see the figure in that halo. People just see that the bright light in the sky lights up the whole sky, and even the sunrise at the edge of the sky finally loses its color.</p>
<p>On the whole sky, there is only one main sword left in the once magnificent Zhuxian sword array, but the hidden power is more powerful than the sword shadow all over the sky. From the white sword to the white sword, it seems that the whole white sword will change from white to white.</p>
<p>In the wind, the beast God stands on the sky. Looking at the sword in front of me that shouldn&rsquo;t appear in the world, I feel a little confused on my ferocious face.</p>
<p>In the eyes of thousands of people looking forward to, in the cheers of thousands of people like carnival, the huge blazing sword. Push slowly, turn your head and face the beast God. In a short time, the black air around the beast God was forced back by the naturally hostile white light.</p>
<p>Deep in the white light, it was as if someone was breathing deeply. The voice is hoarse, such as the roar of a beast or the roar of a trapped animal.</p>
<p>The beast God was staring at the sword and the white light in front of him. After a long time, he burst out laughing. His voice was hoarse and ugly. At the moment, he laughed, which was even more harsh. All the listeners looked at him.</p>
<p>The beast God laughed and looked crazy. It seems that in his mind, there are some of the most ridiculous things in the world, but after all, he just laughs wildly and doesn&rsquo;t say a word more.</p>
<p>On the sky, the wind is more and more fierce, and the power of the sword of killing immortals is becoming more and more powerful. I don&rsquo;t know when it started. It seems that a voice came from the heaven and earth, singing the mysterious mantra in a low voice, and began to reverberate between the heaven and the earth.</p>
<p>The blazing white light. Suddenly, it rose in the sky and fell on the hilt of the shining sword for killing immortals. Almost at the same time, the array of killing immortals had already started. It seems that there is no place to hide in the sky or underground.</p>
<p>Kill the gods and kill the gods!</p>
<p>Today is the world. There is no such momentum.</p>
<p>No one will know what he is thinking of in the heart of the beast God who is facing this sword?</p>
<p>However, he did not have the slightest fear, nor did he have the slightest intention to retreat. Facing the wind and the light, the giant body of the beast God jumped up and flew to the face of the sword of killing immortals.</p>
<p>Heaven and earth seem to be silent. People are holding their breath. People stare at the blue sky. Black and white cross the sky and collide with each other!</p>
<p>No one can describe the scene at that time. The sky collapsed and the earth cracked. The Qingyun Mountain Mountains vibrated three times in a day, this time the most powerful one. There were countless cracks and cracks between the huge mountain peaks and cliffs, and countless boulders fell off the mountain and fell down one after another. In the cold pool of clear water on Tongtian peak, the water waves are turbulent. The originally smooth water surface constantly rushes up several Zhang high water column.</p>
<p>At the top of Qingyun Mountain, the people and the remaining monsters in the right path are all silent, especially those monsters that are not beasts. At the moment, they are even more frightened, manic and angry.</p>
<p>However, compared with the earth shaking scene in the sky, it seems that none of them is any more important, and no one will care about it.</p>
<p>The huge sword of killing immortals runs across the sky and lunges under it. Where I passed by, I saw a sharp sound in the air. All the things along the way all disappeared, leaving no trace. On the outside of the blade of the crazy sword, you can see that the outer edge of the white light is dark red. I don&rsquo;t know whether the air is rubbing too hard or the crazy sword itself is too fierce.</p>
<p>The sword roared down, and the beast God roared up to the sky. All his arms were closed to his chest, and his strange eyes were wide open. At the moment when the immortal killing master&rsquo;s sword was stabbed, he was astonished by the black air, the strange hand stretched out, and the thunder roared in the sky. He actually grasped this divine sword which could open the sky.</p>
<p>In an instant, the sky and the earth were all in awe.</p>
<p>However, the white light was rising, and the huge sword of killing the immortals was thundering. From dozens of black hands like iron hoops, it was abruptly and slowly inserted!</p>
<p>One inch, one inch, another.</p>
<p>One by one, the black hands were slowly engulfed and dissipated by the blazing white light. At the moment, the crazy sword looked like the supreme evil god. It took people&rsquo;s lives with open teeth and claws. With endless killing intention, it inserted into the chest of the beast God bit by bit.</p>
<p>The black air flickered and roared to the sky. The black blood sprayed out. The sword of killing the immortal finally penetrated into the beast God&rsquo;s chest, and it had already been inserted one by one. The blazing white light flashed fiercely, like the lightning in the sky, hitting the beast God&rsquo;s skin.</p>
<p>Skin, flesh and blood, all quietly fade away, the huge body, as if also began to illusory, is about to be broken into void by the force of the sky shaking. The light in the eyes of the beast God was getting weaker and weaker, and he was finally defeated by these peerless swords.</p>
<p>Under the sword of killing immortals, his body became smaller and smaller, but somehow, it seemed to be the consumption of strength. As the body of the beast God became smaller and smaller, the original huge sword of killing immortals began to shrink. Only the brilliance was still so bright.</p>
<p>This has been going on. Until the beast God finally changed into the size of an ordinary man, the black air shrouded for a moment, then suddenly dispersed, and people saw it vividly. He turned back to the boy&rsquo;s appearance again, but now he looks pale and his hair is in disorder. It is obvious that he is doomed to lose.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, it&rsquo;s almost at the same time that the black gas is gone. The sword of the master of killing immortals dissipated, but the brilliance condensed in front of the beast God, flickering and finally converging between them. The ancient sword of killing immortals, which is like stone instead of stone, like jade but not jade, comes out, and is inserted into the chest of the beast God and comes out.</p>
<p>The figure of daoxuan real man appeared slowly from the light, but his cheek was not the same as that of daoguxianfeng, but suddenly fierce. His eyes were red with blood.</p>
<p>The beast God gasped and coughed, and his lips trembled slightly. He looked down at his chest.</p>
<p>Zhuxian sword is inserted in his heart. The blood flowing from the middle is not red.</p>
<p>He laughed miserably and sighed, &ldquo;great Now I can&rsquo;t afford it!&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>Suddenly, the voice fell and his hands closed. At the moment, his body has returned to the normal appearance, and his arms are straight as normal people. But with this combination, the ancient sword of Zhuxian is clamped in the palm of his hand. At that time, however, he saw the black gas surging into the blade of the ancient sword Zhuxian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Card!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A low voice almost can&rsquo;t be heard came from the blade of Zhuxian ancient sword. Daoxuan&rsquo;s face changed greatly. He looked at it and saw only the ancient sword. There is a crack clearly, which is on the Zhuxian sword.</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan&rsquo;s surprise was extraordinary. He roared and pulled out his sword with all his strength. Almost at the same time, at the moment when the ancient sword of Zhuxian was pulled away from the beast God&rsquo;s chest, it seemed that the pain hit his heart. The beast God also roared, and his voice was sad. The whole man rose from the air and flew backward.</p>
<p>At the moment, immortal daoxuan felt that his blood and blood were surging in his mind like a raging wave, and a stream of murderous anger was rolling back and forth as if he wanted to break through his chest. However, he was deeply cultivated and knew that he could not let the tiger return to the mountain in any case. What&rsquo;s more, he forced to open the seal of heaven and the earth&rsquo;s aura was too strong, which had already overburdened the ancient sword of Zhuxian. Just now he was hit by the demon beast and left a crack.</p>
<p>At the moment, he forced a breath and was about to catch up with him. Suddenly, he felt a huge force coming from the sword of Zhuxian sword, which rushed into his mind. In an instant, he broke through the acupoints of his meridians, which he had practiced for hundreds of years, and roared. For a moment, his body trembled, and his seven orifices began to bleed. He shook his body twice and yelled. He loosened the ancient sword of Zhuxian and fell down from the clouds.</p>
<p>The shocking scene dazzled and stunned the people below. Suddenly, he saw a great change. The beast God fled, but immortal daoxuan suddenly fainted, and all of them were in a mess.</p>
<p>For a while, some people went to chase the animal God, others rushed to rescue daoxuan immortal, and some young disciples woke up from the shock. Suddenly, they found that there were countless animal demons on the Tongtian peak, and they killed them immediately. How could the animal spirits willingly arrest them? For a time, it was a sound of killing.</p>
<p>But in this chaos, suddenly someone screamed out, the voice was urgent and flustered, as if to see the most terrible thing in life: &ldquo;kill the immortal What about the sword? Where did Zhuxian sword fall</p>
<p>In an instant, there was a great disturbance on Tongtian peak, and countless people were in a mess.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Back mountain boundary.</p>
<p>The purple gas column in the magic moon cave slowly dissipates, leaving only a little auspicious gas left. The scene in the sky just now was so exciting that all three of them were stunned.</p>
<p>At this moment, they came to their senses.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu took a deep breath, calmed down, and said coldly to Lu Xueqi, &ldquo;sister Lu, what do you want? Do you want to betray your school, too? &quot;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi was stunned. She wanted to say something, but she turned her head and looked at the ghost. After all, she didn&rsquo;t say anything.</p>
<p>GUI Li took a deep look at her. They looked at each other as if they had seen each other deeply</p>
<p>GUI Li smiles, turns his head, faces Lin Jingyu, and stands in front of Lu Xueqi again.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi looked at the back from behind, her eyes shining, complicated and hard to see.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu smiles coldly, and then he wants to start.</p>
<p>At this time, suddenly only listen to the sky a sharp scream, whistling.</p>
<p>All of them were surprised. As soon as they gave way, they saw something falling from the sky, which seemed to be slow, solid and fast, and landed on the ground with a sound of &ldquo;puff&rdquo;. The originally hard stone slab was like tofu, which was deeply inserted into it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a long sword. It&rsquo;s a strange sword. It&rsquo;s like stone or stone. It&rsquo;s simple. Only on the blade with a thin crack, there are two words clearly carved on it: Zhuxian! (to be continued. )</p>
