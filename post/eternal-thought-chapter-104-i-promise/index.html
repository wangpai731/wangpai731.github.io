      <p>With melancholy, Bai Xiaochun went back to the cave, where he sighed and sighed, and finally sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If a person is too good, it&rsquo;s not a good thing. It&rsquo;s just like me. Zongmen are worried that they have exempted me from the task of ten years and give me some contribution every month.&rdquo; Bai xiaochunmei is worried and thinks that she is really excellent. What should I do if she goes on like this</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all. Since I&rsquo;m not allowed to perform the task, I&rsquo;ll refine the medicine. Originally, I did the task to earn contribution points.&rdquo; When Bai Xiaochun thought of this place, she felt that she had sacrificed herself for her family and entered the refining pharmacy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We should master the refining methods of all the third-order elixir!&rdquo; As soon as he stepped into the refining pharmacy, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s look became serious.</p>
<p>As time went by, half a year passed in a twinkling of an eye.</p>
<p>In the past six months, Bai Xiaochun spent every day refining alchemy in the pharmacy except for a fixed time of practice. When he had no material, he went to exchange it with his contribution point. Gradually, the whole person became a little crazy. He was very unskilled in mastering all the three level miracles and never gave up.</p>
<p>Many people in the clan were relieved because Bai Xiaochun stopped carrying out the task and gradually returned to normal. The leader, Zheng Yuandong, finally felt much quieter. He thought that his behavior of exempting Bai Xiaochun from the ten-year task was very correct.</p>
<p>Not only is he like this here, but also the palm seats and elders including Li Qinghou on the south bank are gradually relieved. Even at a regular meeting of the three mountains on the south bank, these foundation building friars also talked about Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bai Xiaochun, the child, has been refining medicine recently, and his family has recovered as usual.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Refining medicine is a good thing. Let him make it. Refining medicine is the safest and will not affect other people.&rdquo; All of them were smiling, and they were deeply moved by the tranquility of the past six months.</p>
<p>However, the emotion did not last long. A few days later, a loud noise spread all over Xiangyun mountain. It was heard from Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s cave. It made countless inner disciples wake up and even the outer disciples were shocked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God, is it possible that someone attacked our Lingxi clan!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just when the crowd was in uproar, Bai Xiaochun coughed and ran out of the refining pharmacy in the cave. Her face was black, her nose was full of tears, and she jumped into the spring to wash it. Then she crept out with a frown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It blew up?&rdquo; He was as like as two peas in the cave. He was a regular object of the disciples. Although it was a standard, it could be exactly the same as the medicine making cabinet. According to the theory, even if the elixir was scrapped, the Dan stove would not be blown up.</p>
<p>But just now, the cauldron exploded, and even the formation of the cave was inspired.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun couldn&rsquo;t understand it. He sighed deeply and began to practice the Dragon elephant sea Sutra. With his practice in this period of time, his accomplishments were about to break through.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun is not in a hurry. After practicing the Dragon elephant sea Sutra, he swallows the elixir to increase vitality. He runs the immortal longevity work. The silver light of his whole body is more bright and faint. It seems that there will be a trace of gold.</p>
<p>It was not until noon that Bai Xiaochun took a deep breath and stopped his skill. He stood in the cave. After closing his eyes, his hands were raised and his body was running the formula of shuize kingdom. After half a column of incense, his eyes suddenly opened and roared forward.</p>
<p>An amazing momentum suddenly dispersed from him, as if the surrounding environment had changed, and there was a mist, but only lasted for a breath, all of which disappeared in an instant.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun has some weakness, wipe off the sweat, he practices almost every day in this water country, but now, he has only a trace of momentum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I still have to work hard.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun took a break. After finishing today&rsquo;s practice, he thought about the explosion of the furnace. In the past six months, he tried to refine the third-order elixir, but most of them failed.</p>
<p>Let him is very helpless, at this moment ponder for a long time, vaguely found the reason why the furnace blew up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it the instability after the drug&rsquo;s intensification that caused the outbreak?&rdquo; Thinking deeply, Bai Xiaochun immediately went out and returned to the furnace with his contribution point and continued refining.</p>
<p>And the people in Xiangyun mountain gradually realized that the roar before came from Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s cave. They looked strange. Although they didn&rsquo;t know how the sound was formed, they could barely accept it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just A few days later, Bai Xiaochun was in the refining pharmacy of the cave. He was concentrating on controlling the elixir in the furnace. However, the difficulty of the three levels of elixir was too great. Other people made it with experience and luck. It was a very high attainments that he could make three times out of ten times. However, Bai Xiaochun pursued the ultimate goal. He would never give up until he solved all the problems To a detail, there are often many experiments, so there is a conflict.</p>
<p>At this moment, his eyes suddenly widened, and he felt that the elixir in the furnace was out of control. What&rsquo;s more, he saw a crack in the furnace. Bai Xiaochun took a breath and left the refining pharmacy in an instant.</p>
<p>Almost at the moment when he left, there was a strong roar coming from the sky.</p>
<p>The whole Xiangyun mountain was filled with uproar. It was not easy for them to bear it one by one. But then, three days later, Bai Xiaochun screamed in the refining pharmacy. After escaping quickly, the third roar rose, which was even more amazing.</p>
<p>In particular, seven days later, when Bai Xiaochun was refining pills, he suddenly took a breath and started to escape at full speed. Behind him, the fourth roar was deafening, and the whole refining pharmacy collapsed.</p>
<p>Xiangyun mountain was completely shaken, and all the disciples&rsquo; eyes were red. After inquiring one by one, they all knew that Bai Xiaochun was refining alchemy. But they didn&rsquo;t understand how the alchemy was conducted, and such a loud noise came out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I asked the elixir hall. Bai Xiaochun has changed seven or eight Dan stoves these days!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That voice is the sound of the explosion of the furnace. What is Bai Xiaochun refining? Damn it, he is not afraid to blow himself up!&rdquo; In the anger of all the people, there was a roar It&rsquo;s not over. It&rsquo;s coming out one after another.</p>
<p>In a month, there were seven loud noises coming out of Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s cave, one after another. Especially at the last time, the whole Xiangyun mountain rocked, and Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s cave was almost exploded.</p>
<p>When Bai Xiaochun ran out in a hurry, both the inner and outer disciples of Xiangyun mountain were in a state of madness. For a month, they did not even dare to practice. Every time they were awakened, their hearts pounded wildly, and they were in a trance. Their tormented eyes were bloodstained, and they could hardly control their anger.</p>
<p>In particular, even the sound insulation array seems not to have a good effect on the sound, which makes all the disciples angry, even the elders are shocked. Bai Xiaochun, who caused all this, feels incredible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the sound of the furnace exploding. Is Bai Xiaochun refining medicine? He What is he refining? &quot;</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t end. In the second month, the voice became louder and roared continuously. It was heard more than ten times, almost once every two days. Until the disciples of Xiangyun mountain could not bear it, they went crazy. They killed Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s cave together, and there was a roar.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun was aggrieved and quickly came out to explain. Looking at thousands of disciples outside the cave, he looked pale. Finally, he patted his small chest vigorously to ensure that there would never be another time. This calmed the public anger.</p>
<p>When they go back to the pharmacy, they are sad.</p>
<p>A few days later, he suddenly patted his thigh, his eyes shining.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way, there must be no warm stove!&rdquo; He thought of this, immediately excited, try again Three days later, all the people in Xiangyun mountain heard another sound Earth shaking roar.</p>
<p>One of the inner disciples almost collapsed in fear. He burst out with his hair in his hair and gave out a shrill roar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bai Xiaochun!! Even if you are Tianjiao</p>
<p>It was not only him, but soon, in the middle of the night, almost all the inner disciples rushed out. Even Zhou Xinqi appeared tired and went straight to Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s cave. After Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s repeated promises with a smile on her face, they were helpless. Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s attitude was so good that they didn&rsquo;t know what to do. If the attitude was not good, it was OK to say that there was no big fight Now It can only be accepted by gritting teeth.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun returned to the cave tired of tears. He felt that it was very difficult to adhere to his ideal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will never give up As soon as he gritted his teeth, he took out a furnace again and stared at it. This time he pondered for half a month. He had looked for all the problems and even pondered over every detail for a long time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ground fire, it must be the ground fire!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun suddenly raised his head with blood in his eyes, refining again Five days later, in the early morning, Li Qinghou was stunned by a loud noise that even ziding mountain and Qingfeng mountain heard came out from Xiangyun mountain.</p>
<p>In particular, Zhou Nei Qi was shocked by the white feather of the whole disciple</p>
<p>At the same time, all the formations of Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s cave were opened at the same time, and a burst of ground fire broke out, even triggering the big array of Xiangyun mountain. When Bai Xiaochun struggled to climb out, his whole body was pitch black, but there was excitement in his eyes. He finally found out the reason.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not the earth fire that causes it, but the mutual generation and mutual restraint of the elixir, which causes infinite changes. It&rsquo;s the third-order pill We have paid attention to the method of mutual generation and mutual restraint! &quot;</p>
<p>Soon, Xiangyun mountain went up to the elders and down to the outer disciples. All of them went out to kill Bai Xiaochun. Everyone had stones in their hands, and were glared at by tens of thousands of people. Bai Xiaochun got up uneasily and beat her chest hard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I promise&hellip;&rdquo; Before he finished his words, there were many tens of thousands of people who immediately threw stones. After all, they were the same family and would not fight here, but stones can still be used</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep your head up!&rdquo; Innumerable stones with anger roared.</p>
