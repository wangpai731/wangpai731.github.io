      <p>Morning bell, evening drum, day after day, as if endless.</p>
<p>Every day is as like as two peas. Yesterday, some people feel boring. Some feel peaceful and quiet.</p>
<p>In a twinkling of an eye, GUI Li has been in Tianyin temple for many days, listening to the bell in the morning and the drum in the evening. He rings from the unknown place in the temple every day on time to live in silence. I don&rsquo;t know why, after only a few days, he seems to have been integrated into this strange environment. He is silent every day, just in a trance.</p>
<p>He is now in his prime, and his health is excellent. Although he is seriously injured, he is young, and his practice is high. In addition, Tianyin temple is so generous to him that he can use any good medicine. With the reputation of Tianyin temple, the good medicine in the temple is also the first-class good medicine in the world. The efficacy of the medicine is rapid, and his injuries are all good.</p>
<p>However, for a few days, he had been able to get out of bed and walk reluctantly. However, when he walked, he still had a sharp pain in his chest. However, Rao was so, and he also made FA Xiang and others who came to visit him happy. He said that he had never seen a person recover so quickly in the past. It seems that he can recover completely in less than a month.</p>
<p>In ordinary days, GUI Li gets along with them and talks with them occasionally. Both sides avoid talking about their opposite identities. It seems that in the eyes of the Buddhist monks in Faxiang Tianyin temple, GUI Li is just an ordinary person who they treat with good intentions, rather than the evil cult demon who they forcibly snatched from Qingyun gate in spite of the world&rsquo;s disrespect. And GUI Li no longer asked why people in Tianyin Temple wanted to save him.</p>
<p>As time passed by, his body got better day by day. These days, he was able to walk more easily. Sometimes when the morning bell and evening drum sounded, he would pull a chair to open the window, sit by the window, and listen attentively, as if the bell and drum in Tianyin temple were ringing for him. There is another charm.</p>
<p>During his healing period, only FA Xiang and FA Shan often came to visit him in Tianyin temple. Almost all the other monks did not come, let alone master Puhong and other monks of Pu generation. And because of the injury. GUI Li has never been out of this room. Apart from occasionally opening the window and looking out, what he saw in front of him was just a small courtyard with red walls and blue tiles, and a few short trees planted in the courtyard.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just for the ghost.</p>
<p>Such an ordinary and simple small yard had a familiar feeling that he had not seen for a long time. Although he did not reveal it from the day he opened the window, he immediately fell in love with this place in his heart.</p>
<p>Listening to the morning bell in the morning and listening to the evening drum in the evening, such a quiet and leisurely time, however, has made him unable to give up. Intoxicated.</p>
<p>Who knows, in his heart, once the biggest extravagant hope, but is to live such a peaceful life</p>
<p>Xumishan, Tianyin temple, the vast and magnificent temples, temples and pavilions, that strange and remote corner of the small courtyard, so live, live, live</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cheep!&rdquo; The wooden door was pushed open. FA Xiang came in alone, glanced at the room, and then fell on GUI Li, who was lying on the bed. He closed his eyes and didn&rsquo;t know if he was asleep.</p>
<p>FA Xiang smiles. He turned around and closed the door and said, &ldquo;how do you feel today? Is your chest still painful?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost Li body moved, slowly opened his eyes, looked at the Dharma one eye, and said faintly: &ldquo;you should ask this sentence every time you come. Don&rsquo;t you feel bored? &quot;</p>
<p>FA Xiang smiles and shakes his head. His eyes turn, but he goes to the other side of the wall. In front of the picture of the statue of Avalokitesvara, he takes three sticks of sandalwood from the altar table, lights them on a candle beside it, and then inserts them into the copper incense burner.</p>
<p>The smoke curled up and drifted into the air. The statue of Guanyin suddenly became a little hazy, and the air began to smell of sandalwood.</p>
<p>Dharma Xianghe paid three obeisances to the image of Guanyin. Then he turned around and looked at the ghost for a long time. Suddenly he said, &ldquo;are you just here to worship?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was stunned for a moment, and could not help but look at the portrait. In the picture, the grand master Guanyin has a compassionate, dignified and beautiful face. A pair of long and thin eyes, he seems to be looking at all the mortals in the world. At this moment, he is looking at himself as if he were merciful.</p>
<p>His heart moved, but then he sneered: &ldquo;I worship her very much. If she really has a spirit, I don&rsquo;t know how many times in the past I have sought God and the gods and Buddhas, and I have not seen them show mercy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>FA Xiang looked at him for a long time. He looked at him calmly and fiercely. He still sneered at him and did not show any regret. After a long time, FA Xiangchang sighed and turned around. He bowed his head to the statue of Avalokitesvara and said something softly in his mouth.</p>
<p>Ghouli looked at his appearance behind him and sneered.</p>
<p>After the ceremony, the Dharma minister turned around, and the compassion on his face gradually faded. He put on a peaceful smile and said, &ldquo;I think you look good today, and your body has generally recovered recently. Why don&rsquo;t we go out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>On hearing this, he was stunned and said, &ldquo;go out, where are you going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>FA Xiang said with a smile, &ldquo;go where you want to go and meet the people you want to see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost frowned, then raised his eyebrow and said, &ldquo;why, is it master Pu Hong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Dharma minister nodded his head and said, &ldquo;yes, master, I&rsquo;m very glad to hear that your body is recovering. Let me come and have a look today. If you are not tired, you can meet. I don&rsquo;t know what you think? &quot;</p>
<p>He glared at the Dharma for a long time, and then said with a smile: &ldquo;OK, OK, OK, I have been waiting for this day for a long time. Naturally, I want to see him. Not to mention that I am well, I will climb to see him if he wants to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dharma is consistent with the ten ways: &ldquo;benefactor, please follow me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, he led the way, went to the door first, opened the door and went out.</p>
<p>However, when he was about to walk out of the room, he suddenly looked back at the picture of the statue of Guanyin hanging on the wall. In the light smoke, he was kind and smiling, and seemed to be staring at him.</p>
<p>The ghost frowned and snorted, but he turned around immediately, never looking back, and went straight away. Only the thin sandalwood was floating in the empty room behind him.</p>
<p>Walk out of the courtyard. It is a passage about two feet long, four feet wide, with red walls on both sides, and more than two people tall. The top is covered with green glazed tiles. At the end of the passage is a circular arch. When you approach that arch, you can hear a sound coming from outside.</p>
<p>The voice was rather strange. At first glance, it seemed to be the voice of monks in the temple chanting the Scriptures. But there are also other strange sounds, some of which should not appear here in the ghostly imagination. For example, village women get together to chat and talk, or the believers pay homage to the Buddha in high voice, and some children cry.</p>
<p>How can these strange sounds appear in the Tianyin temple, which is known as one of the three great sects of the right way in the world?</p>
<p>He looked at FA Xiang, but he saw that FA Xiang&rsquo;s face did not change. He led the way in front of him and went out towards the arch. He frowned grimly. Calmed down, he went out.</p>
<p>Outside the door, you can see the white jade as the stone, the terrace as the field, and the stone steps, nine in a group, connecting to the Daxiong hall, which is as high as 9981 groups. Between the jade and stone railings, you can see that the palace is very tall. In front of the hall, 13 huge stone pillars rose from the sky, more than 10 Zhang high. The golden walls on the top of the hall are brilliant, and the eight ridges are equally distributed on it. Before each ridge and cornice dragon head, ten auspicious auspicious beasts are carved in different shapes and lifelike.</p>
<p>His Highness&rsquo;s various carvings are gorgeous and exquisite, which is far beyond the imagination of the world. It can be made by people who are not waiting. Behind the Mahavira hall, on both sides and in front of it, there are high-rise halls connected with one another. In the meantime, either the square is connected, or the path is winding. Some of them are directly connected, and they are stacked in layers, which is very spectacular.</p>
<p>Although the building is magnificent and magnificent, it is really amazing. But at this moment, the most astonishing thing is not these things, but on the solemn Holy Land of Buddhism, there are countless mortals shuttling around, countless people holding incense, kneeling to worship Buddha, steps square, inside and outside the hall, which is unimaginable.</p>
<p>A huge Tianyin temple, which has a high status in the world&rsquo;s right way, is like an ordinary temple in the world. It is open to countless secular people to burn incense and worship Buddha.</p>
<p>GUI Li never thought of this. He understood the strange sounds just now, but he was more confused about all the things in front of him. Growing up on Qingyun Mountain, he has long been used to the so-called fairy family style. The fairyland of Xianshan mountain was originally owned by only a Taoist. In Qingyun Mountain, where has ever seen a common people go up the mountain to burn incense and pray for wishes?</p>
<p>He turned his head and looked at him. He was surprised and asked, &ldquo;this&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a smile, he said, &ldquo;today is the first day of junior high school, so there are more people. Although there are hundreds of people who come to visit the temple on the 15th day, there is no such custom.</p>
<p>&quot;</p>
<p>GUI Li shook his head, hesitated for a moment, and finally asked, &ldquo;no, I wonder. How can you let the people come in to burn incense and worship Buddha?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seemed to be expected that FA relative GUI Li would ask this question. He nodded his head, made a posture of walking this way, and then walked to the back of the hall of Mahavira, walking along the way: &ldquo;in fact, Tianyin temple was not open to the secular world, just like the gate of Qingyun, but after my master Pu Hong took over the position of abbot, he and three other martial uncles learned Buddhism and made great wishes &ldquo;Buddha is the Buddha of all living beings, not one of us. So he decided to open the mountain gate to accept the people. &quot;</p>
<p>At this point, the Dharma minister stopped and pointed to the countless steps leading to the Mahavira hall and said, &ldquo;do you see that long stone step?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He nodded his head and said, &ldquo;how?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Dharma is consistent with the ten principles: &ldquo;that was when a martial uncle saw that the mountain road was steep. Although the people were willing to worship Buddha, there were many weak people who could not move on the mountain, so they could not go up the mountain to fulfill their wishes. With great magic power, with the power of one person, it took ten years of hard work to carve out this smooth path of Buddha sea on the originally steep mountain road, and did such boundless good deeds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li couldn&rsquo;t help but be awed, and his face began to rise again. He said, &ldquo;there is such a great master. May I ask his name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>FA Xiang looked at him, and after an unexpected silence for a moment, he whispered, &ldquo;that martial uncle, whose name is Puzhi, has been dead for more than ten years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His fierce and stiff body was like the word &ldquo;Puzhi&rdquo;, which was like thunder on a sunny day. Shengsheng hit him in his mind, shaking his mind to pieces.</p>
<p>FA Xiang looked at the ghost and saw that it was changeable and changeable. He sighed and said in a low voice: &ldquo;well, let&rsquo;s go. The abbot is still waiting for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He walked with FA Xiang, but he was relaxed. Now it has become very heavy. After walking for several Zhangs, he suddenly turned back and saw the crowd in the distance, countless people walking on the stone steps. The old man, the man, the woman, the child, one by one, walked on the stone steps with reverent faces, chanting the name of Buddha in their mouths, as if they had gone this way, they were closer to the Buddha.</p>
<p>The expression on his face is complex and hard to understand. After a long time, he turned his head slowly and walked forward. The Dharma that is waiting in front of him is ten chanting Buddhas, but he doesn&rsquo;t say much.</p>
<p>They went together, leaving behind the countless believers and the silent Buddhist Road, and left them in the world.</p>
<p>This place was originally the human world, and it is no longer the realm of immortal Buddhism.</p>
<p>After passing the Mahavira hall, there is still a long string of temples. After all, Tianyin temple is a famous school, which can be compared with other temples. However, FA Xiang walked backward with the ghost and Li all the way, but did not stop at any of the temples and pavilions, just walked back to the mountain.</p>
<p>All the way, GUI Li just followed FA Xiang without saying a word. His face was full of thoughts. He turned a blind eye to the beautiful buildings around him.</p>
<p>But in the end, FA Xiang took him out of the back door of Tianyin temple and walked up a small mountain road to the top of Xumi mountain. GUI Li frowned and said, &ldquo;why, master Pu Hong is not in the temple?&rdquo;</p>
<p>FA Xiang nodded and said, &ldquo;yes. Although the temple is open to the secular world, it&rsquo;s an act of boundless merit. After all, the nuns need to be clean. The master and several martial uncles are quiet people. They always live in the small temple on the top of the mountain. We usually call it &ldquo;xiaotianyin temple.&rdquo; Say it. He smiles, revealing two white teeth.</p>
<p>GUI Li nodded in silence and did not say anything more. He followed FA Xiang to the top of Xumi mountain.</p>
<p>Although Xumi mountain is not as high as Qingyun gate Tongtian peak, it is definitely not low. The Tianyin temple they just came out of was in the middle of the mountain, but they went up this time and walked for half an hour before they saw the plaque of the small Tianyin temple.</p>
<p>From the outside, the small Tianyin temple is indeed a small word. The courtyard that can&rsquo;t enter or exit three times is far from the magnificent Tianyin temple on the middle of the mountain. However, it is far away from the secular world. You can see the green pines and bamboos around the temple. The wind blows through the mountains and the bamboo shakes. It&rsquo;s indescribable and elegant. Compared with the bustle at the foot of the mountain, it&rsquo;s a different taste.</p>
<p>After walking these many roads, I could see the sweat on my forehead. Now I have a rest for a while. Looking back, I can see that the incense is flourishing in Tianyin temple in the middle of the mountain. I can see it clearly from afar. There is a voice of human voice and an indescribable meaning of piety and solemnity.</p>
<p>After a long time, he turned around, FA Xiang nodded and took him into the small Tianyin temple.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s much simpler here than at the foot of the mountain. They pass through the middle Buddha Hall, turn two turns to the right, and enter the back hall. There are three pure Zen rooms.</p>
<p>FA Xiang went up to the door of the Buddhist temple in the middle and said in a loud voice, &ldquo;master, benefactor Zhang Xiaofan has come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An old but kind voice rang out in the meditation room, saying, &ldquo;please come in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>FA Xiang turned back and made a gesture of invitation to Gui Li. After hesitating for a moment, he walked into the room. However, he stopped outside and didn&rsquo;t seem to mean to go in together.</p>
<p>Walking into chastity, as like as two peas, the spirit of the Buddhist temple was almost the same as the one in the Buddhist temple. But now the world is full of righteousness. Master Pu Hong, the abbot of Tianyin temple, is sitting on his Zen bed, holding a string of beads in his hand and looking at him with a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here you are.&rdquo; Master Pu Hong&rsquo;s voice was peaceful and said with a smile.</p>
<p>Somehow, faced with this holy monk, GUI Li&rsquo;s mind was a little turbulent. He soon calmed down and took a deep breath. He nodded and said, &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong looked at him carefully from top to bottom. His eyes twinkled with compassion and light, and the rosary beads in his hand also turned gently. After a while, he said, &ldquo;you should ask me something?&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li immediately nodded his head and said, &ldquo;yes, I&rsquo;m very surprised. Why did Tianyin Temple take the risk of falling out with Qingyun gate to save me? And why do you&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He asked in a hurry. His voice was very fast, but only half of the time he asked, he stopped involuntarily. Master Pu Hong stretched out his right hand and stopped in mid air, blocking him from going on.</p>
<p>He looked at master Puhong with bewilderment. Master Puhong bowed his head and praised the Buddha&rsquo;s name. However, he got out of the meditation bed, stood up and said to the ghost: &ldquo;before you ask me, I&rsquo;ll take you to see someone first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is that?&rdquo; he said</p>
<p>Pu Hong did not answer, but went to the layman and said slowly, &ldquo;this man has wanted to see you for a long time, and I know that you must also want to see him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was shocked, but subconsciously followed up. Somehow, his palms were sweating, and his heart beat suddenly. It seemed that there was something in front of him that made him fear.</p>
<p>FA Xiang had been standing quietly outside the meditation room. He saw master Pu Hong come out so quickly. His face did not change. He only stepped back and stood aside. Master Pu Hong looked at him, nodded, and without saying anything, he went to the other direction with a fierce spirit. It was the last courtyard in the courtyard, which was close to a mountain wall.</p>
<p>Note 1: the carving of auspicious animals on the cornice of a temple is a unique architectural regulation in ancient China. There are extremely detailed rules for the division of the number. From the emperor to the official to the ordinary family, there are detailed regulations, which can not be overstepped. Otherwise, it would be disrespectful to punish a crime and kill the family. There are ten auspicious animals on the roof of the building. Since ancient times, there is only one building in China, which is the Taihe Hall of the Forbidden City, which is the only one in the world. This is a fiction. Readers will laugh at it.</p>
<p>Note 2: burning incense and worshipping Buddha is very popular in China, where Buddhism is widely spread. It is also called the ceremony or the Buddhist Association. This is mostly the case from the Yonghe temple in Beijing to the small temples in Rural Fujian in the south. When I was young, I watched my grandmother burn incense and grow up, and I still do so. When I started writing, I could not help but sigh when I read about it. (to be continued. )</p>
