      <p>The setting sun, hanging far from the horizon, spreads the residual warmth to the land of Southern Xinjiang behind the tall, steep and rolling mountains. The yellow light fell on the silent earth, and the wild was desolate.</p>
<p>Leaving the ghostly and Golden Vase of the burning incense Valley, standing on the wasteland in front of 100000 mountains, facing the endless towering mountains and vast land, they seem to be just two insignificant little creatures, looking up at the huge existence between heaven and earth, looking at the setting sun on that day, little by little, falling behind the boundless mountains, and the sky was slowly darkening.</p>
<p>Talking and breathing, stars in the flow, who can win the time?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s GUI Li&rsquo;s proposal to leave the burning incense valley. It&rsquo;s just that on that day, I overheard the dialogue between Yun Yilan and other three people in the burning incense valley. It&rsquo;s known that there may be different methods in the burning incense Valley, which may wake up the &ldquo;eight evil XuanHuo array&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s a great opportunity. With the original purpose of GUI Li and Jin pinger, they should continue to hide and observe carefully. However, GUI Li did not know how to leave the burning incense Valley in his indifferent face. However, jinpinger, who has always been extremely intelligent, did not seem to have thought of this layer. Instead, he readily agreed.</p>
<p>After leaving the burning incense Valley, GUI Li and Jin Ping&rsquo;er seldom talk about each other or discuss how to trace them. However, they seem to have some tacit understanding. They all come to the south by chance. Until today, they come to the legendary place of terror, &ldquo;100000 mountains&rdquo;. Under the Black Mountain of Canyang, in the Xiaoxiao wilderness, they gaze at the mountains in silence.</p>
<p>The wind in the wilderness has no fragrance of flowers and plants, but the faint smell and roar of unknown places in the distance. In this place, even the wind beside the body seems fierce.</p>
<p>The golden vase&rsquo;er&rsquo;s hair swayed gently in the wind and raised her head slightly, revealing her smooth and delicate chin and a white neck, overlooking the distant mountains. The high black mountain is covered with thick gray fog. Constantly rolling, behind these mountains, what kind of world is it?</p>
<p>Others may be guessing, but in the hazy and complicated eyes of the Golden Vase. But as if something was shining.</p>
<p>Different from the quiet and charming woman beside her, although she didn&rsquo;t speak much, what she thought in her heart was just like a storm. The ups and downs are huge.</p>
<p>First of all, the matter of blood sacrifice touched him greatly. Although he had killed a lot of himself over the years, and even won the title of &ldquo;Blood Prince&rdquo; in the demon cult, he was subconsciously repelled and disgusted by what he heard in the burning incense valley a few days ago, as if he had been deeply rooted in his heart. And then, he suddenly awakened from a casual reminder from the Golden Vase to what he had been neglecting in the past: the evil cult. Even the ghost king may be doing something similar to that of incense burning valley</p>
<p>Taking the blood of countless living people and sacrificing them to gods, needless to say, this God belongs to the evil god and the evil god. However, the blood sacrifice itself is a matter of great harm to the harmony of heaven and inhumanity, but these things happen at his own side.</p>
<p>What kind of a world is this?</p>
<p>Is it that everyone in this world is crazy?</p>
<p>Or after all, it was the enchanting and strange youth who once met that said: people, after all, are just a kind of animals, and there is no difference.</p>
<p>A deep breath. Silently looking to the distant mountains. After hearing the order delivered to him by the ghost king from Mr. GUI, GUI Li had already guessed from the evil beast &ldquo;Taotie&rdquo; in the order that the strange boy who had two sides of fate was the animal God who caused unprecedented calamity to the world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just. The beast God wanted to kill all the people in the world, but why did he give him a leniency? He just broke up by talking and laughing twice, but what the ghost didn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Chest, there is a faint warmth, how many years. This faint warmth has been accompanied by the ghost, as if it has been a part of his body, and even most of the time, the ghost has ignored the warmth. However, the trip to the burning incense valley a few days ago touched a place in his heart. The jade formula lying quietly on his chest may be the key to this trip to southern Xinjiang!</p>
<p>From the dialogue between Yun Yilan and shangguance, it is clearly explained that it is precisely because of the loss of the essence of ten thousand fire that the burning incense Valley can no longer start the eight evil XuanHuo array after losing the volcanic aura accumulated for hundreds of years. If you have this XuanHuo Jian, can you find the secret of the mysterious array?</p>
<p>The ghost is silent, looking at the setting sun in the distance, the last bit of light, finally disappeared quietly.</p>
<p>At the top of the black mountain, as the last ray of sunshine dissipated, the once strong black fog suddenly seemed to be stimulated by something and began to dissipate and thin rapidly.</p>
<p>Standing on one side of the gold bottle son smile, turned around and said: &ldquo;OK, let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How did you ever see a change in the fog</p>
<p>The Golden Vase son smiles with a smile in her eyes, which is charming and infinite. It seems to tease and quibble. She says, &ldquo;well, I just don&rsquo;t tell you. What can you do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman in front of her suddenly seems to be emitting a beautiful and charming light in the dark world, dazzling. With her presence, it is unexpected and has another strange warmth.</p>
<p>At least, there&rsquo;s no need to walk alone in the dark.</p>
<p>The corners of his mouth moved, but he turned his head and said faintly, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that, when he went first, the Golden Vase behind him looked at his figure, smiling and twinkling, and followed him gently.</p>
<p>Two figures, one before and one after the other, and the monkey lying on his shoulder, the squeak from time to time, slowly melted into the darkness and disappeared.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Qingyun Mountain, Tongtian peak, Yuqing hall.</p>
<p>Thousands of miles away from southern Xinjiang, this holy land of immortal family has just saved the world. The chaos caused by the beast demon catastrophe was quickly and properly disposed of as after the war between the right and the devil ten years ago. Most parts of Tongtian peak have restored the original quiet and ethereal scenery. Except for a few buildings with huge damage, they need to be renovated slowly, but no one doubts it We will quickly return to the original appearance.</p>
<p>Among all the huge buildings on Tongtian peak, the most important and the largest is naturally the main hall &ldquo;Yuqing hall&rdquo;. Compared with other buildings, the damage of Yuqing hall in that disaster can be ignored. It seems that the ancestors of Qingyun gate have spirit and good protection.</p>
<p>And at this moment, just as GUI Li and Jin Ping&rsquo;er are about to enter the mysterious and strange mountains to trace the defeated and escaped beast gods. In the sacred Yuqing hall on the Tongtian peak of Qingyun Mountain, a quarrel broke out.</p>
<p>In addition to changmen Tongtian peak, Qingyun gate is the first of six vessels. After the monster disaster, it is rare to gather in Yuqing hall again, but the most important. But they came here, not by the call of daoxuan, the real master of Taoism, but by themselves. On the main hall, it was not daoxuan, but Xiao Yicai, who was slightly embarrassed.</p>
<p>Qi Hao, the leader of dragon head peak and Chu Yuhong, head of Chaoyang peak, are the second generation of disciples in terms of seniority. They are of the same generation with Xiao Yicai. Naturally, they are not as direct as the other four martial uncles. Most of the time, they were silent. But the other four veins: dazhufeng, xiaozhufeng, fenghuifeng and luoxiafeng are not so polite.</p>
<p>Tian Buyi, the first seat of dazhufeng, has the biggest voice among the four. He is sitting on a red sandalwood chair and coldly says to Xiao Yicai: &ldquo;nephew Xiao, six of us have come here for two hours now. How can the leader&rsquo;s elder brother not come out to meet us? In his eyes, we are old enough to be in such a situation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai&rsquo;s face was extremely embarrassed. With a wry smile on his face, he said with a smile, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s your language? Uncle Tian, you&rsquo;ve always been highly respected in our Qingyun gate. As we all know, the master always valued you</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi didn&rsquo;t wait for him to finish. He snorted and said with a sneer: &ldquo;so the headmaster and elder martial brother valued me so much that he didn&rsquo;t care about me for two hours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai smothered and said with a bitter smile, &ldquo;Uncle Tian. As the disciple has said just now, the master really entered the magic moon cave ten days ago and was closed. Now the affairs on Tongtian peak are under the charge of the disciple. &quot;</p>
<p>The four elders sitting at the head of the table snorted coldly at the same time. They obviously didn&rsquo;t believe Xiao Yicai&rsquo;s words. Master Shuiyue of xiaozhufeng, who was sitting on the side, said coldly: &ldquo;nephew Xiao, although I have been in xiaozhufeng for ten days, I have heard that the leader&rsquo;s elder martial brother is acting strangely on Tongtian peak. What&rsquo;s more, one night a few days ago, someone even heard that the headmaster was crazy and roared at the top of Yuqing hall. Is that true</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai immediately shook his head and said, &ldquo;there is absolutely no such thing. Martial uncle Shuiyue must have heard it wrong. Master, he is a master of Tao. He is the leader of the world&rsquo;s righteousness. How can he do such a crazy thing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The four elders looked at each other and saw that others doubted Xiao Yicai&rsquo;s words.</p>
<p>Sitting next to fenghuifeng&rsquo;s head seat, TIANRI Taoist priest takes over as the head of Luoxia peak. He looks pure and emaciated. He wears a Taoist robe and frowns and says, &ldquo;nephew Xiao, it&rsquo;s not our martial uncles who are in trouble. You, nephew, are really the headmaster and elder martial brother. He is the center of our Qingyun sect. If something happens to him, he is afraid to shake my Qingyun foundation. That&rsquo;s what we are Be sure to come up and ask you, but don&rsquo;t take it to heart. &quot;</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai&rsquo;s status was lower than that of several martial uncles, so he had to stand aside and smile bitterly at the moment, saying: &ldquo;martial uncles, I dare not remember hate in my heart, but, master, he is indeed closed and ordered not to disturb Feiyicai deliberately obstructs you from seeing your master. &quot;</p>
<p>Tian Bu was not easy to get angry. He snorted and said, &ldquo;stop talking nonsense. These days, the whole Qingyun sect has been spread all over the world. The leader&rsquo;s behavior is extremely strange. Sometimes he is crazy and sometimes at a loss when he is on the Tongtian peak. If the leader&rsquo;s elder martial brother is in a bad health, we should try our best to cure the disease for him, at least visit him. If he is safe, we should visit him How can you refuse to come out to see us. &quot; Speaking of this, he suddenly raised his voice and said angrily, &ldquo;Xiao Yicai, to be honest, what&rsquo;s the matter with the headmaster and senior brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai&rsquo;s body was shocked. He seemed to be startled by Tian Bu Yi&rsquo;s loud voice. However, his face was still slightly wry and silent.</p>
<p>Uncle Zeng, the first seat of fenghuifeng, who had been sitting beside him and didn&rsquo;t speak much, looked at Xiao Yicai, frowned tightly, pondered for a moment, and then said, &ldquo;well, nephew Xiao, we old men also know that you always respect master and dare not disobey him. We don&rsquo;t embarrass you. Now, as long as you take us to the place where the headmaster and elder martial brother are closed, we will greet him by ourselves. What do you think? &quot;</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai was stunned for a moment and did not speak. However, his face showed a look of thinking. Zeng Shuchang looked back and looked at the people behind him. Tian Buyi and master Shuiyue nodded slowly. Zeng Shuchang coughed and stood up slowly. In a calm voice, he said: &ldquo;nephew Xiao, in fact, we only care about the leader and elder martial brother. We all have great respect for the elder martial brother and his old man. Everyone in Qingyun clan knows this. As long as we see the leader and know that he is in good health, we will be relieved.</p>
<p>By the way, it&rsquo;s said that the leader&rsquo;s elder martial brother has closed down recently, according to the old system of Qingyun gate. There are no more than three places in Yuqing hall, ancestral hall and magic moon cave, but they don&rsquo;t know him. &quot;</p>
<p>At the end of his speech, Zeng Shuchang&rsquo;s voice slowly slowed down, but his eyes turned to Xiao Yicai. Xiao Yicai&rsquo;s face changed a few times. After a long time, he bowed his head to all of Zeng Shuchang and said, &ldquo;master, because Qingyun has suffered many changes in recent years, he often blames himself, and often worships his ancestors in the ancestral temple.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shuchang frowned. He nodded and said nothing more. He went to the back hall of Yuqing hall first. Tian Buyi, master Shuiyue and TIANRI Taoist followed him. Qi Hao and Chu Yuhong slowly stand up and walk past Xiao Yicai. Qi Hao smiles bitterly on his face and pats Xiao Yicai on the shoulder. Xiao Yicai sighs and shakes his head.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>The ancestral hall at the back of Qingyun Mountain. It is still hidden in the deep woods, only in the gap between the green leaves and trees, revealing a little cornice. Maybe it&rsquo;s the protection of the ancestors of Qingyun gate. The two shocking catastrophes in the past ten years have not been damaged here.</p>
<p>As in the past, from a distance, the dim ancestral hall has a faint flicker of incense, giving people an unfathomable feeling.</p>
<p>A group of people soon walked from the Yuqing hall to the back mountain and came to the Trident intersection in front of the ancestral hall. All of a sudden, Qi Hao, who was walking later, let out a sound of &ldquo;Yi&rdquo;, which was somewhat surprised. He took a few steps to step forward. People followed his eyes and saw that there was a young man standing quietly in front of the ancestral hall which was gradually revealed. However, his eyes were looking into the deep of the ancestral hall and his back was facing Qi Hao&rsquo;s people.</p>
<p>Qi Hao frowned and exclaimed, &ldquo;is it younger martial brother Lin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as the young man&rsquo;s figure shook, he turned around and saw Lin Jingyu.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu suddenly saw Qi Hao, and his face was also a flash of joy. But then he saw that Qi Hao was followed by many people, all of whom were the heads of the Qingyun gate. He could not help but be shocked and surprised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elder martial brother Qi, why are you here? Why are you all here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Qi Hao approached Lin Jingyu and said with a smile: &ldquo;I came all the way just now. I was wondering if I could meet you here. Our brothers haven&rsquo;t seen each other for many days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu was obviously very happy to see Qi Hao. Zhan Yan said with a smile: &ldquo;yes, I miss my senior brother very much.</p>
<p>By the way, &ldquo;he looked at the others and asked Qi Hao in a low voice,&rdquo; elder martial brother, why are you here with these first martial uncles and brothers? &quot;</p>
<p>Qi Hao took a look at the ancestral hall behind Lin Jingyu, frowned and said, &ldquo;younger martial brother Lin, well, Master Zhang, can he be in this ancestral hall?&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t know why, when Qi Hao talks, he doesn&rsquo;t deliberately lower his voice. Instead, he seems to let everyone behind him hear him.</p>
<p>The smile on Lin Jingyu&rsquo;s face also slowly disappeared. Obviously, he also found that things were a little different. However, in the face of all the respected senior brothers and uncles, he still honestly said: &ldquo;the real master is in the ancestral hall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a slight commotion behind Qi Hao, which soon calmed down again. Then, uncle Zeng said in a bland voice: &ldquo;what&rsquo;s he doing inside? Shut up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu seemed to be scared and said, &ldquo;shut up, close what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as Qi Hao&rsquo;s face changed, Tian Bu Yi took a step forward, but was stopped by Zeng Shuchang. Zeng Shuchang made a color to Tian Bu Yi, shook his head, and then looked at Qi Hao. Qi Hao understood, frowned and asked Lin Jingyu, &ldquo;younger martial brother Lin, have you been on Tongtian peak recently?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu nodded and said, &ldquo;not bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Qi Hao pondered for a moment, as if he was weighing his words. Then he said slowly, &ldquo;have you seen or heard anything strange on this Tongtian peak?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu thought for a moment. He glanced over the faces of all the people present, and his eyes gradually brightened up, but his face did not change much. He still replied honestly: &ldquo;report back to senior brother. Although I have been on the Tongtian peak all the time, I have been in the ancestral hall to mourn for my predecessors, so I haven&rsquo;t heard of anything outside. &quot; He had a pause. Looking at Qi Hao, he said, &ldquo;elder martial brother, what happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Qi Hao smothered and shook his head with a bitter smile. &ldquo;No, nothing happened. By the way, how can you stand here in broad daylight? Aren&rsquo;t you going to keep the spirit in the ancestral temple? &quot;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu took a look at the dark depths of the ancestral hall and said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the real master who asked me to stand here. Every time he comes. Let me stand outside by myself, and then he entered the ancestral hall alone</p>
<p>As soon as this was said, Zeng Shuchang and others all changed their color slightly. Qi Hao frowned and said, &ldquo;is the master still in it now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu nodded: &ldquo;yes, he is in the ancestral hall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Qi Hao nodded, stepped back a few steps and stopped speaking.</p>
<p>Zeng Shuchang, Tian Buyi and others looked at each other, but there was no action for a moment, and a moment later. Tian Bu Yi snorted and strode out to the door of the ancestral hall, but did not step up the steps. Under the stone steps, he said in a loud voice: &ldquo;elder martial brother daoxuan, I&rsquo;m Tian Buyi. The others are Shuiyue, TIANRI, Zeng Shuchang and the first nephew of the other two veins. I&rsquo;ve come to see you. Are you here? &quot;</p>
<p>His voice was loud and clear, full of air, and immediately spread in the forest. Vaguely looking, it seems that the dark place in the ancestral hall, even the little incense suddenly lit up, then slowly returned to normal.</p>
<p>A moment later, a voice came out of the darkness and said coldly, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Buyi and the other elders were shocked. The voice was very cold, and there was a bit of anger. There was no trace of Taoist immortal&rsquo;s pure and upright flavor. However, they were all figures who had known him for more than hundreds of years. As soon as the words came into their ears, they recognized them. It was really the voice of immortal daoxuan.</p>
<p>What happened to the Taoist immortal who once ruled the world&rsquo;s right way?</p>
<p>With this in mind, Tian Buyi and others have changed their faces.</p>
<p>Tian Buyi coughed, took a deep breath, and said in a loud voice again: &ldquo;elder martial brother, we heard that you are in a bad condition recently, so we came here to visit you specially. Please allow us to come in and see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan&rsquo;s voice was silent for a moment. When it reappeared, it was accompanied by a sneer, with a chilling chill: &ldquo;see me? Do you think I need the leader of six veins to come together? I think you are trying to force the palace, so you can have a look at my position as a real person in charge of teaching! &quot;</p>
<p>As soon as this statement was uttered, it was like thunder from nowhere. It shocked everyone to change color. It was not easy for the field to change color. It was also involuntarily retreating a few steps. With a look of astonishment and surprise, he turned his head and saw that even Shuiyue, who had always been calm and indifferent in the past, had an unbelievable expression on their faces.</p>
<p>Zeng Shuchang&rsquo;s eyes were full of worry. Taking a step forward, he said in a loud voice: &ldquo;headmaster, elder martial brother, where do you say this? We, younger martial brothers and sisters, have never had this idea for hundreds of years. We have not, now, and will not have it.</p>
<p>Recently, we came here just to care about the health of the elder martial brother. It seems that I have no two minds. You must not be wrong. &quot;</p>
<p>Taoist priest&rsquo;s voice suddenly raised and sneered: &ldquo;Zeng Shuchang, among the six vessels, you always have the deepest mind. On that day, you had been aware of the plot of Cangsong on Longshou peak, but you kept silent all the time. Do you think I don&rsquo;t know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shuchang&rsquo;s face changed greatly. Tian Buyi, master Shuiyue and TIANRI Taoist also turned around in astonishment and looked at Zeng Shuchang.</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue stared at Zeng Shuchang and said for a long time, &ldquo;is this really true?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shuchang made a wry smile and shook his head and said, &ldquo;where can we start from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue is still waiting to be questioned. Suddenly, there are countless dim incense lights in the ancestral hall without wind. You can&rsquo;t see clearly in the dark. But somehow, it makes people feel that there is something strange roaring in the dark.</p>
<p>Almost at the same time, the voice of the real man daoxuan came again, but the object he was referring to was transferred from Zeng Shuchang to master Shuiyue: &ldquo;Shuiyue, what are you pretending to be? Do you think you are really dignified when you look high?&rdquo; He had a strange voice, a bit shrill, mixed with a bit hoarse, and said, &ldquo;when Wan Jian fell into the ancestral hall, he swept the floor and died. Finally, he died by the hands of evil and evil. It&rsquo;s all up to you, all thanks to you! Ha ha ha ha ha &quot;</p>
<p>At the end of the day, daoxuan&rsquo;s voice seemed to be uncontrollable, laughing wildly. However, at this moment, no one paid attention to him any more. Tian Buyi, Zeng Shuchang and other people all lost their color. They looked at the pale water moon and couldn&rsquo;t speak for a long time.</p>
<p>Qi Hao and other disciples of later generations only watched and listened to the stupor, while master Shuiyue was shaking. But somehow, her eyes were full of burning, almost fanatical eyes that had never been seen before. She took a few steps, as if she did not care about anything else, and called out to the ancestral Hall: &ldquo;what are you talking about? Is it true that senior brother Wan is still alive</p>
<p>A word to wake up people, Tian Bu Yi and so on almost at the same time, one by one excited, followed by the ancestral hall asked.</p>
<p>However, the arrogant laughter of daoxuan immortal was more and more crazy, which reverberated over the ancestral hall of Qingyun Mountain for a long time. (to be continued. )</p>
