      <p>Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s desire to build a foundation was aroused by Xu Baocai&rsquo;s words. In the following days, he went to the Sutra Pavilion several times, and even to the Shenwu hall.</p>
<p>In the Shenwu hall, there are many common sense in the Xiuzhen area, and there are also more detailed descriptions about the foundation. When I saw that what was written in it was really similar to what Xu Baocai said, Bai Xiaochun suddenly burst into flames.</p>
<p>He felt that as long as he could build the foundation, he would take a big step in his long life.</p>
<p>Especially when he learned that there were three ways to build foundation, and the increase of longevity was different. With his constant research, he finally had a clear understanding of foundation construction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaven, earth and man, three kinds of foundation building&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humanitarianism builds foundation, need to take build foundation pill, the probability is not big, if can succeed, increase 100 years life yuan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The tunnel foundation is built with the Qi of the earth&rsquo;s veins. The chance of achieving amazing power is smaller. Once it is successful, it will increase 200 years of life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the end of the story It&rsquo;s extremely rare to build a foundation according to the law of heaven. However, once the foundation is built successfully, 500 years of life will be increased! &quot; Bai Xiaochun studied it carefully, and found that the foundation of the heavenly way was ethereal and could not be sought, while the foundation of the tunnel needed to be built in a specific place.</p>
<p>Then, the simplest thing in front of him is to build the foundation by humanity. This method needs to build the foundation pill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I have to plan for the future. I need to make full preparation and plan carefully. To build the foundation pill, we must have&hellip;&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun takes a deep breath and puts down the jade slips, showing the light in her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s expensive to build foundation pills, and I need to prepare more foundation pills just in case, so The best way, of course, is to refine it yourself There was a flash of light in Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s eyes. He was determined to become a great pharmacist refining the elixir of immortality. At the moment, he was more persistent in his ideal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Medicine boy, medicine apprentice, pharmacist I am now a medicine boy. If I want to become a drug apprentice and really refine pills, I need to be promoted and assessed The assessment needs to master at least five pieces of vegetation, but this is not safe. If I want to know all the five chapters of spirit and beast, it will be safe. &quot; Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s eyes showed firmness. He took out the jade slips in the third chapter of plants and trees. After carefully reading it, he was sure to remember them all and immediately got up and rushed out.</p>
<p>But soon he ran back, meditated in the yard for a moment, took out a lot of clothes, dressed himself up, and then let go quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those admirers of Zhou Xinqi are so terrible that they want to break me up I have to keep a low profile Bai Xiaochun is not angry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hum, when I build the foundation, we must pay attention to everyone and tell everyone that I am Bai Xiaochun, who dares to unload me at that time!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun measured the gap between those admirers of Zhou Xinqi and himself and vowed.</p>
<p>Wanyao pavilion has always been a sea of people. Not only the outer disciples of Xiangyun mountain are here, but also the disciples from Qingfeng mountain and ziding mountain who are eager for knowledge of vegetation.</p>
<p>At the moment, Bai Xiaochun gets into the crowd and walks into the wooden house under the third stone tablet of grass and trees. A moment later, he opens the door and walks quickly into the crowd.</p>
<p>If you want to leave immediately, you can&rsquo;t help but wait. Soon, the sound of exclamation comes out. Everyone here can see the design of a little turtle on the stone tablet in Chapter 3 of vegetation, riding on the vase.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun was complacent and could not help it. When the crowd exclaimed, she also put on a look of surprise and surprise, and then roared a few times. But soon those admirers of Zhou Xinqi appeared, one by one, and they were ferocious. Bai Xiaochun clenched his fist here.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s these people who make me so low-key.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun glared at those people angrily, turned and left quickly.</p>
<p>In the days after that, news about the reappearance of the little turtle spread all over the outer gate of Xiangyun mountain, and everyone talked about it. After all, the pattern of the Little Turtle was very conspicuous on the stone tablet this year.</p>
<p>But just one month later, the disciples of Wanyao Pavilion suddenly saw that on the fourth stone tablet, the little turtle appeared again, still riding on the vase, becoming the first.</p>
<p>There was an uproar!</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about to surpass elder martial sister Zhou Xinqi. This little turtle is already the first of the four steles!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is four steles, and sister Zhou Xinqi is five steles. Who is this little turtle&hellip;&rdquo; In the crowd, Bai Xiaochun screamed and felt comfortable. Seeing Zhou Xinqi&rsquo;s admirers go crazy, he coughed and hid with anger.</p>
<p>A few days later, Zhou Xinqi appeared in the Wanyao Pavilion and looked at the four stone tablets. She looked dignified and walked into the tenth stone tablet. When she came out, she occupied the first place in the tenth stone tablet.</p>
<p>At this time, all the disciples of Xiangyun mountain are paying attention to Wanyao Pavilion, including six tablets of Zhou Xinqi and four tablets of little tortoise</p>
<p>They are all wondering whether the little turtle will appear again next month, win the fifth monument, and keep pace with Zhou Xinqi.</p>
<p>Even these outside disciples began to bet on whether the little tortoise could be the first in the five steles. Even the elders of Xiangyun mountain paid attention to this.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun also made a fierce effort. Every time he got the first prize, he would study it day and night. In addition, he hated Zhou Xinqi&rsquo;s admirers. So every month after he went to Wanyao pavilion to win the first prize, he would scream in the crowd to express his worship for the little turtle.</p>
<p>Gradually, he got to know many people who adored the little turtle in the crowd. Of course, he also had his credit. He almost never missed any opportunity to promote the little turtle. For example, Hou Xiaomei had worshipped the little turtle to the extreme.</p>
<p>Finally, a month later, on a sunny day, the vase of the fifth stone tablet suddenly flashed, and one of them fell. On top of the vase, the little black appeared again.</p>
<p>At this moment, the outside disciples of Xiangyun mountain made a sensation, and countless people came to watch. Even in the days after that, most of what they talked about was the little turtle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This little tortoise must have reached an indescribable level of attainments in vegetation to be so amazing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fierce, this little tortoise is not as good as elder martial sister Zhou&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the crowd, it&rsquo;s not that no one guesses that the other party is Bai Xiaochun, and even those admirers of Zhou Xinqi. In a frenzy, all suspicious targets are not let go. Naturally, they also focus on Bai Xiaochun here.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun was even more resentful. In order to wash away the suspicion, he had to sigh and pretend to go to the fourth stone tablet in front of all the people. He was in a daze for a moment and vowed to let those people look good in the future, and then he walked out.</p>
<p>After many times, gradually those admirers will doubt the target of other people, after all, this kind of thing, there is no evidence, it is really difficult to find out the answer.</p>
<p>But ruthlessly, he released it several times, telling everyone that if he found the little turtle this time, it was not a matter of dumping eight pieces, but preparing to unload 80 pieces!</p>
<p>When Bai Xiaochun knew it, he thought about how he was unloaded into 80 yuan. He shivered for a moment, but he bit his teeth and got up again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you unhappy? The more unhappy you are, the more I want this first!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun clenched his teeth, separated from each other, and directly worked in this way.</p>
<p>A month later, the sixth stone tablet, little turtle first!</p>
<p>Another month, the seventh stone tablet, little turtle again first!</p>
<p>At the moment when the seven steles were all the first, the whole Wanyao Pavilion erupted with strong cheers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seven steles first, little tortoise come on, create a ten stele No. 1 that senior sister Zhou didn&rsquo;t reach!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha ha, I&rsquo;ll take good care of this little tortoise. He will make it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When these countless people cheered, there were more than a dozen young people around, their faces gloomy. Especially, there were several inner disciples, and their eyes were bleak. One of them had a lot of pockmarks on his face and wore the long clothes of the inner disciples. His eyes were most fierce.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brothers and sisters, if anyone knows who this little turtle is, tell Qian, and Qian promises a favor!&rdquo; The pockmarked young man suddenly opened his mouth, and his voice, with some kind of vibration, suddenly suppressed everyone.</p>
<p>Many people immediately looked at the pockmarked youth, recognized his identity, and quickly avoided their eyes. However, many others were angry, but they did not dare to speak more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Qian Dajin, the inner disciple who joined the law enforcement hall, senior brother Qian&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard that this man is pursuing elder martial sister Zhou and Du Lingfei&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun was also in the crowd, witnessing this behind the scenes, and with the people around her, she glared indignantly at the young man with a pockmarked face. When she came back to the yard, she was angry when she thought of each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t find me anyway. I will fight you!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun raised his chin and wrote five chapters about spirit animals. He was more persistent in his research. With the understanding of the materials that can be used to refine miraculous drugs in spirit animals, his attainments in plants and trees have improved a lot.</p>
<p>Especially after combining with each other, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s attainments in grass and trees have increased with each passing day.</p>
<p>A month later, the eighth stone tablet, the pattern of little tortoise instead of the vase, became the first!</p>
<p>Then another month, the ninth stone tablet, little turtle again first!</p>
<p>So far, the nine steles are the first!</p>
<p>This made all the disciples of Wanyao Pavilion boil up and excite one after another. Gradually, there were more and more voices calling for little turtle to go to the top ten steles.</p>
<p>Even those admirers of Zhou Xinqi could not stop them. They could only watch the popularity of the little turtle rise to a higher level than Zhou Xinqi.</p>
<p>Finally, in the last month, at noon, when the number of disciples in Wanyao pavilion was the largest, Bai Xiaochun disguised herself and showed firmness in her face. While no one was paying attention, she stood in line for a moment and quietly stepped into the wooden house under the tenth stone tablet.</p>
<p>At the moment of stepping in, Bai Xiaochun sits cross legged under the inscription in the wooden house, raises his right hand and presses it on it. His mind roars and appears in the familiar nothingness.</p>
<p>He looked at the millions of plants and pieces of spirit animals flashing in front of him. His eyes showed persistence. His hands were flying in an instant, and he began to examine them. In a flash, he combined the complete herbs and animal materials.</p>
<p>One thousand, five thousand, ten thousand</p>
<p>30000, 50000, 80000</p>
<p>This is the most difficult test he has ever experienced. Gradually, his forehead sweats and his eyes are bloodshot. The whole person, like a madman, forgets everything. He is immersed in the combination of plants, trees and animals. Even his hands are stinging and his brain is in a state of chaos. But he still sticks to his teeth.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how long it has passed. When the assessment of the tenth monument is over, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s right hand trembles slightly. He puts the last herb together. The whole person is like a prosthetic person. His eyes are blurred and clear again. When he is clear again, he has returned to the wooden house.</p>
<p>He was short of breath, but his eyes showed satisfaction. He wiped off his sweat and clenched his fist with great force.</p>

<p>Tonight, keep the appointment!</p>
