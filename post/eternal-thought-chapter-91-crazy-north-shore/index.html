      <p>With the end of the first round, we ushered in the rest time of three sticks of incense. At this moment, all the disciples on the north bank were furious, staring at the south bank, staring at Bai Xiaochun!</p>
<p>They are waiting for the second round to start. They want to use all means to defeat Bai Xiaochun. Even if the north bank wins this time, they don&rsquo;t pay attention to it. At the moment, they only focus on how to wash the former shame!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bai Xiaochun, in this second round, we must let you know that you bring shame to us on the north shore, and we will make you pay a heavy price!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This kind of person should be knocked down by a group of war animals, and only then can he get rid of his hatred. This second round will make him sad all his life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down with Bai Xiaochun, down with this shameless man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The voice of the north bank heard that they wanted to kill Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s heart. At the moment, all the eight people gathered in front of them. Except for the ghost teeth who closed their eyes calmly, the other seven were all grinding their fists.</p>
<p>They knew that they represented the will of all the disciples on the north bank. At this moment, when they looked at Bai Xiaochun, they all had a strong light in their eyes, and they were also analyzing each other&rsquo;s hearts. They were thinking about the details of Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s war just now. Gradually, they all had their own bottom in their hearts and found a way to restrain them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bai Xiaochun just has pills. As long as you don&rsquo;t give him a chance to take out pills, everything will be enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just to win with pills. Without pills, it&rsquo;s easy to kill him. In this second round, he&rsquo;ll lose, and he&rsquo;ll lose miserably!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too much!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s heart is full of grievances. He thinks that the north bank is too bullying. He won a fight, but he was so cruel He wanted to say something, but he was afraid that he would blow up when he spoke.</p>
<p>While the north bank was agitated, the south bank also made an unwilling voice. When the momentum was gradually raised, Ouyang Jie&rsquo;s words suddenly came out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three sticks of incense have passed, the second round of Tianjiao battle, choose the first six!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you are eleven, one of you will be free and go straight to the top six, and the remaining ten will play in pairs according to the order of drawing lots!&rdquo; When Ouyang Jie&rsquo;s words echoed, suddenly, a light appeared on the stage. The light formed a round ball, which was half a foot in size. When floating, eleven people from north and south, including Bai Xiaochun, seemed to be summoned at this moment. They left their hands in an instant and ran straight to the ball to blend into it.</p>
<p>It can be clearly seen that after these beads are integrated into the ball, the number marked on them is replaced by one to ten, and one bead is blank.</p>
<p>Eleven beads kept spinning in it, faster and faster, until the ball became blurred when it could not be seen clearly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the mysterious technique, we cover up the mystery of heaven and seek fairness. Even I can&rsquo;t interfere with the beads in the ball, so you can rest assured. Now, take all of them and choose your own sequence.&rdquo; When Ouyang Jie&rsquo;s voice diffuses, Xu Song on the north bank stares at Bai Xiaochun and sneers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bai Xiaochun, what you pray for this round is not Xu, otherwise, you are doomed to be sad!&rdquo; With that, he raised his hand to take a bead and held it in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No matter who you meet, you will lose the second round, and it will be miserable!&rdquo; A Tianjiao on the north bank clenched his teeth and opened his mouth in a cold voice. All of them raised their right hands and grasped the ball from afar. Bai Xiaochun was also among them and grabbed the past with grievances</p>
<p>In an instant, ten beads flew out and fell to the crowd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m number three!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m number seven!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m number one!&rdquo; After getting the beads, each disciple of the north bank immediately opened his mouth and said his sequence. The momentum spread out with the sequence and rose rapidly. After saying the beads, each of them would look at Bai Xiaochun, showing ferocity in his eyes. The ghost tooth looked down at the bead in his hand and spoke faintly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Number nine!&rdquo; Soon, all the disciples on the north bank outside the battle platform were shocked to find that none of the eight Tianjiao on the north bank had picked up the wheel space and had ten numbers. At the moment, only four and ten were missing. All of them suddenly got nervous and looked at the south bank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m number four!&rdquo; Shangguan Tianyou spoke faintly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten!&rdquo; Zhou Xinqi looks a little ugly. When she speaks her words, she takes a look at the ghost teeth on the north bank.</p>
<p>When everyone except Bai Xiaochun told the sequence, everyone on the south bank looked strangely. Especially the disciples of Xiangyun mountain who had seen Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s original Xiaobi&rsquo;s outer disciples were all wide eyed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No way&hellip;&rdquo; Some of them can&rsquo;t believe it.</p>
<p>What is more unbelievable than them is that they are grinding their fists. All the people on the north bank who are preparing to teach Bai Xiaochun a good lesson this time are all dumbfounded. In an instant, countless eyes from this place gather on Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun couldn&rsquo;t hide his pride. He just saw that there was no number on the ball he had got. He thought he was wrong and looked at it carefully. Then he was sure that at the moment, everyone around him was looking at him, which made Bai Xiaochun feel lonely in his life So the small sleeve a swing, put out a master aloof appearance, look up at the white clouds in the sky, light in the mouth, spread the melancholy voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry, I&rsquo;m empty. If you want to fight me, you should continue to work hard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the spread of his words, there was a short silence around. After a few breaths, there were countless roars and uproar on the north bank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No way, damn it, it&rsquo;s empty! Why is he in the air, this shameless Bai Xiaochun, why is he</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kind of luck is he? Eleven people choose him, but he can still be in the air!! It&rsquo;s unreasonable for such a person to have such luck! &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stand it. I can&rsquo;t stand it. I&rsquo;m going to kill him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The disciples of the outer gate of the north bank intended to wash their shame before this bloodbath. However, they found that they almost spewed out a mouthful of old blood one by one. The incident broke out immediately, forming an endless roar, which made Tianjiao on the north bank fight like a punch on cotton. The feeling made Xu Song and others extremely depressed. When they looked at Bai Xiaochun, they wished they could not separate him with their eyes The corpse.</p>
<p>Even the people on the south bank looked strange and speechless. They had already seen that the north bank wanted to fight Bai Xiaochun, which was incomparably strong. But today&rsquo;s changes, you don&rsquo;t have to think about them. You can know that the depression on the north bank is already overwhelming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this? When Uncle Bai was little bi Twice in the air The outer disciple of Xiangyun mountain could not help but say in a whisper. After being heard by the people around him, they all opened their eyes and revealed their inconceivability.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you ever been empty before? Uncle Bai&rsquo;s luck It&rsquo;s beyond description</p>
<p>With a dry cough, Bai Xiaochun still looks lonely as an expert. He sweeps his eyes across the north bank and shakes his head gently. It seems that the same regret makes the north bank go crazy.</p>
<p>However, no matter how crazy, there is no way. In this stranglehold, the second round of Tianjiao battle has begun.</p>
<p>But without Bai Xiaochun, it seems that the Tianjiao battle has lost interest, especially among the ten people, there are only two people on the south bank, which means that there are three games, i.e., the north bank and myself.</p>
<p>In the first battle of the second round, Gongsun Waner of the north bank and another top ten of the north bank came to the stage together, but they didn&rsquo;t do much at all. The top ten disciples of the north bank were defeated. The south bank was very complicated.</p>
<p>Fortunately, in the Second World War, it was Shangguan Tianyou&rsquo;s turn to fight, but his luck was also excellent. His opponent was not the four Tianjiao in the north bank at the moment, but a top ten disciple. In this war, Shangguan Tianyou won easily, which made people on the south bank feel relieved. At least Won one.</p>
<p>But then, in the third and fourth wars, the north bank was in contention. Although it was also fierce, the feeling that Tianjiao battle had nothing to do with the south bank made the south bank bitter and silent.</p>
<p>Until the last battle, when Zhou Xinqi walked out dignified, the cheers of the south bank were raised, but even the disciples of the south bank were not optimistic about the war.</p>
<p>Because Zhou Xinqi&rsquo;s opponent It is the most terrifying ghost tooth on the north bank. Zeng Yizhi almost killed LV Tianlei.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is better than you and the guy who used thunder before?&rdquo; On the stage, ghost teeth looked at Zhou Xinqi and asked seriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elder martial brother Lu is a little stronger.&rdquo; Zhou Xinqi didn&rsquo;t think that the other party was insulting herself, and she answered it seriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I used 70% force before, but this time I use 40% force. I should not kill you. &quot; The ghost teeth murmured. When the voice came out, all the people around heard were bitter. They believed that although the ghost teeth were true, they could make people despair.</p>
<p>Zhou Xinqi took a deep breath and immediately pinched her hands. Suddenly, there were countless blue lights flying around her body. She even formed a blue flower around her body. Once the flower came out, it immediately sent out bursts of suction!</p>
<p>&ldquo;All kinds of changes are decided by the grass and trees!&rdquo; People on the south bank immediately recognized this technique, and their spirits were shocked. Although this changeable and easy to use method is not as good as ghosts, it is also one of the top ten secret arts.</p>
<p>Li Qinghou even turned a hundred Li into an illusory world of plants and trees. In the end, he could be promoted to a real secret art state of extreme nervousness!</p>
<p>Zhou Xinqi looks pale. It is a great expense for her to use this method. She knows that she is not an opponent, but in her world, she does not take the initiative to admit defeat.</p>
<p>Waving, immediately this blue flower whole body a shock, actually infinite spread, straight to the ghost tooth, is to open the flower, if want to swallow.</p>
<p>At that time, the ghost tooth raised his head, looked calm, and his right hand was still a finger.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not pointing at the sky, but pointing to Zhou Xinqi. Then, the nihility on his right side suddenly roared, and there was a huge black ghost claw, which turned out to be a blow!</p>
<p>The fist was huge, occupying half of the battle platform, covering most of the world in everyone&rsquo;s eyes. One blow hit on the blue flower, which trembled and instantly collapsed into fly ash. The ghost claw did not stop at all. It appeared in front of Zhou Xinqi and fell directly.</p>
<p>The loud noise was so loud that Zhou Xinqi spat out blood. The whole person suddenly rolled back and flew out of the battle platform. After landing, she kept falling back and ejected seven or eight mouths of blood. Then she stood still and looked pale. She looked up at the ghost tooth on the platform and turned to the north bank. Her eyes showed stubborn.</p>
<p>There was silence all around, only the sound of inspiration kept coming out</p>
<p>。</p>
