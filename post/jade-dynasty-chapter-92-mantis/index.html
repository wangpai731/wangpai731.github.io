      <p>The wild dog Taoist followed Guili and walked to the deep of the dead water.</p>
<p>Because just after a heavy rain, the soft land is now more muddy. But somehow, after meeting Qin Wuyan and Jin pinger just now, he insisted that he would not control the magic weapon again, but walk on the ground.</p>
<p>It seems that, like the Golden Vase, he is secretly afraid of something.</p>
<p>In the past, even though the wild dog Taoist didn&rsquo;t swear, at least he complained. But at this moment, he seemed to be a little absent-minded. He didn&rsquo;t say a word, and walked silently behind the ghost, which made the ghost a little strange.</p>
<p>The ghost looked at the wild dog Taoist with some trance, lowered his voice, and said lightly, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter with him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This seems to be a bit of self-talk, because there is no one around except for the cold marsh, pond, water and grass, except the little grey monkey lying on his shoulder.</p>
<p>That is to say, Xiaohui seemed to be drowsy just now, but after listening to this sentence, it suddenly seemed to be stimulated by what, and immediately excited. His eyes were very clever, and he jumped down from his shoulders and began to dance.</p>
<p>This strange behavior, even the wild dog Taoist in the back was scared and looked at it.</p>
<p>I saw Xiaohui looking very excited, grinning and waving at the sharp hands and feet. After a moment, his eyes turned and suddenly jumped to one side. He picked up some water with his hands from the nearby small pond, but fell on his monkey head. Then he pointed to the sky and jumped.</p>
<p>The wild dog Taoist&rsquo;s eyes were all straight. He went to the ghost and said, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter? Is this monkey crazy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But ghost Li frowned, and then whispered to little gray, &ldquo;rain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohui is very happy. She nods her head continuously. Then she folds the leaves of some unknown plants from the side and swings them to the top of her head as if to block something. And make a gesture of wriggling, body wriggling around, and then like a play, leaves from the right hand to the left hand. I changed my left hand to my right.</p>
<p>The wild dog looked at it. Suddenly, without any reason, he felt guilty. He stared at the strange monkey and said to the ghost, &ldquo;crazy, crazy. The monkey must be crazy. &quot;</p>
<p>At the moment, little grey monkey reached out and threw the leaves on his hand. Then he jumped back over his shoulders and pointed to the direction of the road behind them. He kept squeaking.</p>
<p>Ghost Li ponders for a moment, slowly turns around, looks at the wild dog Taoist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You, what do you want me to do?&rdquo; the wild dog Taoist said with a forced smile</p>
<p>With a glance at the package behind him, the ghost said lightly, &ldquo;did you lend or lend the umbrella when it was raining&hellip;&rdquo; At this point, he frowned a little and looked at Xiaohui. After thinking about it, he said, &ldquo;you lent the umbrella to the girl who looks like you to keep out the rain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zhi&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without waiting for the wild dog Taoist to make a sound, the little grey monkey on his shoulder started to jump with a cry. He was very excited. The monkey&rsquo;s face almost narrowed with a smile.</p>
<p>The wild dog Taoist priest&rsquo;s face was red and white, and his face was so embarrassed that he suddenly pointed to the ghost and said angrily: &ldquo;I tell you, my master killed so many people in the past. There are not a thousand or eight hundred people who died in my hands&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost gave him a look. Unexpectedly, he didn&rsquo;t pay any attention to his appearance, turned around and walked away. He said lightly, &ldquo;have you killed a thousand or eight hundred people? What do you have to do with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A wild dog Taoist. Originally, I couldn&rsquo;t say anything more about myself. I just listened to the ghost in front of me and said slowly: &ldquo;besides, you killed a thousand people, 800 people, and what&rsquo;s the relationship with that little girl you lent an umbrella to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this point, he stopped. I look back at the wild dog Taoist.</p>
<p>The wild dog was startled and said: &ldquo;you, you have to do No, say what? &quot;</p>
<p>The ghost Li looked at him up and down, suddenly smiled and said, &ldquo;but today&rsquo;s thing is that since you were in the abyss of the dead, it has surprised me again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned around and walked slowly. His voice was gradually low, but the wild dog could hear it clearly.</p>
<p>“…… I didn&rsquo;t expect you to do the heroic thing to save the beauty! &quot;</p>
<p>The wild dog Taoist was stunned at the spot, and suddenly he was a little distracted. When he came back to his mind, GUI Li had gone far with little ash, almost disappeared in the fog in front of him.</p>
<p>The wild dog Taoist looked in that direction and suddenly jumped into a rage. He stamped his foot and said, &ldquo;bah! I&rsquo;ve never been a bad embryo. I haven&rsquo;t done that kind of thing in my life. Besides, that chick can be called beauty Er! &quot;</p>
<p>The wild dog Taoist reached for his head, then suddenly frowned and stopped. After a while, he seemed to say to himself, &ldquo;that little girl can grow well&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, the wild dog Taoist himself seemed to be stunned. Suddenly, he shook his head violently, swore in a low voice, and strode towards the direction of the ghost. Soon, he disappeared into the increasingly thick fog at night.</p>
<p>There was peace all around, only to see the sky getting darker and darker, the darkness came and gradually submerged everything.</p>
<p>The other end of the dead end.</p>
<p>Yu Yangzi, the leader of the immortal Hall of the demon sect, is in white. He stands with his hands in his hands and looks up to the sky. The night wind in the swamp blows and blows his skirt slightly. He looks extraordinary, like a fairy.</p>
<p>In addition to his left hand, the sleeves are empty, adding some inexplicable funny.</p>
<p>That was the sign of the first World War in Qingyun Mountain when he was hurt by the first strange sword in the world.</p>
<p>The night wind is slightly cool, and the air seems to be still wet with the just heavy rain. The darkness is all around, but only his figure is still standing there, rebellious and conspicuous.</p>
<p>In the darkness behind him, there was a faint breath. It was his doorman who was hiding in the darkness, waiting patiently for his orders in the darkness.</p>
<p>The immortal Hall of the demon sect rose eight hundred years ago and spread to the generation of yuyangzi. It is the seventh generation. It has a long history. But no one knows better than yuyangzi himself. Behind the boundless scenery, the crisis faced by the immortal hall.</p>
<p>leave no successor!</p>
<p>Ten years ago, in the first battle of Qingyun, yuyangzi was promoted as the host by the other three sects of the demon sect. This is the most prestigious and peak time of longevity hall among the demons in these hundreds of years.</p>
<p>At that time, yuyangzi was satisfied with his ambition. He had more than ten proud experts, all of whom he had cultivated painstakingly in the past hundred years.</p>
<p>At that time, yuyangzi really thought that there was no obstacle to him in the world, as long as he defeated the old Qingyun gate at one stroke. Changshengtang is famous for its awe of demons. With its own strength and the help of its experts, changshengtang is the second blood refining hall in 800 years. Will also become the second black heart old man!</p>
<p>Just, this kind of beautiful dream, but in Qingyun Mountain, under the sword of the devil, turned into a bubble!</p>
<p>He himself lost a left hand in the killing immortal sword array.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to say that the immortal hall is the leader of the sect. The experts are naturally in the front line of the battle, and the elders of Qingyun sect and Tongtian peak are half consumed first.</p>
<p>Later, the immortal sword array was launched, and the remaining experts of the longevity hall were in a mess of death and injury. The people who escaped were only one or two, almost all the troops were destroyed.</p>
<p>In this world, everything is easy to get, the most difficult to get is talent. Especially the person who can be trusted completely!</p>
<p>In the past ten years, yuyangzi has worked hard, and the longevity hall has gradually improved, but in yuyangzi&rsquo;s heart, the shadow is growing.</p>
<p>In the first battle of Qingyun, the main forces of the hall of eternal life were almost completely destroyed. In recent years, if it wasn&rsquo;t for yuyangzi&rsquo;s high cultivation, all the enemies around him would be shocked, especially seven years ago. He decided to move the main hall to death swamp, a remote place, far away from the influence of the other three sects. Otherwise, the consequences are unknown.</p>
<p>However, just a month ago, the increasingly fierce internal fighting in the demon sect came to an abrupt end, and the last powerful small and medium-sized school blood refining hall was finally accepted by the ghost King clan.</p>
<p>All the people are on the line. After a brief and suffocating calm, yuyangzi intuitively predicted that the next thing would be a fierce internal fight among the four great sects of the demon sect.</p>
<p>After all, in the hearts of countless disciples of the demon sect, the figure that black heart old man unified the demon sect and dominated the world 800 years ago is a legend forever!</p>
<p>But legend goes back to legend. At this moment, it is extremely unfavorable to the longevity hall and even yuyangzi. Limited by its strength, changshengtang is powerless in the internal struggle for small and medium-sized faction valves. As a result, it has opened a gap with the other three faction valves in terms of its strength. Yu Yangzi is worried about this and can hardly sleep at night.</p>
<p>Also at this time, as if heaven opened his eyes, in the side of the hall of eternal life, the strange omen of the birth of a strange treasure suddenly appeared in the swamp of death.</p>
<p>Yuyangzi was surprised and delighted. If he could get a treasure like Qingyun sect&rsquo;s &ldquo;ancient sword of killing immortals&rdquo;, it would be no problem to protect himself in the hall of longevity first, and then develop slowly. In the future, he may not be able to turn over.</p>
<p>In this case, the hall of longevity regards the strange treasure in the dead water as the thing in the bag, and never allow others to touch it. But I don&rsquo;t know who has leaked the news. Within a few days, it has been spread around the world. Suddenly, the world looks around, and the good and evil experts gather to die.</p>
<p>Yuyangzi was shocked and angry, but at this moment, he was not allowed to retreat, so he got up all the strength of the longevity hall and arranged it in the dead water. On the one hand, he tried his best to find the whereabouts of the strange treasure, on the other hand, he was responsible for sniping and killing the foreign enemies. In these tens of days, there are no less than dozens of people killed in the dead water by the longevity hall, including not only righteous Sanxian, but also experts of other sects of the demon sect.</p>
<p>In order to survive, yuyangzi is desperate!</p>
<p>This night, yuyangzi got a secret report under the door. Near the &ldquo;bottomless pit&rdquo; outside the dead water front, a group of people in the middle of the road settled down and prepared to spend the night there. And in the next wave of spy returns, yuyangzi&rsquo;s face is getting cold, and he knows who those people are.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a group of the most elite young disciples under the Qingyun gate. There were only a dozen of them, but when they heard the return from the scouts, the number of them had reached as many as ten. Among them, there were monks and people dressed in incense valley. Yuyangzi frowned, took a deep breath, looked at the distance, as if waiting for something.</p>
<p>After a while, a slight step sounded suddenly in the darkness behind him. A middle-aged man who looked smart and thin came out and came to yuyangzi. Yuyangzi immediately turned around to face him. Obviously, he was a special person.</p>
<p>This middle-aged man, Meng Ji, is one of the best experts in the longevity hall under yuyangzi. He is also one of the few remaining experts in the longevity hall after the first World War in Qingyun Mountain, so he is deeply believed by yuyangzi. At this moment, yuyangzi is too late to make up his mind, and also to wait for this man to come back.</p>
<p>Meng Ji salutes Yu Yangzi, who shakes his head slightly. &ldquo;Forget it, don&rsquo;t be polite. What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is no end to this question, but Meng Ji obviously knows what Yu Yangzi is asking. He whispers: &ldquo;his subordinates have taken people to the Heishuigou and Baimahe areas on the other side of the dead River to search, but they have not found the ghost King clan, the wandumen and the Hehuan faction entering in a large scale. There are only a few small faction figures who are single. My subordinates have dealt with it directly. &quot;</p>
<p>When Yu Yangzi&rsquo;s spirit rose, he smiled for the first time and nodded: &ldquo;OK! So we have no worries. Tonight, we will make an all-out raid on those young people who don&rsquo;t know the height of the earth. Get rid of these people first, then we can&rsquo;t fight for the right way! &quot;</p>
<p>Meng Ji didn&rsquo;t seem to be happy, but he was worried, hesitated for a moment, and finally said: &ldquo;sect leader.</p>
<p>But three days ago, the secret post near Dawang village sent back the news. It seems that Gui Li and Qin Wuyan have arrived near the dead water, and the gold bottle of the joy sect has always been wandering. We can&rsquo;t help but guard against it! &quot;</p>
<p>The muscles on yuyangzi&rsquo;s face trembled, showing a look of resentment and a voice of hatred: &ldquo;how can I not know this! It&rsquo;s just that those people want that treasure, but all the members of the ten thousand poisons sect and the ghost King sect want my life! &quot;</p>
<p>Meng Ji was shocked, but he didn&rsquo;t know what he was thinking. His face was uncertain, and he whispered, &ldquo;Lord, what shall we do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yuyangzi snorted, took a deep breath, slowed down, and said: &ldquo;now, we have no way back. In the absence of horses sent by the ten thousand poisons gate, the ghost King clan and Hehuan, we first solved the problems of the right way, and then searched for the strange treasure with all our strength, once we got it. According to the strange omens of the previous days, this must be a treasure that has never been born. We are not afraid of the other three sects! &quot;</p>
<p>Meng Ji said with a low head: &ldquo;the sect leader has a high opinion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yuyangzi nodded slightly, then turned around. Fixed his mind, stretched out his only right hand now, waved forward heavily in the night, and suddenly in the dark, the shadows gathered. A moment later, a large number of students of the longevity hall appeared, moving towards the direction of yuyangzi&rsquo;s fingers. Run away.</p>
<p>The night was bleak and murderous!</p>
<p>Dead swamp, no pit.</p>
<p>This piece of land looks flat in the daytime, but I don&rsquo;t know why it has such a strange name. Except for the villagers who live near the dead water for a long time, they know that in this area, a large area of land in the middle looks exactly the same as the surrounding area, which is full of messy grass. In fact, it&rsquo;s a huge bottomless mud pit, in which the silt suction is very strong, and ordinary people accidentally step on it In, it took a moment to be sucked down, and then it rotted silently in the deep swamp.</p>
<p>The reason why death Ze got its name is in the swamp. There are countless invisible and horrible places to kill people!</p>
<p>However, the right young people are obviously not comparable to ordinary people.</p>
<p>Qingyun gate and a group of ten people walked in the dead water for several days. They met the disciples sent by Tianyin temple and burning incense Valley before and after. They all met in one place, but there were acquaintances here.</p>
<p>Tianyin temple still takes the Dharma phase and Dharma goodness as the first, and among the disciples of incense Valley, there are also Li Xun and Yan Hong, but after meeting each other, their relationship is not the same.</p>
<p>The disciples of Qingyun sect, led by Xiao Yicai, get along well with all the people of Tianyin temple. They talk and laugh, but the group of burning incense Valley is slightly estranged from the two sects. It seems that they keep a distance intentionally.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s delicate. Everyone knows what they want, but on the surface, it&rsquo;s still hospitable. The three great righteous factions are still working together for the justice and morality of the world, cutting off demons and demons, and eliminating demons!</p>
<p>All the people spent the night in the vicinity of the abyss. After burning the bonfire and telling the younger martial brothers and sisters not to walk around at will, Xiao Yicai invited Li Xun of Tianyin temple and burning incense Valley to one side to discuss in a low voice.</p>
<p>At this moment, Li Xun frowned slightly, and there was disdain in his eyes, but he was still amiable on his face. He whispered: &ldquo;elder martial brother Xiao, do you worry more</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai smiled and said, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s your opinion, elder martial brother Li! I&rsquo;m all ears. &quot;</p>
<p>Seeing the eyes of Xiao Yicai and FA Xiang looking at themselves, Li Xun paused for a moment, and then said: &ldquo;I thought that since my three schools came to Ze, the situation has been overwhelming, and the disciples sent by the longevity hall have been defeated by us again and again. Moreover, since the end of the Qingyun Mountain war, the death and injury of the expert of Changsheng hall, except for one yuyangzi, are still struggling for the overall situation, and the rest are not at all worrying. Elder martial brother Xiao said that it was too dangerous tonight. &quot;</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai pondered for a moment and said: &ldquo;what elder martial brother Li said is true. But in the immortality Hall of the demon sect, the sect leader yuyangzi has a high level of Taoism. We can&rsquo;t underestimate him alone. In addition, it has been 800 years since the immortality hall became one of the four major sects of the demon sect. The so-called &ldquo;one hundred foot bug&rdquo; died without being rigid. They are determined to get the unique treasure. They will inevitably jump over the wall. We&rsquo;d better be careful! &quot;</p>
<p>FA Xiang nodded: &ldquo;elder martial brother Xiao is right. We really need to be careful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Li Xun saw that both of them were talking like this, he couldn&rsquo;t say anything more. However, he was arrogant, and his eyes still showed some expression. He said lightly, &ldquo;according to the two elder martial brothers, what should we do tonight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>FA Xiang looked at him and was stunned. He turned to Xiao Yi and looked at him. However, Xiao Yi did nothing, as if he didn&rsquo;t see anything. He still smiled and said, &ldquo;elder martial brother Li is really wise. He is the best of his brother. He will succeed in the future. Elder martial brother Li should remember his first skill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li Xun smiled, but he didn&rsquo;t thank him.</p>
<p>FA Xiang looks at Xiao Yicai&rsquo;s face, which is full of happiness and anger. Suddenly, he passes the figure of the young man named &ldquo;Zhang Xiaofan&rdquo;. If he is here today, how nice</p>
<p>He sighed a pain in his heart for no reason. Then he heard Xiao Yicai&rsquo;s low voice and began to arrange. He listened attentively. Only Xiao Yicai lowered his voice and said softly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two senior brothers, tonight we&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Night, as if a little deeper.</p>
<p>The night in the death swamp seems to be shrouded in black clouds. Maybe every night, the fog rises in this huge swamp.</p>
<p>The night sky is gray, not to mention the moon, not even half a star.</p>
<p>Near the bottomless pit, where the orthodox young disciples sleep at night, everything is quiet and silent except for a few remnants of the campfire.</p>
<p>In the dark, the orthodox disciples curled up in the clothes and covers their bodies tightly. After all, the young people are not able to cultivate enough to withstand the cold night.</p>
<p>The disciples of the longevity hall silently surrounded the group from all directions and waited for yuyangzi&rsquo;s order in the dark.</p>
<p>Yuyangzi slowly extended his only right hand.</p>
<p>Standing beside him, Meng Ji suddenly whispered, &ldquo;sect leader.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yuyangzi '</p>
<p>Meng Ji seemed to feel yuyangzi&rsquo;s dissatisfaction. After hesitating for a moment, he said: &ldquo;sect leader, look at these people in the right way, how can they not even have a watchman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yu Yangzi was stunned for a moment, and then said to the sun: &ldquo;these yellow boys are arrogant. These days, I even played down the enemy&rsquo;s plan. They thought we were vulnerable and didn&rsquo;t pay attention to us at all. It&rsquo;s no surprise that they didn&rsquo;t watch the night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meng Ji&rsquo;s face moved, and finally he was silent.</p>
<p>Yuyangzi didn&rsquo;t deal with him any more. When he turned his right hand, he saw a strange mirror with black and white sides in his hand. Then he flew up into the sky and slid a dazzling light in the night.</p>
<p>All the students of Changsheng hall shouted at the same time, spreading far away in the night, swarming up, with boundless killing intention!</p>
<p>In that fragile residual light, there is a touch of desolation.</p>
<p>The last bit of ashes, at this moment, quietly put out!</p>
<p>Darkness drowns!</p>
<p>A moment later, there was a sharp and clear sound, a clanging dragon.</p>
<p>A blue light, a blue light, a gold light, a white light, a blue light.</p>
<p>Five brilliant lights, like sharp swords that pierce the sky in the dark of the night, suddenly appear in the deepest part of the darkness and rush to those immortal disciples.</p>
<p>And behind them, more dazzling light, one after another.</p>
<p>Yuyangzi&rsquo;s face changed greatly when he saw it in his eyes! (to be continued. )</p>
