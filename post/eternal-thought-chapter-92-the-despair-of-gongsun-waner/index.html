      <p>&ldquo;Too Too strong</p>
<p>&ldquo;This ghost tooth, I&rsquo;m afraid even the inner disciples can crush it directly. It&rsquo;s really the first person to build the foundation!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pinnacle of this kind of condensed gas combat power must have touched the realm of mind. It must be so. Only with the mysterious and unpredictable mind can we have this kind of terrifying power!&rdquo; After a brief silence, low voices came out from the south bank and the north bank.</p>
<p>It seems that no one dares to speak up at this time. The other Tianjiao on the north bank are all complicated. No one wants to have such a strong man in the same era. Here on the south bank, Shangguan Tianyou is silent. His heart is not calm. This ghost tooth defeats Tianjiao, just like Tianjiao defeating ordinary disciples.</p>
<p>Obviously, ghost teeth and Tianjiao are not at the same level at all.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun was also shocked. The other side only shot twice, but each time shocked everyone.</p>
<p>At the moment, the first six have already decided, four on the north bank and two on the south bank, namely Shangguan Tianyou, Bai Xiaochun, guiya, Gongsun brother and sister, and Xu Song.</p>
<p>The disciples who have known about Tianjiao battle know that the next third round will also be the last round. In this round, all the top six players have to fight with their opponents respectively. According to the number of victories, they can choose the place of the first six.</p>
<p>If you can win five games, you will be the first!</p>
<p>In the past thousand years, every time such a sweeping disciple appeared in the north bank and won the crown. This time, all the outer disciples of the north bank understood that ghost tooth This is the kind of person, and obviously more powerful than the one who swept everything in the past.</p>
<p>The south bank is silent. If there is no ghost tooth, they think Shangguan Tianyou still has hope, but now it seems that Shangguan Tianyou can hardly compete for the first place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Second, it&rsquo;s ok&hellip;&rdquo; The disciples of Nan&rsquo;an sighed one after another, and many of their eyes fell on Bai Xiaochun. For Bai Xiaochun, none of them could tell what they felt. Even if they thought about it anyway, they didn&rsquo;t have the impression of Bai Xiaochun. It was as if he had never had a fight with others since he entered the mountain gate.</p>
<p>The only impression is that the other side came back alive in the pursuit of the Luochen family. In addition, there is no</p>
<p>In silence, many people have given up in their hearts. They know that this time, the south bank lost again. The total number of people who lost the top ten also lost the first place.</p>
<p>Compared with the south bank, at this moment, the outer disciples on the north bank were all excited and looked forward to. They were all staring at Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first six rules should not be changed. This time, Bai Xiaochun will be miserable!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, according to the rules, he has to fight everyone once, that is to say Each of the four scorching suns on my north bank can severely ravage him and vent his shame on my north bank! &quot;</p>
<p>Not only do the ordinary disciples on the north bank think so. Xu Song and Gongsun brothers and sisters sneer at each other. When they look at Bai Xiaochun, they are determined to get it.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun shrunk her head and sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cultivating immortals is to live forever. Why fight and kill&hellip;&rdquo; He is very helpless, looking at all his students on the north bank, sighing and shaking his head, Ouyang Jie&rsquo;s voice suddenly spreads out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the third round of Tianjiao battle, the rules are still the same. In the first round, Shangguan Tianyou, Xu Song, guiya, gongsunyun are next, Bai Xiaochun and Gongsun Waner are the last. At the same time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the words echoed, a light fell from the upper terrace and went straight to the battle platform. In an instant, the battle platform was divided into three areas, separated from each other and sealed off.</p>
<p>Shangguan Tianyou&rsquo;s eyes suddenly show the essence of his eyes, and his body rushes out in an instant. Almost at the same time as he appears, Xu Song flies out of the north bank like Xu Song. They both look at each other and see the solemnity of each other.</p>
<p>When they looked at each other, Xu Song waved, and immediately there were fierce beasts roaring all around. Three fierce beasts appeared in different shapes, but they were all ferocious. While they went straight to Shangguan Tianyou, a huge whale mouth suddenly appeared in the sky above Shangguan Tianyou, and suddenly swallowed it.</p>
<p>Under his feet, in the clatter of the ground, the tentacles came out and twisted.</p>
<p>At the same time, the ghost tooth walked out slowly. Gongsun Yun was silent. The insects in his eyes seemed to be shaking. He knew that the ghost tooth was strong, but he didn&rsquo;t want to admit defeat, and his eyes showed his essence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No matter how good you are, I will fight!&rdquo; He took a deep breath, rolled his robes, and went to the second area of the platform with the ghost teeth.</p>
<p>Gongsun Wan&rsquo;er hums coldly and comes out and stares at Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>This is what Bai Xiaochun is most afraid of, so she stares at each other and goes to the third area of the battle platform.</p>
<p>Almost in the moment Bai Xiaochun came to power, the outside disciples on the north bank immediately roared, not to pay attention to the war between the other two regions, but to all look at Bai Xiaochun here, with anger in one eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elder martial sister Gongsun, kill this damn little white pure!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kill him!&rdquo; When the roar echoed, Gongsun Waner saw a flash of cold light, did not call her colorful Phoenix, but right hand pinched a finger eyebrow heart, immediately her body actually appeared colorful light, more cold cold, spread out in a moment, making the ground all frost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You lose, I&rsquo;m afraid of it once I get out.&rdquo; White Xiaochun blinked, kind-hearted opening.</p>
<p>As soon as he said this, Gongsun Waner had a scene of cold north in her mind, and immediately became red and angry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut up, you are a vain man. This time, you must pay for it!&rdquo; She said, right hand suddenly a wave, an ice edge suddenly appeared, straight to white xiaopure.</p>
<p>White small innocent face, he just said a good word, also did not know how to become a disciple, at this moment sighed, right hand a pat of storage bags, immediately numerous spells appeared, he was very skilled directly patted on the body.</p>
<p>The sound of bombardment appeared in a flash. A protective light was just a meter thick and colorful. It was amazing. It was not over yet. Bai Xiaochun took out the crane shield, and immediately the shield was shining, and it surrounded the white Xiaochun and a light was added.</p>
<p>And on his wrist, Li Qinghou sent his bracelet, which was also inspired at this moment, spread directly all over the body, making his whole person look black.</p>
<p>With the big pot behind, this moment of white and small pure It dazzles everyone.</p>
<p>When the white and small pure make these, the incomparable speed and proficiency, let a person see at a glance, he often does this</p>
<p>All the disciples on the north bank opened their eyes and looked at the ice blade stupidly. After meeting the light of protection on the white and pure body, they weakened at each level, and finally, they crashed.</p>
<p>The white and small pure in the protection light are undamaged.</p>
<p>If only that is the case, all the northern bank disciples are angry to see that the white and small pure in the light curtain actually back their hands, raise their chin, look at the clouds in the sky, a master of the appearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too weak for me to fight anyone who can&rsquo;t break my protective layer.&rdquo; White small pure small sleeve a throw, continue to back hands, light opening.</p>
<p>Gongsun Wan&rsquo;er&rsquo;s eyes were almost staring out, and the whole person was stunned. She fought with people too many times. She didn&rsquo;t see anyone who was good at protection, but she was as protective as Bai Xiaochun. This was the first time in her life.</p>
<p>She looked at the protective light with at least dozens of layers, the God crane shield inside, the black thing on Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s body, and the big pot behind him. She even vaguely saw Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s body, which seemed to be wearing many leather clothes.</p>
<p>She felt that the whole person was not well, and her expression was in a trance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shameless!! There are so many protective charms and magic weapons. Damn it, it&rsquo;s Tianjiao battle. It&rsquo;s not better than who has resources</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elder martial sister Gongsun must kill him. I&rsquo;m going to blow it up. When I see Bai Xiaochun, I want to beat him up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the north bank roared, the south bank was also dumbfounded. However, some of the disciples of Xiangyun mountain felt a lot of emotion at the moment. Especially, there was a big man inside. He saw this behind the scenes, and there were tears in his eyes. He understood the north bank very well, because he was the one who was tortured by the light of protection of Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>Even the leader on the terrace and others were speechless and looked at each other with bitter smiles.</p>
<p>In the third area of the battle platform, Gongsun Wan&rsquo;er bit her silver teeth and pinched her hands. At once, a large number of ice blades appeared around her, forming a whirlpool. At this moment, Bai Xiaochun went straight away. The sound of roar rose from the sky. Those ice blades were extremely sharp, and the layers of protection were opened. You can see that many of them were blown open. The flash of the divine crane shield immediately dissolved all of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still too weak.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun spoke with pride, and his heart was full of joy, and he had a great sense of pride as a strong man.</p>
<p>This scene makes people on the north bank even more angry. If it&rsquo;s not for daring to violate the rules, I&rsquo;m afraid everyone has the impulse to kill Bai Xiaochun together.</p>
<p>Gongsun Wan&rsquo;er&rsquo;s eyes were filled with evil spirit. She gritted her teeth and took another shot. This time, more ice blades appeared, and even she didn&rsquo;t finish. She always maintained the technique, which made the ice blade continuous and went straight to Bai Xiaochun. The momentum was amazing and it was very frightening. Bai Xiaochun was also shocked. The protection around him collapsed immediately after he insisted on a few minutes. The Shenhe shield was running rapidly and the protection was tight in the blink of an eye This just let Bai Xiaochun heart bottom relief, lift chin again, just about to open mouth.</p>
<p>Gongsun Wan&rsquo;er was dishevelled and screamed. A roar was heard all over his body. Blood was spilled from the corners of his mouth. A bloody ice flower appeared at the center of his eyebrows. The force of the heaven and earth around him suddenly surged in with extraordinary momentum.</p>
<p>At the same time, the north shore spread earth shaking cheers, many people are excited to roar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s elder martial sister Gongsun&rsquo;s blood ice flower!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This blood ice flower is Gongsun elder martial sister&rsquo;s assassin&rsquo;s mace. Even the ninth layer of condensate can&rsquo;t be stopped. No matter how much protection Bai Xiaochun has, it will be defeated!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ice flower flew out quickly, sending out bursts of terror. It changed the surrounding temperature, and immediately flew to Bai Xiaochun. All the protective lights collapsed. The God crane shield was just about to stop it. The bloody ice flower was actually divided into two parts, one was blocked and the other was twisted. It appeared in front of Bai Xiaochun and was severely printed on his chest.</p>
<p>With a bang, Bai Xiaochun lowered her head in surprise. She felt as if she had been hit by a snowball. When she looked up, she looked at Gongsun Wan&rsquo;er, who was dazzled and disheveled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You play slowly. I&rsquo;ll watch the game.&rdquo; With that, Bai Xiaochun turned around and looked at the fight between the first and the second regions. He even yelled for help from time to time</p>
