      <p>Huqi mountain, the blood pool of ghost King clan.</p>
<p>At present, the situation of the four spirits and blood array in the blood pool is different from that of the previous few days. The four huge spirit beasts seem to have lost their spirituality completely. They just lie down in the blood pool and water, and the dark red light curtain that covers them becomes weak. If you don&rsquo;t watch carefully, you can hardly see them. You can only see that the remaining spirit spirits are constantly being absorbed by the sky Fu Long Ding sucked away.</p>
<p>In contrast to the desperation and powerlessness of the four spirit beasts, the whole blood pool seems to have been affected by an invisible force. On the huge water surface, everywhere seems to be boiling, and there are continuous bubbles coming out and cracking, making a dull sound. At the same time, the blood in the blood pool, which was not moving at all, actually began to rotate on its own, shooting several strange lights from the air, shining on the blood and water, and the blood and water were turbulent in succession.</p>
<p>In the air, filled with a thick smell of blood.</p>
<p>On the Fulong tripod, the pattern of the last remnant of the ferocious God is finally the same color as the whole body of the ancient tripod. The whole Fulong Ding is now completely different from its original appearance. On the contrary, after absorbing the huge spiritual power, the strange magic power in this ancient tripod seems to be slowly triggered out.</p>
<p>Alone in the void, Fulong Ding overlooks everything, as if all things are at its feet, crawling to it. And in the huge space, around the Fulong Ding, there is the sound of wind and thunder. Corresponding to it, the strange light around the Fulong Ding is bright and extinguished at the same time. It is actually like a person&rsquo;s panting, sometimes not, extremely strange.</p>
<p>An invisible force seems to be quietly breeding in this huge space, and it is like a God who has been sleeping for thousands of years, and is about to wake up.</p>
<p>The turbulent and strange force, like waves, galloped over the blood pool, pounding against the surrounding stone walls.</p>
<p>Looking at the strange scene, the ghost king and Mr. ghost stood side by side without speaking. But it was obvious from their two bodies that there was no trace of fear or retreat.</p>
<p>After a long time. However, the ghost King laughed and said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s really powerful. The date of July 7-49 hasn&rsquo;t arrived yet, and the four spirit blood array has not yet formed. It&rsquo;s so powerful! &ldquo;.</p>
<p>Mr. GUI didn&rsquo;t immediately answer. He was silent for a moment and said, &ldquo;Lord, the change happened several days ago is really caused by the blood array of four spirits. I&rsquo;m not good at protecting the array. Please punish me.</p>
<p>As soon as the ghost King waved his hand, he didn&rsquo;t look at Mr. ghost. When he stepped on, his eyes still remained on the Fulong Ding. He said in his mouth, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s just a trivial matter. Needless to say, this array is too powerful, not to mention you, even I don&rsquo;t expect it. It&rsquo;s inevitable that you make a mistake.</p>
<p>Mr. ghost hesitated for a moment and said, &ldquo;thank you for your magnanimity, just&hellip;&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The ghost king turned around and said, &ldquo;just what?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Mr. ghost met the ghost King&rsquo;s eyes, and suddenly his heart was shocked. He only felt that the ghost King&rsquo;s eyes were strange and dazzling. With his own way of doing, he seemed to have a feeling that he could not look at him. Several thoughts flashed in his mind, but fortunately, his face was covered with black veil, and others could not see his expression. At least according to his accent, it is still plain: &ldquo;as the LORD said, the four spirits blood array is very powerful, and it is getting closer with the formation. This spiritual power will only become stronger and stronger. Although I have laid down 18 prohibitions around the blood pool, to be honest, I really don&rsquo;t have a complete grasp of it, especially on the last day when the blood array was completed. It must be an earth shaking scene. It&rsquo;s hard to say whether the prohibitions I&rsquo;ve set up are useful. I&rsquo;m afraid that if we don&rsquo;t take precautions at that time, some of our disciples outside the mountain will probably be implicated. &ldquo;.</p>
<p>The ghost King sneered and said, &ldquo;so what?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Mr. ghost smothered for a moment, looked at the ghost king, and was silent for a moment. He said, &ldquo;I just remind the Lord that if necessary, some weak disciples may withdraw from the mountainside in advance.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The ghost King&rsquo;s eyes flashed and snorted, &ldquo;no need.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Mr. ghost didn&rsquo;t speak.</p>
<p>The king of the devil said coldly: &ldquo;this heaven and earth array, the essence of four spirits, is what is raised by blood and blood, but it is blood and fierce and fierce. It can open the door of repair, and some people are buried with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost nodded slowly and said, &ldquo;yes, I understand.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The ghost King laughed and looked arrogant. He turned around and took a deep breath. His eyes fell on the Fulong tripod again. Looking at the changeable tripod, his eyes seemed to be intoxicated.</p>
<p>But behind him, Mr. ghost&rsquo;s eyes were thoughtful, but more of them were not fanatical, but cold and sober.</p>
<p>Qingyun Mountain, dragon head peak.</p>
<p>Among the seven veins of Qingyun, Longshou peak is second only to Tongtian peak. It is tall, steep and towering. The night was dark and the wind was high. In a secret mountain forest behind the dragon head peak, a path was winding forward and winding around the mountain forest.</p>
<p>When the cold night wind blows, two figures, one tall and one low, fall from the sky and fall on this path. They are Taoist Cangsong and jinpinger.</p>
<p>This place is far away from the temples and pavilions where a group of disciples of Longshou peak live in front of the mountain. Usually, few people come here. In the dead of night, there is no voice. Cangsong Taoist looked cold, looked around, looked up at the sky, and suddenly hummed.</p>
<p>Jin pinger looked at him with great interest and said, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter, Taoist priest, it seems that you look very angry?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Cangsong Taoist said coldly: &ldquo;this class of disciples are becoming more and more useless. It&rsquo;s a waste of my efforts.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Gold bottle son pour some curiosity to rise, way: &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Taoist Cangsong hummed and walked along the path. At the same time, he said coldly: &ldquo;although it seems that this is the key place of heaven&rsquo;s secrets behind the mountain, it&rsquo;s no different from other places, but the ancestors have left instructions from generation to generation, and all the disciples need to be strictly guarded. At present, it&rsquo;s only the second shift, and I can&rsquo;t see any people. What a group of rubbish! &ldquo;.</p>
<p>The Golden Vase son smiles and says, &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t it convenient for us to act like this? You should be happy.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Cangsong Taoist priest again uttered a cold hum, but he could not see any happy and joyful color on his face. Instead, he was extremely ugly and strode forward.</p>
<p>Jin pinger followed him and said with a smile: &ldquo;in fact, you can&rsquo;t blame the disciples of Qingyun gate. As far as I know, Qingyun gate hasn&rsquo;t been opened several times in a thousand years. It&rsquo;s just the last time that the beast demon was robbed. The beast God is so strong that it has to be opened once. If it&rsquo;s someone who says no for such a long time, plus you elders keep these things secret. Ordinary disciples just think it&rsquo;s an ordinary forbidden area without anything. It&rsquo;s normal to be lazy a few times. &ldquo;.</p>
<p>Her smile was charming and said to Cang song: &ldquo;not to mention. You will lead the way along the way. It is said that you have presided over the affairs of Qingyun Mountain in recent decades, especially these precautions. Those mountain patrol disciples can&rsquo;t find us, and they can&rsquo;t blame them. Don&rsquo;t you think so.</p>
<p>Taoist Cangsong still looks ugly. To him, it seems that every plant and tree on Qingyun Mountain is different from other places. Once upon a time, he was the master of the mountain.</p>
<p>The road in the past, did you really go right?.</p>
<p>Cangsong Taoist suddenly shook his head, as if to shake off some ideas, strode forward, gold bottle son looking at his back.</p>
<p>It seems that she has understood the Taoist&rsquo;s state of mind, but she is obviously not a good person with a good heart, but her eyes show a bit of schadenfreude. The corners of her mouth are slightly cocked, and her appearance is beautiful and soft, and her steps seem to be light. She follows the Taoist Cangsong and walks along the path towards the back mountain of dragon head peak.</p>
<p>The path was so deep that after a long time of twists and turns, there was still no end to it. However, with the deepening of the road, more and more weeds on the side of the road gradually covered the path. Obviously, no one walked here for a long time. Even the vegetation is flourishing.</p>
<p>Looking at these roadside weeds gradually growing on the path, Taoist Cangsong&rsquo;s face became more and more ugly, looking quite iron green. Jin pinger doesn&rsquo;t talk to him at the moment. She just follows behind and looks at the tall back of Cangsong Taoist. She suddenly has a feeling. The man was afraid that he might not be just a traitor to the right way.</p>
<p>But even so, who cares? If the Taoist Cangsong was discovered by his classmates, he would be in a situation of life and death struggle. But ten years ago, he was the most powerful person in the world&rsquo;s No.1 sect. Who would have thought of this?.</p>
<p>There are many twists and turns in life, but I don&rsquo;t know whether it is the mortal who controls it, or it is determined by the will of heaven. So there is the saying that the will of heaven makes people?.</p>
<p>As she walked all the way, Jin pinger suddenly remembered the little ring she had just met. The young girl who had a long relationship with her seemed to be trapped in love at her young age! Think of the small ring, her expression will ease down, there is a bit of warmth, perhaps only that little girl, is the only one she can open her heart to treat it.</p>
<p>Maybe there will be a chance in the future. It&rsquo;s good to wander around the world with Xiaohuan!.</p>
<p>A faint smile appeared in the corner of the Golden Vase&rsquo;s mouth, but the smile flashed by, and she stood still. Because the Taoist Cang song in front of her also stopped and took a long breath. Listening to his voice, he seemed to be mixed with a very strange feeling. He said slowly, &ldquo;this is where the lock of the dragon head peak in Qingyun gate lies.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>At last, the path under his feet reached the end. Jin Ping&rsquo;er stepped forward, but he was stunned for a moment. He turned his head to Taoist Cangsong and said, &ldquo;what, this is heaven&rsquo;s Secret lock?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Cang song Taoist had no expression, and only nodded lightly.</p>
<p>What appeared before them was not a shining celestial artifact, nor a solemn and majestic building. Before arriving here, jinpinger had thought about it for countless times, but in any case did not guess that the legendary lock of heaven would look like this.</p>
<p>In front of her, is an ordinary pit.</p>
<p>If there is any difference, it is that the pit is relatively large and deep, and it is a big pit. However, it looks like an ordinary big pit in terms of the overgrown weeds and the decaying mountain soil. Where does it look like something related to the famous Zhuxian sword array?.</p>
<p>Jinpinger is still hard to accept, but the Taoist Cangsong on one side has already jumped down. Standing under the pit, he waves to jinpinger. Jinpinger sighs and jumps down.</p>
<p>After jumping into the pit and stepping on the solid soil at the bottom of the pit, the Golden Vase smelled a strong smell of soil. She looked up and saw that the pit was quite deep. She didn&rsquo;t feel anything from up to down just now. When she got down to the bottom, she found that the edge of the pit was actually one and a half high.</p>
<p>The soil in the pit is not as hard and easy to walk as on the path, and it is slightly soft. Fortunately, there is no wind and rain these days. The soil is still dry and hard, not deep and shallow, but potholes are inevitable.</p>
<p>Jinpinger followed the Taoist Cangsong and walked to the deep of the pit. The terrain here is inclined inward. The more you go down, the more you look up at the trees around you and the mountains in the distance, you will feel that all these things are tall. And I also gradually have a small feeling floating in my heart.</p>
<p>These strange emotions reverberated in her heart, which made her feel uncomfortable, but fortunately, although the pit was large, it was not boundless. Soon, Taoist Cangsong stopped, and a Golden Vase stopped.</p>
<p>They were in the middle of the big pit. The soil was all around, and a few piles of soil piled up in the middle to form a small mound with a columnar log three feet long and one foot wide. It&rsquo;s on a hill.</p>
<p>Taoist Cangsong gazed at the old log silently, without speaking. He just flashed a strange light in his eyes. After a while, he would come forward without saying a word. But at this moment, suddenly the Golden Vase son called out behind him: &ldquo;Taoist priest, wait a minute.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Cangsong Taoist turned to look at the Golden Vase and said, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please let me have a look around,&rdquo; said the Golden Vase.</p>
<p>Cangsong Taoist was stunned and did not speak, but the Golden Vase looked up. Turn your body slowly. Although it is already at the height of Longshou peak, the dangerous place of Longshou peak is still towering, which is much higher than here, and more than one place.</p>
<p>Standing in the middle of the pit, Jin Ping&rsquo;er can see that there are peaks on the East, North and west sides. From the bottom of the pit, the steep mountain seems to be inclined a little bit, like three fingers trying to close together, and his own pit is in the center. Now the night is low. The sky is like ink, and the Golden Vase looks like a long time. It feels like the sky is falling and dizzy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that she is not human after all. After taking back her eyes and calming her mind. He looked as usual, but there was a little relief on his face. Then he swept his eyes towards the pit. Suddenly, his body seemed to be lifted by the light wind and floated up, but he landed on the three foot log. Then he looked around again.</p>
<p>The Taoist Cangsong, standing on one side, frowned slightly, but his eyes were already faintly appreciative.</p>
<p>A moment later, the Golden Vase gave a long breath and said, &ldquo;good mind, good vision. This is the holy cave that the ancestor of Qingyun gate has taken a fancy to. It is really unique in God&rsquo;s eyes. There are three peaks gathered here to prevent the outflow. However, the most powerful thing is that this one thousand year old dark wood looks blunt and has no edge, but it just pierces into the weakest point of the spirit acupoint, such as beating a snake Seven inches, born with the dry and astringent air of dark wood, and subdued the aura of the whole mountain. It&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>She applauded, but from the heart. Taoist Cangsong looked at her, and his face softened unconsciously. After a moment, he said faintly: &ldquo;observing the weather of the mountain, it is qingyunzi, the founder of Qingyun sect who discovered this cave. As for the prohibition of dark wood under the cloth, the elder has no record. Some say that it is the founder of qingyunzi, and some say that it is the founder of Zhuxian sword array.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Jin Ping&rsquo;er nodded and said, &ldquo;in fact, I didn&rsquo;t like Qingyun gate in the past, but when I saw you today, I feel that there are many amazing and brilliant people among your ancestors. I am far behind. It seems that there is no lack of merit under your reputation.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Cangsong Taoist priest snorted, his face was proud, and said: &ldquo;Qingyun gate is thousands of years old, how can it be compared with other small sects? As for my ancestors of Qingyun, it is natural that it is&hellip;&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In the middle of the speech, his voice suddenly dropped, and at the end of the day, a sentence became hoarse and inaudible.</p>
<p>The Golden Vase son quietly jumped down from the thousand year old dark wood. Somehow, he felt a little sad in his heart. He didn&rsquo;t want to see Taoist Cangsong&rsquo;s face at the moment.</p>
<p>Is this person who is deeply proud of Qingyun, the first culprit to betray Qingyun?.</p>
<p>A person, is not a simple sentence &ldquo;good and evil&rdquo; can be described?.</p>
<p>In the pit, there was silence for a moment. Taoist Cangsong&rsquo;s body looked straight from behind, and still looked tall. However, his expression seemed to be hidden in the silence and shadow, which was not true.</p>
<p>After a long time, Taoist Cangsong&rsquo;s voice was low and said slowly, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve been delayed for a long time. Let&rsquo;s start.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The Golden Vase son nodded and said, &ldquo;tell me what to do.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>As the mountain wind blows, the thick trees around him sway with the wind, and the night is low. Only the sound of the deep pit is heard. It lasts for a long time. Suddenly, it stops for two times. After a while, only a dull sound is heard. However, something is thrown out of the pit and falls heavily on the path beside the pit.</p>
<p>Under the faint starlight, it is the thousand year old dark wood!.</p>
<p>After a while, the lapel moved, and the Golden Vase and Cang song Taoist priest jumped up together. With their Taoist deeds, they seemed to be tired. Obviously, it was not easy to change the spirit acupoint Qi.</p>
<p>Jin pinger gasped for a moment, frowned and asked Taoist Cang song, &ldquo;since we are here to destroy the lock of heaven, we only want to see if something happens in the future. Qingyun gate can no longer use the Qi pulse mountain spirit to help kill the immortal sword array. Then it&rsquo;s OK to pull out the thousand year old dark wood. Why do we have to change the place where the Qi pulse converges? Isn&rsquo;t it unnecessary.</p>
<p>Taoist Cangsong shook his head and said, &ldquo;Qingyun Mountain is a blessed place in the world. It is just like this that the founder of qingyunzi valued this place. Just pulling out the thousand year old dark wood is just to let the aura leak out. But first of all, the aura is very abundant here. Secondly, you can see that there are still three peaks gathering outside, which makes it even more difficult for the aura to leak out. Only by changing the place where the aura converges, leaving the place where the aura converges, can the three peaks, which are like iron buckets, gather together on this day, and then slowly disperse by virtue of the high mountain wind. In the future, there will be a sword array for killing immortals. Although the spirit of dragon head peak is still vigorous, it is scattered all over the mountain and can not be condensed. There is nothing he can do about it. &ldquo;.</p>
<p>Jin Ping&rsquo;er woke up and nodded to say yes, and then asked, &ldquo;what about the lock of the dragon head peak&rsquo;s Tianji has been destroyed? What about the other six veins?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Taoist Cangsong pondered for a moment, shook his head, and said, &ldquo;at most, we can only destroy the remaining three veins of Luoxia peak, Fenghui peak and Chaoyang peak. As for Tongtian peak, Dazhu peak and Xiaozhu peak, there is nothing we can do about it.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The Gold Vase son is curious and says: &ldquo;but why is this?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Taoist Cangsong said: &ldquo;tongtianfeng is the main pulse of Qingyun, and the defense is the most strict. The aura alone is very important. When zhuxianjian array was launched, it always focused on the aura of tongtianfeng, supplemented by the aura of six meridians. The so-called moving the whole body by pulling one hair, my elder martial brother daoxuan, who has a profound Taoist practice, can&rsquo;t move as long as there are some changes.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>He paused for a moment and then said, &ldquo;I know the location of the lock of the three meridians of Luoxia peak, fenghuifeng peak and Chaoyang peak. I don&rsquo;t know the location of the Tianji lock for the second pulse of dazhufeng and xiaozhufeng.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why is this?&rdquo; said the Golden Vase.</p>
<p>Cangsong Taoist priest was silent for a moment and said: &ldquo;Xiaozhu peak has always accepted female disciples, and the first water moon has a strong temper, so no one is allowed to go into the mountain, let alone the heaven&rsquo;s Secret lock. As for Dazhu peak, I&rsquo;ve always been close to Tian Buyi and Su Ru&rsquo;s husband and wife. Tian Buyi is also a proud man. There are not many disciples in Xiaozhu peak and they are not good at it, but they are also hidden It&rsquo;s hidden from the public. &ldquo;.</p>
<p>Jin pinger was amused, but then she frowned and said, &ldquo;well, we only broke the four pulse Tianji lock. Will it be less?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Taoist Cangsong shook his head and said, &ldquo;otherwise, as far as I know, as long as more than half of the seven channels of Qingyun have an accident, the Tianji lock will be useless. Because the aura of the main peak Tongtian peak is too strong, and even has the intention of killing and cutting, we have to balance the other six meridians to do the method. It&rsquo;s OK to say that if we lose four auras at the same time, I&rsquo;m afraid that Whether the Zhuxian sword array can be sacrificed or not is questionable. &ldquo;.</p>
<p>The Golden Vase son looked up and down carefully at the Taoist Cangsong, and suddenly said with a smile, &ldquo;Taoist priest, you are really far sighted. I&rsquo;m afraid that these things are not one day or two days in your heart.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The Taoist Cangsong&rsquo;s face sank, and he looked at the Golden Vase, but he was still smiling. He didn&rsquo;t mean to avoid his eyes. A moment later, it was Cangsong Taoist who first moved his eyes, said nothing, and turned away from the pit.</p>
<p>Jin pinger withdrew her eyes and fell at her feet. She saw the thousand year old Xuanmu lying on the side of the path quietly. With a smile, she stretched out her feet and kicked the dark wood into the weeds. Then she walked towards the direction where the Taoist priest Cangsong left.</p>
<p>Behind her, the mysterious and mysterious pit still seemed to be an ordinary one as usual. (to be continued. )</p>
