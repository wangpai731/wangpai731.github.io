      <p>Ghost Li left the dead porpoise in the corner of the wall, and looked at the hole where the porpoise was. As expected, a very thin line was drawn out of the hole and connected to a bell in the distance. I think he and jinpinger have repeatedly failed to infiltrate in the past few days. They were all found by this little grey dolphin.</p>
<p>He once read and recorded in the fragmented script &ldquo;different spirits&rdquo; in the secret collection of the ghost King School. The grey dolphin&rsquo;s nose is extremely sensitive, far superior to the world&rsquo;s ordinary things. He tried his best to cover his body shape these days, but he didn&rsquo;t expect to be found by this small beast.</p>
<p>Just though I want to understand this joint, but the fierce brow is also immediately wrinkled, standing in the dark corner of the corner of the wall, for a while, I pondered. Although the grey porpoise is not an ancient beast, it&rsquo;s rare in the world. It&rsquo;s only heard that it&rsquo;s found in a forest somewhere deep in the 100000 mountains of Southern Xinjiang. There is this beast in the burning incense valley. In recent days, I have tried to enter the burning incense valley from many places, but without exception, it seems that the number of porpoises in the burning incense Valley is quite large, which is surprising.</p>
<p>But the most important thing is to domesticate these grey dolphins at the same time to such an extent. This kind of animal control skill, not to mention the middle way, is unheard of in the demon sect, but it is said that there are some such skills among the barbarians in the south of Xinjiang!</p>
<p>The ghost raised his eyes and turned around. Looking forward, he suddenly found that, in the noise in the distance, the deep place of the burning incense valley was still peaceful, and the darkness covered it like a black curtain, and he did not know how many secrets were hidden.</p>
<p>The noise at the entrance of the valley gradually calmed down. Only someone was heard talking loudly from afar, but the fighting sound had all disappeared. It seems that the burning incense valley side has gradually controlled the situation.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know who it is, dare to challenge the burning incense valley so openly? Looking back at the entrance of the valley, ghost Li unconsciously passes the figure of Jin Ping&rsquo;er. This mysterious and charming woman is still in the chaos at the moment!</p>
<p>At this moment, GUI Li has gone from the invisible corner to the inside of the burning incense valley. Along the way, there is no alarm ring caused by the grey porpoise. It is thought that the incense Valley mostly distributes these small animals with keen sense of smell in all corners of the valley. Once in the middle of the valley, you don&rsquo;t have to worry about it.</p>
<p>The night was deep, and the valley, which had just calmed down from the noise, was very deep. With the ghostly figure floating on the path of the pavilion in the valley, the world under the black curtain gradually emerged.</p>
<p>Burning incense Valley is known as the pillar of the world. Although they usually act in a low-key way, they are big schools that have flourished for 800 years after all. What gradually emerges along the way is the essence of the valve.</p>
<p>Under the night, only a dozen paths are seen, big or small. They are connected with each other, like the blood of human body, and disperse to the darkness deep in the burning valley. On both sides of the road, there are ordinary disciples&rsquo; residences, or tall and majestic halls. Most of them are flowers, plants and trees. There are green bamboo, cold plum and bright peony and peony. They are in groups and far away from each other. It is integrated with the surrounding halls, but it has its own flavor.</p>
<p>Because of the noise, although it was in the late night, there were still disciples of the burning incense valley walking around here from time to time, and they had to be careful to hide their body shape so as not to expose their whereabouts. It seems that the faces of these disciples are calm. Without the surprise and vibration at the beginning of the noise, we know that the situation at the entrance of the valley has been settled.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard for these disciples of incense burning Valley to walk around. In the past ten years, he has cultivated the Dharma of Buddhism, magic and Taoism, which is based on the strange and magical Tianshu. The radical speed of Taoism is unimaginable. Even the knowledgeable ghost king is surprised. He can&rsquo;t understand it. In the end, it can only be attributed to the principle of the same practice of Buddhism and Taoism. Maybe there&rsquo;s a mystery in it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that Gui Li is hiding in the dark. Although he doesn&rsquo;t put these ordinary disciples of the burning incense Valley in his eyes, he has a headache over the dozens of roads in front of him. He doesn&rsquo;t know where to go. This time, he sneaked into the burning incense Valley secretly. With his own intention, he wanted to explore the secrets in the burning incense valley. It&rsquo;s better to find out the relationship with those Southern barbarians.</p>
<p>To know this, it is necessary to go to the places where the important people in the burning incense valley are. But these paths are like a maze, which is really a headache.</p>
<p>When ghost Li frowned and thought about whether he wanted to catch a disciple of burning incense Valley to torture, suddenly there was a movement on his shoulder and a slight * * of ash came from his ear.</p>
<p>The ghost Li was startled, turned to look, could not help but one of the body shock. I saw little grey monkey holding his clothes tightly with his hands. His face was twisted and his eyes were closed. He seemed to be suffering. But he was intelligent and human. He knew that this was not the right time, so he had to bear it.</p>
<p>The surprise of ghost and Li is quite extraordinary. Somehow, since just entering the valley, Xiaohui seems to have something wrong. At the moment, it seems that it has some great physical pain.</p>
<p>He put out his hand and gently held the ash down. He looked at it carefully. He only felt that the monkey was trembling slightly in his palm. Obviously, he was trying his best to resist the unknown pain. Ghost Li heart is more worried, low voice way: &ldquo;what&rsquo;s up, small ash?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As if because of hearing the master&rsquo;s words, the little gray head was askew and slowly opened his eyes.</p>
<p>The golden light is dark red, like the ghost fire in the night, more like the strange pupil under the nine hell, appears in front of the ghost.</p>
<p>The surrounding temperature seems to have suddenly cooled down.</p>
<p>Little gray&rsquo;s breathing sound began to increase slowly, and he could feel it clearly. He grasped the monkey&rsquo;s paws in his hands, which were getting stronger and stronger, and the paws were deep into the muscles.</p>
<p>The monkey&rsquo;s mouth slowly closed one by one, but the strange golden demon awn in its eyes was staring at the ghost, never relaxing for a moment. From there, the ghost suddenly felt a familiar, blood eating vision that was the same as before when he was crazy</p>
<p>In an instant, ghost Li suddenly felt cold all over his body. He turned around and looked at himself. In that sleeve robe, I don&rsquo;t know when to start. The blood bead on the top of the soul devouring gives off a faint green light with blood light.</p>
<p>Bloodshot!</p>
<p>The most vicious and evil thing in the world is so strange</p>
<p>It seems that he suddenly came out of his deep heart. In a moment, he felt a bitter taste in his mouth. He turned around and looked at Xiaohui. Little grey seemed to feel something too, and called twice in a low voice.</p>
<p>The ghost firmly fixed his mind, and then found that there was a sense of panic behind the golden awn in Xiaohui&rsquo;s eyes. He took a deep breath, then a smile appeared on the corner of his mouth, and said softly, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s OK.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohui seems to understand the master&rsquo;s words. The eyes blinked, slowly closed, a moment later, as if the inexplicable pain gradually subsided. The power on the little gray paw is also gradually decreasing.</p>
<p>Ghost Li stands in the dark and slowly holds the ash in his arms.</p>
<p>The night was as cold as water.</p>
<p>In front of us is a darkness. The figure of one man and one monkey flickers gently in the dark corner of the night.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how long I have been standing. Xiaohui seems to be asleep. Quietly in the arms of the ghost. GUI Li doesn&rsquo;t care that this is the dangerous place of burning incense valley. He stands in the dark and holds the monkey gently.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the little gray body in his arms moved and his head was raised.</p>
<p>Ghost Li looked down, only to see that the golden awn in monkey&rsquo;s eyes had disappeared, and it had changed into a nimble and lively appearance.</p>
<p>Ghost Li&rsquo;s heart was wide, but before he could say anything, Xiaohui seemed to struggle for a moment, and then pointed to the road outside. A ghost and a sharp stare. Looking up, after a while, sure enough, two people came from that road, but they were the people recognized by Gui Li.</p>
<p>Li Xun and Yan Hong.</p>
<p>Ghost Li eyebrow a wrinkle, these two people he already knew ten years ago, are extremely outstanding talents. Although the world has changed in the past ten years and we will not see each other again, the people who cultivate the truth, ten years is just like a moment. His behavior as like as two peas two years ago is almost the same as that of ten years ago, but they are watching their movements. Taoism is not comparable in those days.</p>
<p>I saw the two of them coming slowly, and they seemed to be talking to each other. When I got close, I only heard Yan Hong say, &ldquo;elder martial brother, why did those monsters rush in all of a sudden?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li Xun frowned. Obviously, I don&rsquo;t understand. But look at his face cold, cold way: &ldquo;those uncivilized animals, who can know what they are thinking! If I say that these fishermen dare to invade the valley, I will tell them that they will never return. Why bother uncle Shangguan again? &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be angry, elder martial brother,&rdquo; said Yan Hongrou. The valley master has foresight. There must be something we can&rsquo;t know for the time being. At the beginning of the negotiation with these barbarians, it was the martial uncle Shangguan who used his magic power to frighten at one stroke. Those barbarians regarded his old man as a man of heaven. As long as his old man appeared, those monsters would leave obediently. The valley master asked us to invite martial uncle Shangguan out, which must be the reason. &quot;</p>
<p>Li Xun snorted and said, &ldquo;naturally I know these things, but I don&rsquo;t understand why we should be low-key to these monsters with the respect of our incense burning valley. Now I need to invite martial uncle Shangguan to come out. If it&rsquo;s spread out, won&rsquo;t our incense burning valley become the laughingstock of the world&rsquo;s justice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yan Hong said with a smile: &ldquo;elder martial brother, I think there are still some places available for these barbarians, so the valley master only tolerated them for three points. In the future&hellip; &quot; At this point, she suddenly stopped talking, but looked at Li Xun with eyes, as if she had more words.</p>
<p>As soon as Li Xun&rsquo;s mouth was turned away, there seemed to be a trace of dissatisfaction on his handsome face. Looking from afar, he was more natural and unrestrained. But he didn&rsquo;t say anything more, just sighed, and Yan Hong slowly walked up the side of a path, after a while disappeared in the night.</p>
<p>In the shadow, a sharp look like a knife, looking at their backs.</p>
<p>Ghost Li&rsquo;s mind suddenly turned. It turned out that those fish people who violated the burning incense Valley tonight were the aliens they were after. Recalling the night three days ago, I heard Lv Shun talking with the fisherman in the dark. The tall fisherman seemed to be the leader of the family.</p>
<p>It seems that tonight&rsquo;s event is mostly due to the fact that the head of the fisherman clan was killed by jinpinger, and the rest of the fishermen came to revenge under the rage. As soon as he thought about it, he could not help passing the figure of jinpinger in his heart, and his vigilance to the woman was deeper.</p>
<p>He stood for a moment in the shadow, then seemed to make a decision and looked at the little ash in his arms. I saw little gray eyes blink, suddenly body move, jumped on his shoulder, grinned, it seems to have completely recovered.</p>
<p>The ghost Li put down his heart, smiled lightly and said: &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go to see what kind of guru is. How about that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohui &ldquo;squeaked&rdquo; twice, and with a wave of monkey&rsquo;s hand, it pointed to the road that Li Xun and Yan Hong went.</p>
<p>The ghost Li in the dark silent smile, the figure suddenly rises, fast as the ghost, to that secluded path up.</p>
<p>In the distance, a disciple of the burning incense Valley is coming here. Suddenly, he feels that there is a flower in front of him. It seems that there is a ghost on the road leading to the &ldquo;xuanhuotan&rdquo; in the middle of the valley. When he looks at it carefully, he sees nothing. He couldn&rsquo;t help but stare, then shook his head. Murmured a word, then continued to move forward, did not pay attention to this matter.</p>
<p>The path is quiet, but the road is unexpectedly long. It is obvious that the place where the martial uncle is located is very quiet. Ghost Li didn&rsquo;t go far on this road, and there would be no other houses around. There were trees, flowers and plants on both sides of the road. The night wind came, under the light of the moon in the sky. The shadow of the tree is whirling. It looks like a demon dancing around, revealing a bit of weird.</p>
<p>He walked along the path carefully for a long time, but didn&rsquo;t see any fork as he did outside. It seems that this road leads directly to the place where the senior martial uncle is.</p>
<p>Burning incense Valley covers a large area. This path leads to the deep valley.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a white square appeared in front of the road. As soon as his eyes were fixed, he saw a stone tablet with two lines of eight characters engraved on it</p>
<p>XuanHuo heavy ground</p>
<p>Disciple stop</p>
<p>The grimace frowned, not because the front might be burning incense Valley, but because the word &ldquo;XuanHuo&rdquo; quietly touched a place in his heart.</p>
<p>He can&rsquo;t help but look at his right arm. Under the clothes, &ldquo;xuanhuojian&rdquo; is lying on his arm.</p>
<p>He was stunned for a moment and then sneered. He walked past the stone tablet with his feet raised.</p>
<p>Although the stone tablet looks ordinary, it seems to be a boundary. After passing the stone tablet, I don&rsquo;t know how. Although the path is still winding forward, the trees and plants on both sides of the road are obviously scarce.</p>
<p>First, the grass on the ground gradually disappeared, then the low shrubs, and finally even the originally dense trees on both sides gradually became sparse. Do not say that the ground began to crack, that is, the remaining trees, the branches of the tree also turned yellow. However, it seems that there is an extreme lack of water nearby, and the land is scorched.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it has anything to do with the word &ldquo;XuanHuo&rdquo;?</p>
<p>The little grey on the shoulder called low, and the body moved, as if uneasy. Ghost Li lightly patted its body, small ash just gradually calmed down. At present, the scene around is really strange, but it doesn&rsquo;t look like what&rsquo;s important in the burning incense valley. Otherwise, even a guard disciple hasn&rsquo;t seen it along the way.</p>
<p>The ghost Li in the mind turns the thought, along the path, turned the last bend.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, Dingli even couldn&rsquo;t help being shocked. In front of him was a large open space. A heat wave came from nowhere.</p>
<p>There is a huge circular altar in the center of the open space. The bottom of the altar is hanging in the air. Thirteen huge pillars made of white jade, up to three feet high, support the whole altar. Among them, there are twelve white jade pillars on the edge of the altar, each of which has the thickness of two people holding together. However, it takes at least five or six people to hold the largest white jade pillar in the middle of the altar.</p>
<p>Above the altar, all the buildings are made of a kind of red and strange stone, including steps and railings. In the center of the altar stands a tall and majestic hall, showing the shape of a pagoda. There are three floors in total. Each floor is about half smaller than the next, but each floor is almost ten feet high.</p>
<p>Looking from afar, this altar is just a huge red flame burning directly into the sky. Ghost Li stands under this altar, almost like a ant, very small.</p>
<p>The building in front of me is really amazing. I&rsquo;m afraid it deserves to be put here. I didn&rsquo;t think there was such a magnificent building in the burning incense valley.</p>
<p>He thought for a moment about the stone tablet that had just come in. He knew vaguely that in front of him was the XuanHuo altar, the famous place in the burning incense valley.</p>
<p>He fixed his mind and then drifted away quietly. Except for the XuanHuo altar in front of us, it is an empty space without any cover. Fortunately, there was no guard around. He was so fast that he came to the bottom of XuanHuo altar in a flash.</p>
<p>As soon as I got close to the XuanHuo altar, the heat in the air suddenly increased several times. Even though I was practicing like a ghost, I felt a bit upset and sweat on my forehead. The ghost Li frowned and was surprised. Then he remembered that he didn&rsquo;t know if the ash could support the heat. He turned around and saw that the ash on his shoulder scratched his head and grabbed his ear. He seemed to ignore the heat around him.</p>
<p>Suddenly, he felt that Xiaohui was very unusual recently, especially after swallowing the miraculous medicine and stone in the treasure house of the God tree in the death swamp, his body began to change gradually.</p>
<p>However, in the current situation, it&rsquo;s better for Xiaohui not to be afraid of heat than for him to be afraid of it. For the time being, Guili has no mind to deal with so much. He was wondering if he would take the XuanHuo altar next. Suddenly, there was a sound of footsteps coming from above the XuanHuo altar.</p>
<p>With a frown on his brow, GUI Li glanced at the surrounding area, but saw that there was no shelter around him. In a minute of meditation, he flew under the XuanHuo altar and hid behind a large white jade pillar.</p>
<p>He hid behind the stone pillar, subconsciously reached out to touch it, and suddenly his hand was hot. How quickly he reacted, he immediately retracted his hand.</p>
<p>Under the XuanHuo altar, even the stone pillars were boiling hot.</p>
<p>The footsteps were loud, obviously someone came down. Suddenly, an old voice said slowly: &ldquo;since the valley master asked me, I will go. But you tell me why all of a sudden those fishermen are so violent that they are going to attack the valley? &quot;</p>
<p>Guili hides in the shadow of the stone pillar and looks out. Li Xun and Yan Hong follow behind an old man in grey. They walk down respectfully. (to be continued. )</p>
