      <p>After the monster catastrophe, from north to south, we can see the bleak scenery everywhere. There is no smoke in thousands of miles, and there is no voice in a hundred villages. In the north, because the days of tea poisoning are short, it is better. The more we go south, the more serious the scene is.</p>
<p>Broken walls, towns, everywhere. Even in the open land beside the field, it is even more shocking to find the forest white bones from time to time. The wind and smoke are bleak and bleak. The worldly world has one after another. If people are grass ants, they can&rsquo;t control their own destiny.</p>
<p>Many of the people who fled to the North began to slowly return home after confirming that the catastrophe had indeed retreated. Infinite desolate land, slowly began to have the popularity. However, in this scene, there is still a lot of sad atmosphere. On both sides of the road, there are still corpses falling to the ground. Some of them were killed by animal demons, while others, after the disaster, were hungry and cold on their way back home, and they were forced to leave their hometown. In between, occasionally a few remote places, there are still a small number of animal demons, from time to time there are rumors of animal demons harming people. But at this time, after all, it is the general trend. Although the small group of monster is still frightening, it has been unable to stop more people from returning home.</p>
<p>And even these lingering demons, in fact, soon disappeared. Because among the countless people who returned to their hometown, there were many disciples of the orthodox school. Once the animal demon harmed people from any place, they were soon subdued by these righteous disciples.</p>
<p>In the Qingyun battle, the beast God was defeated by the ancient sword of killing immortals, but he was not killed on the spot. The people in the right path are not fools. As the demon sect knows, he will surely understand the truth of &ldquo;eliminating evil and killing the root&rdquo;!</p>
<p>Therefore, many orthodox sects send their proud disciples one after another, and some small sects even pour out their nests. If they have the chance to capture the beast God and look around the world, it will be a credit and reputation. Is it leisure? What&rsquo;s more, the beast God is an immortal demon. If you want to say that there is no unique magic weapon around, even a fool will not believe it.</p>
<p>This kind of speculation is mixed in the flow of people. The general spread of the tide, toward the south, the world gradually peaceful behind, but as if there are countless people holding their breath. In contrast, it is the common people&rsquo;s pain. Few people care.</p>
<p>With the tide of people returning to the south, Zhou Yixian, Xiao Huan and wild dog Taoist, who are trudging among the crowd, feel different from others.</p>
<p>Monday immortal still held the bamboo pole in his hand. On it was the white cloth with the words &ldquo;immortal guiding the way&rdquo;. It was just white. In this year of chaos, it was even black and yellow. At first glance, there were several holes. Although the cool wind blows, the cloth banner is still blowing in the wind, but it is no longer half immortal. And it&rsquo;s all the fall of air.</p>
<p>As for the wild dog Taoist, for such a long time, or has been following in the Monday fairy and the small ring, three people roam the world together. However, at the moment, he wrapped his face with a piece of cloth, for nothing else. At this time, all the people around him were allergic to the slightly odd looking characters. If he was not careful, most people would be misunderstood as a member of the beast demon, which would be too unjust. After experiencing several such misunderstandings, don&rsquo;t try to persuade yourself. The wild dog Taoist couldn&rsquo;t stand it. He found a cloth to surround his face.</p>
<p>Among the three, Xiaohuan looks the most refreshing, original. Young and beautiful girls are naturally attractive and attractive. She seemed to be the most beautiful figure in the sea of grief and loss.</p>
<p>Along the way, different from the people around her, she often kept a smile, but it was not that kind of schadenfreude. On the contrary, she has been ignoring the incessant advice of Monday immortal, and has been doing her best to help those helpless people around her.</p>
<p>Some people are tired and fall, she comes forward to help them up; some people are hungry and cold, she gives them food and clothing; or if they are sick and weak, she seems to have a few medical skills and come to visit them; even when she sees a corpse lying on the road, she will walk gently in silence, not avoiding the stench, burying them roughly, which is a kind of comfort.</p>
<p>All the way, she was dusty. In addition to the solemn face of the sick and the weak, Xiao Huan seemed to always have a smile on her face. On such a dark road, she seemed to be a kind of celestial being. Zhou Yixian is still always nagging in a low voice, while Taoist yegou has never dissuaded Xiaohuan from saying anything. He just wants to do what Xiaohuan wants to do first: bury the corpse and dig the pit; rescue the weak, he is the victim himself. Along the way, his eyes, as if only the figure of that beautiful girl, what Xiaohuan does, he will do, even though the years of hard journey again tired, as if he did not care.</p>
<p>However, they are not immortals after all. There are so many hungry and cold people, and there is only a little food, even they soon have no more.</p>
<p>Forced to leave the team for the time being, they went to the mountains in the hope of finding something to eat in the forest.</p>
<p>Under the catastrophe, the situation is so miserable!</p>
<p>Monday fairy held the bamboo pole in his hand, looked at the gradually dim sky, shook his head, and sighed: &ldquo;this year, it&rsquo;s really impossible for people to live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan walked by his side, smiling and silent. However, this short period of time, although her face has a light wind dust color, but still beautiful as before, which also has a bit more mature than in the past. The wild dog Taoist followed her. The tall shadow and the slender figure of Xiao Huan overlapped together. His face wrapped in cloth curtain could not see anything, only his eyes were shining.</p>
<p>At the moment, they were quite far away from the main road and were on a small hill. The night was overcast. There were only a few stars in the distance, but no moon. The surrounding mountains are silent at the moment, and only the sound of insects coming from unknown places, for a long time or a short time, I don&rsquo;t know where.</p>
<p>Little Huan stopped, as if thinking of something, turned his head and said with a smile to the wild dog Taoist: &ldquo;Taoist priest, now that there are no outsiders, you can take off the cloth on your face and wrap it up for a whole day. I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ll feel bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wild dog Taoist priest&rsquo;s eyes flashed in the dark night, slowly took off the cloth curtain on his face, revealed his strange face, and said in a low voice: &ldquo;Er, actually I&rsquo;m ok, but you&rsquo;ve been busy for another day, are you tired?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhou Yixian also stopped and looked around. He saw a dead tree lying down beside him. He hurriedly walked over and sat down on it. Then he made a lazy waist like a sigh of relief from the bottom of his heart, and then he took a look at the small ring. &ldquo;Yes, she was busy, but she was merciful, so she gave her grandfather&rsquo;s dry food to others. Now even your grandfather is starving. &quot;</p>
<p>Xiao Huan, with a red face, came over and stood behind him. He stretched out his hands and beat him gently on his shoulder. He said, &ldquo;Grandpa, we are OK. But look at those people. If you don&rsquo;t eat anything, you will have no strength to go down. I&rsquo;m afraid you will die. &quot;</p>
<p>The wild dog Taoist looked to the left and right and said, &ldquo;sit down here. I&rsquo;ll go to the woods to see if I can catch some wild animals and satisfy my hunger for the time being.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Huan smiles at the dog Taoist and says, &ldquo;OK, thank you</p>
<p>The wild dog Taoist opened his mouth and began to laugh. Monday immortal suddenly snorted and sneered: &ldquo;what are you laughing at? And laugh.</p>
<p>But I see how you smile so obscene. Is it possible that you are thinking of some evil idea</p>
<p>The wild dog Taoist priest was startled. He quickly put away his smile and looked at Xiaohuan. He saw that Xiaohuan looked at him apologetically. His eyes were bright and there was no anger at all. He ignored him and read a sentence to Xiaohuan. Then you wait for me to come back Then he walked quickly into the woods.</p>
<p>Zhou Yixian murmured a few words, and Xiaohuan was slightly angry behind him: &ldquo;grandfather, that wild dog Taoist priest has been with us for so long. Why don&rsquo;t you give people a good look? Besides, he took care of us all the way, and he is not a bad man</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know what bad and good people are? He didn&rsquo;t follow us for the sake of &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grandfather Little ring gave a cry. Cut off Monday immortal&rsquo;s words. On Monday, Xianna complained and stopped talking.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>There was a whizzing sound in the woods, and then there was a fluttering sound. After a while, a burst of footsteps came quickly. The wild dog Taoist priest was very happy and ran out with a wild bird in the forest. A few days ago, after the animal demon catastrophe, all living things were covered with charcoal. In the past, these wild animals, mountain birds, seem to be much less than in the past. Today, we are still a wild dog Taoist. Fortunately, we caught a bird that missed the net!</p>
<p>The wild dog Taoist priest rushed back to his original place and said in a loud voice: &ldquo;you see, what have I caught?&rdquo; suddenly, his voice suddenly stopped. There was no one in the original open space. Neither the immortal nor the little ring disappeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;PATA&rdquo;, the wild bird fell from the dog Taoist&rsquo;s hand to the ground.</p>
<p>The night wind was cold, and the chill seemed to soak into the bone marrow in an instant. The body of Taoist wild dog was somehow shaking. Step by step, he stepped forward, the dead tree lying on the ground, and even the trace of Monday fairy just sat down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re gone, they&rsquo;re gone.&rdquo; the wild dog Taoist&rsquo;s mind was in chaos. A dog&rsquo;s face was changing, and he was afraid and sad. At the moment, the wild dog was dull, but a moment later, his body suddenly shook and his eyes brightened. However, he saw several messy footprints behind the dead wood. In the soft soil beside the footprints, there was a huge footprints twice the size of ordinary people. There were three teeth in the front, which were not owned by human beings.</p>
<p>The wild dog Taoist&rsquo;s face changed greatly. First he was very happy, then he was shocked. At this moment, he seemed to hear a long howl in the distance, and his voice was as shrill as a wolf barking at the moon. The wild dog Taoist couldn&rsquo;t help but step back, but after a moment, the muscles on his dog&rsquo;s face trembled slightly, and he suddenly roared. The whole man rushed into the howling place in the deep forest, and looked like a mad dog.</p>
<p>A crazy dog!</p>
<p>When the wild dog Taoist priest rushed into the dense forest, a white light suddenly appeared on the sky curtain of the dark sky. It galloped from the north, crossed the sky, broke through the sky, and flew to the south, like a meteor. On the ground, after a while, when the white light still remained in the sky, a dark shadow appeared not far from the open space just now. After a close look, he was covered in black, but he gasped slightly. He stopped in the forest and said to himself:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could he be so progressive in his way of life? It&rsquo;s a ghost.&rdquo; Just as he was resting, he suddenly seemed to feel something. He turned his head and looked into the deep forest. He only heard the voice of fighting from the deep forest. The man in black hesitated for a moment, then looked up at the white light in the sky, shook his head and sighed. Then the body flashed, but gently like a ghost, flashed into the direction where the wild dog Taoist rushed in just now.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>The wild dog Taoist priest&rsquo;s fangs magic weapon is in his hand, and his face is tense. Only for a moment, his shoulder is dark red, and it seems that he has already hung a lottery. But in front of him, there were two monsters with huge body. Tiger head and lion body, enough to a person to high, wild dog Taoist in front of them, look like it is vulnerable to a blow.</p>
<p>At the moment, the immortal and the little ring are behind the two monsters. In this dense forest. The two monsters seemed to have made a nest in this remote place, where many branches and grass leaves were piled up in disorder, and the smell of smell came from them. But the most terrifying thing is that the remains of the dead are scattered here and there, except for Monday fairy and little ring. There were still seven or eight living people here, but if they were not unconscious, they would wake up skinny and frightened.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know where these two monsters captured many people, but from this we can imagine how tragic the monster was!</p>
<p>In the face of these two huge monsters, the wild dog Taoist is short of breath and alert. Just now he rushed to this place, Fang saw that Zhou Xian and Xiao Huan were really here. Before waiting for him to shout, they had already been attacked by two monsters. After the fight.</p>
<p>These two monsters were so extraordinary and powerful that they even scratched the shoulder of Taoist priest dingo. In spite of this, the wild dog Taoist is after all a monk. Different from ordinary people, he sacrificed magic weapons and wounded a demon in a panic. At the moment, the animal demon&rsquo;s front legs were covered with blood, which was obviously not easy.</p>
<p>But these two monsters look very fierce. Seeing the blood, not only did not shrink back, but also he was staring at the wild dog Taoist. He was just worried about his magic weapon for a moment. It&rsquo;s just a temporary confrontation. But the wild dog Taoist is in the heart secretly cries bitterly, just that fight, he knew in the heart, if one such beast demon, he may win miserably, two together. There is no doubt that he will die.</p>
<p>But he may be able to turn around and run away, but somehow, his eyes intentionally or unintentionally see the beast demon behind that pair of worried and afraid eyes, is unable to move feet to escape alone.</p>
<p>Some things, is it really can not escape?</p>
<p>The ferocious beast demon roared, and finally could not bear it and rushed over. Two dark shadows in the shadow of the wind, which is accompanied by the voice of small ring.</p>
<p>The wild dog Taoist priest&rsquo;s throat hair is dry, the legs tremble slightly, instinctively turns to want to run, but, just, his body, however, is to rush up, toward that fierce beast demon, as if——</p>
<p>Mad dog!</p>
<p>In an instant, the two monsters and four claws almost simultaneously grabbed the body of the wild dog Taoist, and the fangs of the Taoist priest were inserted into the chest of the beast demon who had just been injured.</p>
<p>The beast demon and the wild dog Taoist made a scream at the same time. Xiao Huan&rsquo;s exclamation has changed into a cry.</p>
<p>The blood spattered, and the wild dog Taoist felt that his whole body was about to split, as if his body had been torn in two, and he staggered back. In his panic, he saw only four blood holes on his body, and the fresh blood gushed out like a spring.</p>
<p>In front of him, the monster roared a few times, but he fell to the ground. The animal demon next to him moaned and did not care to chase down the wild dog Taoist. Instead, he kept moving his companions with his head and claws. But the wound of the demon was stabbed into the heart by fangs. After struggling for several times, his head fell to the ground and died.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pa&rdquo;, a light sound, but the wild dog Taoist finally did not support, knelt down on the ground, almost all his upper body was soaked in blood, a blood red, panting, the dog&rsquo;s face pale.</p>
<p>However, the sound startled the remaining demon. Seeing the death of his companion, the beast demon seemed to be more crazy, roared up to the sky, and its tusks were like blood, and rushed over again.</p>
<p>Seeing the wild dog Taoist was dying under the claws of the beast, all of a sudden, a yellow light flashed on the ground, and several pieces of Rune paper were flying. The wild dog Taoist was not seen, and the beast demon flew into the air.</p>
<p>The beast demon was frightened for a moment, but after a moment, he just heard the sound of &ldquo;ouch&rdquo;. The Taoist priest with blood all over his body fell down from the sky. He was still holding several amulets in his hand.</p>
<p>Naturally, it was Monday immortal who used his self claimed ancestral immortal methods. Just then, the beast demon attacked his grandparents and grandchildren. Suddenly, however, they had been arrested for a moment. Under the beast demon&rsquo;s big mouth, they had no chance to make a mistake. Fortunately, Taoist wild dog had a hot head and rushed to save people. There was only a moment&rsquo;s gap. Originally, he wanted to escape, but he didn&rsquo;t want him to die. However, he had no choice but to save people first.</p>
<p>However, his magic skills seemed to be just a little bit of work. Although some of them were similar to the Taoist &ldquo;Five ghosts moving house&rdquo;, they moved the wild dog Taoist out of thin air. However, they were only half of the way and lost their hands somehow. As a result, they fell out of the air and were in great confusion for a moment. Fortunately, the wild dog Taoist was on Monday immortal when he fell down. Otherwise, he would be killed.</p>
<p>But at the moment, they can&rsquo;t think of many of them. The beast demon found that, in a flash of anger, it was already coming again. On Monday, the immortal and the wild dog Taoist fell dizzy. The wild dog Taoist was better, but he was seriously injured and couldn&rsquo;t escape. However, they had to wait for death. On his dog&rsquo;s face, he stealthily passed a trace of perplexity and looked back, as if he wanted to see something?</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, at the moment of the electric light and flint, a figure suddenly rushed up and stood in front of the wild dog Taoist priest and the immortal on Monday. He only listened to the crowd shouting: &ldquo;grandfather Taoist priest&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beast demon ice cold claws under the sharp teeth, small ring that desperate cry but calm face!</p>
<p>In a flash, the wild dog Taoist priest only felt a stream of hot blood rushing to his head. His whole body was boiling like a boiling hot. He looked at the figure, the soft and beautiful shadow!</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boom</p>
<p>With a loud noise, the two figures collided.</p>
<p>Xiaohuan staggered to one side, covered with mud, but she did not pay attention to these. Looking back, she saw the wild dog Taoist who pushed her body away, jumped up, entangled with the demon and threw it on the ground. In his fury, the demon stretched out his claws and crazily scratched on the back of the wild dog Taoist priest. In an instant, his flesh and blood flew wildly. However, the wild dog Taoist priest hugged the beast demon with no intention of letting go.</p>
<p>Xiaohuan and Zhouxian are both pale at the moment, and behind them, everyone is scared to be silly. After a moment, suddenly, I don&rsquo;t know who is shouting. All the people who can walk around rush to the monster, and take up all the utensils in their hands. If not, they use their own hands, legs, feet and even teeth to greet the ferocious monster.</p>
<p>The beast demon began to roar and resist, but after a while, its voice gradually became smaller and deeper, and finally there was no sound. And the surrounding people seem to be crazy in general, has been trying to beat the demon body.</p>
<p>Until, Monday fairy is the first to wake up, quickly stop people, save people, the other people this slowly stopped. And this relaxed, in an instant, many people collapsed on the ground.</p>
<p>There were also some blood stains on the small ring, but she did not care. She tried her best to pull the beast demon corpse, trying to pull the wild dog Taoist from the animal demon body. Unexpectedly, after pulling for a long time, the beast demon and the wild dog Taoist could not be separated. Xiaohuan was frightened and anxious, and almost cried out.</p>
<p>Finally, it was Monday immortal. After careful inspection, it was found that it was the wild dog Taoist whose hands were pierced with the tough fur of the beast demon. It was no wonder that they could not be separated. After finding out this, Monday fairy quickly asked everyone to help. With the help of others, he finally took the bloody hands of Taoist wild dog out of the demon body and separated the two bodies.</p>
<p>Xiaohuanhua looks pale. She puts her body on the ground. She is about to ask. Suddenly, she looks pale. She puts her hand in front of the nose of the wild dog road. She is numb at the moment!</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is the master&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with him?&rdquo; he said in a hurry on Monday</p>
<p>Xiao Huan&rsquo;s lips trembled slightly, and tears filled his eyes. He cried in a trembling voice: &ldquo;Taoist priest, he has already died.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Monday fairy also froze for a while, numbly speechless.</p>
<p>In Xiaohuan&rsquo;s sobbing and choking voice, under the dim light in the dark, the wild dog Taoist priest&rsquo;s strange face was full of pain, but there was a faint twisted smile in the pain.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s dead, like a dead mad dog!</p>
