      <p>Chapter two.</p>
<p>Lingxizong, located in donglinzhou, is the downstream branch of Tongtian River. Based on the north and south sides of Tongtian River, lingxizong has a history of ten thousand years and has shocked all quarters.</p>
<p>Eight cloud shrouded Jingtian peaks lie across the Tongtian River, including four on the north bank and three on the south bank. As for the Tongtian River in the middle, there is a most majestic peak.</p>
<p>The mountain is covered with snow from the middle part of the mountain. It can&rsquo;t see the end clearly. Only the lower part of the mountain is hollowed out, making the golden river run through like a mountain bridge.</p>
<p>At this moment, outside the South Bank of lingxizong, a Changhong comes at a gallop. Li Qinghou, a middle-aged monk in lingxizong, with Bai Xiaochun, does not enter the area under the third peak. The screams of Bai Xiaochun in Changhong can be heard.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun felt that he was going to be scared to death. All the way, he saw countless mountains and felt that he could not grasp each other&rsquo;s thighs several times.</p>
<p>The flower in front of his eyes, when clear, had arrived outside an attic. After falling on the ground, his legs trembled and he looked around at the world completely different from that in the village.</p>
<p>In front of the attic, there is a big stone with three big characters written on it.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous service.</p>
<p>A pockmarked woman sat by the big stone. Seeing Li Qing waiting for her arrival, she immediately got up to see her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take this to the fire kitchen.&rdquo; Li Qinghou left a word, ignored Bai Xiaochun, turned to Changhong and went away.</p>
<p>The pockmarked woman was stunned when she heard the three words of huozaofang. She glanced at Bai Xiaochun, gave her a cloth bag for a family servant, and gave her an expressionless account. She took her out of the attic. There were numerous attics, bluestones, and the fragrance of flowers and plants. It was like a fairyland. Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s heart was rippling and her heart was less nervous and nervous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good place. It&rsquo;s much better than the village.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun looks forward to it. As he goes, the more forward he goes, the more beautiful the surrounding scenery becomes. Even he sees some beautiful women passing by from time to time, which makes Bai Xiaochun like it very much.</p>
<p>A moment later, Bai Xiaochun was more happy, especially at the end of the front. He saw a seven story attic with crystal clear, even cranes flying in the sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elder martial sister, are we here?&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun asked excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there it is.&rdquo; Pockmarked woman is still expressionless, light mouth, a point to the side of the path.</p>
<p>When Bai Xiaochun followed the direction of the other party and looked with expectation, the whole person froze, rubbed his eyes and looked carefully. On the path, the ground was broken in many places, and the surrounding was even dilapidated. Several cottages seemed to collapse at any time, and even some strange smell floated from there.</p>
<p>White small pure want to cry without tears, holding the last glimmer of hope, asked a pockmarked woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elder martial sister, you are wrong&hellip;&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No Ma face woman light mouth, first walk on this path, Bai Xiaochun after hearing, feel all beautiful moment collapse, bitter face followed the past.</p>
<p>Not far away, he saw several big black pots scurrying to and fro at the end of the shabby path. After a closer look, there was a fat man under each big black pot. He seemed to be full of fat. He seemed to be able to shed oil when squeezed. He was not so fat, especially the fattest guy in it. He was like a meat mountain. Bai Xiaochun was worried about whether it would explode.</p>
<p>Around the fat people, there are hundreds of big pots. These fat people are adding water and rice.</p>
<p>When he noticed that someone was coming, especially when he saw a woman with a pockmarked face, the meat mountain was immediately surprised. He carried a spoon and ran across the street. The ground trembled, and his fat body trembled with countless waves. Bai Xiaochun was stunned and subconsciously wanted to look for an axe around him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard magpie calling this morning. It turns out that you are my elder sister. Have you changed your mind and feel that I have some talent to make friends with me on this fine day.&rdquo; Meat mountain eyes in the dew excellent squint light, excited to run while shouting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send this son to your kitchen. I&rsquo;ve brought it here. Goodbye!&rdquo; After seeing the meat mountain, the pockmarked woman looks very ugly and still a little annoyed. She quickly retreats.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun took a breath. He noticed the pockmarked woman all the way. Her appearance was just fantastic. What&rsquo;s the taste of the fat man in front of him? He could even look like this.</p>
<p>Before Bai Xiaochun finished thinking about it, the meat mountain called out and appeared in front of him, directly covering the sun and covering Bai Xiaochun in the shadow.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun looked up at the huge fat man in front of him, whose flesh was still shaking. He tried to swallow his saliva. It was the first time he saw such a fat man.</p>
<p>Meat Hill full of resentment will look away from the direction of the distant Ma Lian woman left, swept the white eyes of small pure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho Ho, there&rsquo;s a new man. It&rsquo;s not easy to squeeze the arranged Xu Baocai down.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elder martial brother, I am I&rsquo;m Bai Xiaochun&hellip; &quot; Bai Xiaochun felt that the other side&rsquo;s big body made him under too much pressure and subconsciously stepped back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bai Xiaochun? Well The skin is white, small and exquisite, and the appearance is very pure. It&rsquo;s not bad. Your name is very suitable for my taste As soon as meat Hill&rsquo;s eyes brightened, he patted down Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s shoulder and almost knocked him down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun took a breath and rolled her eyes. She looked at the meat mountain with disdain. She thought about playing with each other&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name is Zhang daphou. That&rsquo;s Huang Er Pang and Hei San Pang&hellip;&rdquo; Meat mountain, hey, hey, smile.</p>
<p>When Bai Xiaochun heard these names, she was deeply moved and immediately lost the idea of playing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As for you, you will be called Bai Jiu Younger martial brother, you are too thin! If you go out like this, you will lose the face of our huozaofang, but it doesn&rsquo;t matter. Don&rsquo;t worry, you will be fat for a year at most. In the future, you will be called Bai jiupang. &quot; Zhang Da Pang patted his chest, and his fat was shaking.</p>
<p>Hear white nine fat these three words, white small pure face all squeeze out bitter water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since you are the ninth younger martial brother, you are not an outsider. We have a tradition of carrying a pot in the kitchen. You can see the pot behind me. It is the king of the pot. It is made of iron and engraved with ground fire array. The LingMi cooked in this pot tastes more than the ordinary one. You have to choose one, and then you will carry it on your body. That&rsquo;s the prestige. &quot; Zhang daphou patted the big black pot behind his back and boasted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elder martial brother, can I forget about carrying the pot&hellip;&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun takes aim at the pot behind Zhang Da Pang. All of a sudden, people in the kitchen room feel like they are carrying the pot. He thinks about how he carries a big black pot and says quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can we do that? It&rsquo;s our tradition to carry the pot. When you are in the family, others will not dare to bully you if they see you carrying the pot and know that you are a member of the fire kitchen. We have a great future in the fire kitchen!&rdquo; Zhang daphou winked at Bai Xiaochun. He could not help but carried Bai Xiaochun to the back of the thatched cottage. There were thousands of large pots stacked there. Most of them had a thick layer of ash. Obviously, no one came here for a long time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ninth younger martial brother, you choose one. We&rsquo;ll cook. Otherwise, the rice will be burnt and the disciples of other schools will shout again.&rdquo; Zhang daphou called out, turned around with other fat men, and began to run around the hundreds of pots.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun sighed and looked at the pot. As he was trying to decide which one to choose, he suddenly saw a pot under pressure in the corner.</p>
<p>This pot is special, not round, but oval. It doesn&rsquo;t look like a pot. Instead, it looks like a turtle shell. It seems that there are some dim lines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; When Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s eyes lit up, he quickly walked over, squatted down and looked at it carefully, then moved it out. After a careful look, his eyes showed satisfaction.</p>
<p>He liked tortoise since he was a child, because tortoise represents longevity, and the reason why he came to cultivate immortals is to live forever. Now he looks at the pot like a turtle shell. In his opinion, it is very auspicious and a good omen.</p>
<p>After moving the pot out, Zhang daphou saw it from a distance and ran over with a big spoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how many years ago you&rsquo;ve never used the turtle&rsquo;s shell, so you haven&rsquo;t used it on this person&rsquo;s back Are you sure? &quot; Zhang Da Pang patted himself on the stomach, good advice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, I&rsquo;ll take the pot.&rdquo; The more Bai Xiaochun looked at the pot, the more he liked it.</p>
<p>Zhang Da Pang persuades Bai Xiaochun again. Seeing that Bai Xiaochun insists on doing so, he looks at him strangely and stops talking about it. After arranging a thatched cottage for Bai Xiaochun to live in, he is busy again.</p>
<p>Now it is dusk. Bai Xiaochun looks at the turtle shaped pot carefully in the thatched cottage. He finds that there are dozens of lines on the back of the pot, but it is dim. If you don&rsquo;t look closely, it is difficult to find out.</p>
<p>He immediately thought that the pot was extraordinary and carefully placed it on the stove. Then he looked at the house where he lived. The house was very simple, with a small bed, a desk and chair, and a bronze mirror for daily use hung on the wall. When he looked around the room, there was a purple light on the plain pot behind him, which flashed away!.</p>
<p>For Bai Xiaochun, a lot of things happened on this day. Although he came to the fairy world he had always dreamed of, he was at a loss after all.</p>
<p>A moment later, he took a deep breath, with expectation in his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to live forever!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun sits aside and takes out the pocket given by the pockmarked woman at the worker&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>There is a pill, a wooden sword, a burning incense, the clothes and tokens of the servants, and finally a bamboo book with a few small characters on it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The skill of controlling tripod by Ziqi is the chapter of condensing gas.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>At dusk, when Zhang daphou and others are busy in the fire kitchen, Bai Xiaochun in the house looks at the bamboo book with expectation in his eyes. He comes here for longevity, and the gate of Changsheng is in his hand now. After taking a few deep breaths, Bai Xiaochun opens the bamboo book and reads it.</p>
<p>A moment later, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s eyes were full of excitement. There were three pictures on the bamboo book. According to the above statement, cultivation can be divided into two realms: condensation and foundation building. The purple gas controlling tripod skill is divided into ten layers, corresponding to the ten layers of condensate.</p>
<p>When you reach the third level, you can control objects with a weight of less than half a tripod. At the sixth level, you can control most of the tripods. At the Ninth level, you can control the objects with two tripods.</p>
<p>However, there are only the first three layers of skills in this bamboo book, and the rest are not recorded. If you want to practice, you need to follow specific breathing and movements to practice the purple Qi controlling Ding skill.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun got up and adjusted his breath. He closed his eyes and put out the action of the first picture on the bamboo book. After only three breaths, he gave a scream of pain all over his body. He couldn&rsquo;t hold on to it. Moreover, the way of breathing made him feel short of breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too difficult. It&rsquo;s said that in the first picture of cultivation, you can feel a trace of Qi in your body, but I don&rsquo;t feel anything here except suffering.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun was a little distressed, but in order to live long, he tried again, so stumbling, until the evening, he never felt the Qi in his body.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t know that it would take at least a month for a person with excellent aptitude to practice the first level of Ziqi controlling Ding skill without external force. However, he could not feel Qi at all when he was only here for a few hours.</p>
<p>At the moment, Bai Xiaochun stretched out and was about to wash her face. All of a sudden, there was a lot of noise outside the door. Bai Xiaochun put her head out of the window and immediately saw a young man with a pale face standing outside the door of the fire kitchen yard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who replaced my quota of Xu Baocai, get out of here!&rdquo;.</p>
