      <p>Under Qingyun Mountain.</p>
<p>The sky is high and the clouds are light. Standing at the foot of the mountain and looking up, you can see a piece of blue. The breeze is blowing slowly, which makes you feel refreshed.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi watched for a long time. Nobody was around. Naturally, no one would notice that there was such a beautiful woman watching the sky at the foot of the secluded mountain. When the breeze blows, her shawl hair flutters gently, passing her slightly thin face.</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue&rsquo;s instructions echoed in her ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the conversation between elder martial brother daoxuan and elder martial brother Wan, we know that all the masters of Qingyun sect would tell this secret to the next generation of disciples when they were still sober, and the fate handed down by the ancestors was for the sake of the reputation of Qingyun gate and the common people in the world. In order to avoid more murders, when it was absolutely necessary, the inheriting disciples could To kill a teacher&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For some reason, elder martial brother daoxuan didn&rsquo;t tell Xiao Yicai the secret. I think there are two reasons: first, before he made up his mind to tell Xiao Yicai the secret, he had already been bitten by the evil spirits of the ancient sword for killing immortals; second, because of his profound Taoism, especially in a fierce battle ten years ago, he used the sword array to kill immortals, but he didn&rsquo;t see his heart The devil is eating back, so I think it can resist the past this time. It will be too late when the real devil bites back. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just that despite the accident, as the children of Qingyun, we can&rsquo;t stay out of it. Tian is not easy to disappear. Younger martial sister Su is in a mess. I&rsquo;m the only one to make this decision. You don&rsquo;t have to take part in it. But if you find them at the foot of the mountain, you should take the responsibility with all your heart. If the ancestors of Qingyun have spirits, they will surely protect you, my teachers and disciples! &quot;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi slowly opened her eyes and took a deep breath.</p>
<p>She turned her head and looked at the towering mountains and rivers behind her, which were graceful and straight, and the distant mountains undulating with Dai. Close to see the crags abrupt, everywhere is the demeanor, in all for the scenery.</p>
<p>Towering into the clouds, the world is cut off.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s for Qingyun!</p>
<p>The corners of her mouth. Slowly emerged a faint and warm smile, this mountain, after all, is the place where she grew up. There are teachers she respects, close sisters and sisters, as well as the memory.</p>
<p>She turned.</p>
<p>Walking away, white clothes like snow, floating and moving, the sky is so big, the sky is infinite, even if it is a peerless face, heroes, perhaps just a drop in the ocean!</p>
<p>For the first time, he came down the mountain at the command of his teacher. There is no definite place to go. It&rsquo;s a bit ridiculous to think about where we should go to finish the task, although we are shouldering heavy responsibilities.</p>
<p>Tianya held it quietly in his hand, but he didn&rsquo;t feel familiar with it. It should be said that he had already become a part of his body. The light blue light was also converged in the scabbard. One man, one sword, walking.</p>
<p>Where should we go?</p>
<p>The world is so big!</p>
<p>In front of her is a fork in the road. Lu Xueqi stops, but it&rsquo;s not that she doesn&rsquo;t know the way. Among the disciples of Qingyun sect, she is the one who goes down the mountain more frequently. She has gone through a smooth road before her eyes for countless times. It is the most convenient way to the outside of Qingyun Mountain, directly leading to Heyang City, the largest town under Qingyun Mountain.</p>
<p>The other fork road, it seems that it has been abandoned for a long time, and weeds are growing everywhere. Only a section near the fork road can be seen, looking into the distance. Farther away, the grass had already drowned.</p>
<p>In fact, there are many such trails coming down from Qingyun Mountain. Many of them are from the villagers living in the villages near the foot of Qingyun Mountain. In order to make a living, they go up the mountain to cut firewood or pick wild fruits. There are also many roads. For various reasons, over time, they have become this kind of waste.</p>
<p>This road, who knows where to lead, and who will remember, who has ever walked?</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi shakes her head slightly and smiles bitterly in her heart. After returning from southern Xinjiang, she has been separated from that person. Her mood has really changed a lot.</p>
<p>She shook her head gently, and if she wanted to get rid of the idea, she would go back to the road. At this time, from the other side of the road came three or three villagers, old and young, looking at their clothes and clothes, mostly with axes, hemp ropes and shoulder poles. It seems that all of them were woodcutters who wanted to go up the mountain to cut firewood in the nearby villages.</p>
<p>When they got close, the woodcutters saw Lu Xueqi, and they all stood aside one by one with a look of respect on their faces. The disciples of Qingyun gate had been respected by people for hundreds of miles around here. Besides, Lu Xueqi was so beautiful that she could not be looked at.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi stopped, nodded slightly to them, as a salute, and then planned to leave.</p>
<p>At this moment, one of the old woodcutters, who looked gray but still hale and hearty, seemed to be very enthusiastic and said with a smile: &ldquo;girl, don&rsquo;t you know the way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s body slightly pauses, stops, her eyes flow, looks at the old woodcutter, hesitates for a moment, and gently shakes her head.</p>
<p>But before she could speak, the warm-hearted old woodcutter already said, &ldquo;I know that you Green Cloud Gate&rsquo;s immortal practitioners are very good. Many times you fly around, but the road under your feet is not familiar to us rural people sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Qiaofu, looking at the steps of Lu Qiaofu, suddenly stops and laughs.</p>
<p>The old woodcutter said with a smile, &ldquo;the road ahead of you leads to Heyang city in the south. It&rsquo;s the busiest place in a hundred miles nearby. It&rsquo;s much easier to go to other places when you get there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he pointed to the abandoned path and said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t go to that road. It was a busy village many years ago, but now it&rsquo;s destroyed and no one is there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi smiles and says, &ldquo;I see. Thank you very much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old woodcutter waved his hand and laughed twice. He and the others went on walking towards Qingyun Mountain.</p>
<p>At the same time, a woodcutter who was a little younger than him sighed and said, &ldquo;originally there was a temple in that village. I heard that it was very spiritual. My wife and I went there to worship Bodhisattvas and ask for children more than ten years ago. It turned out that it did, but now it&rsquo;s gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old woodcutter nodded and said, &ldquo;yes, I also remember. It&rsquo;s a pity that the temple is gone&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The voice of the words gradually lowered, and their figures gradually disappeared in the mountains and forests, in the light wind blowing in the distance. There seems to be their cheerful and straightforward laughter, Lu Xueqi turned around, the smile on her face is still there, I don&rsquo;t know how. Her mood seemed much better.</p>
<p>With a smile, she walked up to the road.</p>
<p>The pace was light, but somehow, her pace suddenly slowed down. Delicate eyebrows, slightly wrinkled, the bottom of my heart, as if suddenly swept by an important thing, but did not grasp.</p>
<p>Deep in the memory, it seems that there is something, quietly awakened</p>
<p>She stood still and did not move. What she had just seen was repeated quickly from her mind.</p>
<p>The woodcutter&rsquo;s words echoed again: &ldquo;don&rsquo;t go to that road. Many years ago, it was also a lively village, but now it&rsquo;s all destroyed and no one is there&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Originally, there was a temple in that village. I heard it was very clever&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi suddenly whole body a shock, a moment later, she slowly turned around, again. Look at that grass, as if has been annihilated in the years of the path</p>
<p>How many things can be changed in ten years? Face, mood, or hatred?</p>
<p>No one can understand others. Even sometimes, you can&rsquo;t really understand it. But this is the only way that has really changed.</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s no way out here.</p>
<p>Dense growth of weeds, year after year of growth, covered the past history, witnessed the merciless time. Until a white lonely figure. Quietly approached the dusty place.</p>
<p>Among the weeds, you can still see the broken walls. In the breeze blowing, there is no bloody smell, but the fragrance of the grass.</p>
<p>Through a broken door after another, looking at the zigzag, quietly covered by moss stone step walls, those who have had laughter and joy, have gone with the wind?</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s face, slightly pale, slender and delicate hand, also will Tianya grip more tightly. In this abandoned village, it seems that someone&rsquo;s eyes are quietly watching her. She even had a feeling that she couldn&rsquo;t breathe.</p>
<p>But she did not stop. She walked quietly through every house. Once upon a time, who remembered the people here?</p>
<p>Until she saw the ruined temple.</p>
<p>Different from the surrounding environment, there is no living grass around the dilapidated temple for some reason. It is a room rather than a few pillars. Only when it falls on the ground, and there are still three or two pieces of broken stones, and there are still some images of gods, we can see where it used to be.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi walked slowly past.</p>
<p>There are no weeds, no moss, everything here seems to be out of place with the surrounding, do not know what in the end, even so tenacious growth of weeds, do not want to enter here.</p>
<p>Or is it that all the resentments and resentments that once gathered in this place?</p>
<p>So in the dead of night, will someone cry and whisper and tell the past?</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi suddenly turned around. She didn&rsquo;t know when, but tears flashed in her eyes.</p>
<p>Caomiao village!</p>
<p>This long forgotten place</p>
<p>She sat quietly in the corner, motionless, as if listening or feeling something.</p>
<p>In the distance, there was a wind blowing, blowing her black hair, fluttering gently at the temples.</p>
<p>The sun rises and the moon falls, the morning and the evening, the stars change.</p>
<p>On the sky, white clouds are like Canggou, disappearing like meteors, and time is like water. After all, they are determined to go, never stay for anyone.</p>
<p>In the distance of the weeds, I do not know where the sound of insects, in addition to the wind, this is the most vibrant sound here. Maybe, in another ten years, this place will become a thriving place again?</p>
<p>Or, it&rsquo;s the same as before.</p>
<p>Who cares?</p>
<p>For three days, Lu Xueqi has been sitting quietly for three days in this remote place. The world is bound up with heavy responsibilities. However, it turns out that only in such a place can there be a place for breathing and escaping.</p>
<p>Quietly, when it is indulgence, let oneself hide.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that she has to go after all.</p>
<p>The white clothes swayed and came quietly. Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s figure reappeared. She left the dilapidated temple and walked through the door of a small house under the ruins. Somehow, her eyes looking at it seemed to have already contained the deep feeling of reluctant to give up.</p>
<p>In the distant sky, the clouds are floating, the clouds are faintly in the air, like being blown by the wind. A white line glides across the sky. Lu Xueqi finally took a look at these houses, turned and left, never looking back, the figure in white. Walk away quietly in the grass.</p>
<p>Above the sky, white clouds are still silent.</p>
<p>But from the clouds, suddenly swept out a fast glimmer, silent and fast, with a few strands of white clouds on the clouds. Spread out in the air. Soon, the light fell on the abandoned village.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cheep, cheep&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The familiar call of the monkey, the three eyed grey haired monkey jumped to the ground and looked around. Obviously, it was more pleasant to come to this wild place than in the belly of Huqi mountain.</p>
<p>After a while, the monkey jumped away and got into the thick grass. He didn&rsquo;t know where to play.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s terrible. Standing in the center of the village, silent.</p>
<p>In addition to the eyes, that can not hide the fatigue and pain.</p>
<p>He was staring at everything around him, slowly turned around, once familiar place, everything slowly appeared in his mind, and even the wind blowing from the distance had a trace of familiarity.</p>
<p>The fragrance of hometown land</p>
<p>And in the distance behind him, behind the dense grass, the white and slightly lonely figure. Finally disappeared in the distance.</p>
<p>He walked slowly, and the things that had caught Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s eyes also appeared in front of him, ruins, moss steps. Finally, it was the ruined temple.</p>
<p>But he didn&rsquo;t go there. He just looked at the small temple from a distance. He was dazed. It was there that changed a young man&rsquo;s life!</p>
<p>He stood for a long time. After a long time, he turned around, stepped on the weeds on the ground, and walked on the path that could barely distinguish the distance between the houses. He walked slowly, as if every step was heavy, until he stopped in front of the third room in the second row.</p>
<p>This is a house no different from other dilapidated houses. The same doors and windows fall off, the same desolation and abandonment. Even the moss on the stone steps seems to be more than other houses.</p>
<p>His sharp lips began to tremble gently. For the first time in many years, he could not restrain tears in his eyes. Slowly, he knelt down in front of the hut and buried his head in the ground and grass in front of the hut.</p>
<p>In the wind came a murmur of choking struggle: &ldquo;father, mother&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Heyang city.</p>
<p>After the beast demon catastrophe, Heyang city is greatly injured, and there are countless casualties, but after the disaster, the days always have to live. People from all sides of the ancient city gradually escaped.</p>
<p>On the busiest street, the best restaurant in Heyang city is still the shanhaiyuan where Zhang Xiaofan lived when he went down the mountain for the first time. Although the business seems to be much colder than ten years ago because of the disaster, it&rsquo;s hard for people to come here to eat and drink because of the disaster.</p>
<p>However, on this day, a strange guest came to Shanhai garden. This is a young woman. She looks beautiful and moving. It&rsquo;s OK. But under this beautiful face, there is a strange feeling of touching people&rsquo;s heart. It seems that as long as the woman&rsquo;s eyes are swept like water, the bones of men around him will be softened by three points.</p>
<p>The woman was Xiaobai, the Nine Tailed Tianhu who was lost with GUI Li and Lu Xueqi after the great change in southern Xinjiang.</p>
<p>She went into the shanhaiyuan restaurant in such a big way. For a while, from the shopkeeper to the waiter, including the only two tables of guests, they were stunned, and no one came to greet her.</p>
<p>However, Xiaobai seems to have been used to this kind of scene for a long time. He is not angry. He just smiles and says, &ldquo;is there no one to serve?&rdquo;</p>
<p>After all, the shopkeeper was old and still had some strength of concentration. He was in a daze, and the waiter stood beside him with a look on the back of his head and said angrily, &ldquo;if the guests come, don&rsquo;t you want to greet them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bartender staggered, wondering if there was a ghost in his heart. Looking forward to Ai Ai coming up, she did not dare to face Xiaobai squarely and said with a smile, &ldquo;girl, do you want to eat or stay in the hotel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaobai thought for a moment and said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;d better eat something first. Do you have an elegant seat here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The waiter nodded and said, &ldquo;yes, yes, please go upstairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaobai nodded and went upstairs, saying, &ldquo;please find me a quiet place by the window.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bartender said with a smile: &ldquo;girl, don&rsquo;t worry. You are the only one in the elegant seat upstairs. You can get any seat you want, and you can be quiet. No one will disturb you. &quot;</p>
<p>Xiaobai was stunned for a moment and said, &ldquo;how can nobody? I heard that the business here was very good before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this time, the bartender had already reached the upper floor and said with a wry smile, &ldquo;who said it was not. At the beginning, the business was very good. All the people in Heyang were interested in drinking here. But God killed, a while ago, the beast demon made people panic, and finally killed and injured countless. At this time, not many people will want to come here. &quot;</p>
<p>Xiaobai nodded slowly, sighed softly, and said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s so. It&rsquo;s no wonder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this time, the bartender had already brought Xiaobai upstairs to a table by the window and sat down. He was wiping the table with his rag.</p>
<p>Xiaobai sits in his seat and looks out of the window. He sees pedestrians coming and going on the street, which is quite lively. However, most people have few smiles on their faces. On the contrary, there are more people with sad faces.</p>
<p>Xiaobai looked at it silently for a moment. Suddenly he asked the bartender, &ldquo;waiter, I ask you something. You should answer me honestly.</p>
<p>&quot;</p>
<p>The shopkeeper nodded and said, &ldquo;excuse me, girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaobai hesitated for a moment and said, &ldquo;do all the people in Heyang City, including you, hate that beast demon in their hearts?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bartender snorted, his face suddenly showed a look of resentment, and said in a loud voice: &ldquo;of course, this city of Heyang was empty in that animal demon disaster. If you go to the street and ask someone at will, I guarantee that he has relatives who died under the claws of the beast. Poor people are unarmed and can&rsquo;t resist, but fortunately there are immortals on Qingyun Mountain. With great compassion and great power, we have driven away the monsters that were killed that day. This has made us live a human life again. &quot;</p>
<p>Xiaobai looked at the excited look of the bartender and gave a bitter smile in his heart. He didn&rsquo;t know how. And then the figure of the man who lingers under the residual fire in the depths of the magic ancient cave in Nanjiang town.</p>
<p>Who is clear about the right and wrong in this world?</p>
<p>The bartender also seemed to find that he had lost his manners. His face turned red and he stepped back. He said in a low voice, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just talk about this and this. Girl, don&rsquo;t take it seriously. Do you want to order?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaobai laughed and said, &ldquo;OK, but you don&rsquo;t have to order any dishes. Go down and tell the shopkeeper that you can make three or four dishes of the dishes you are good at. In addition, you can bring up ten pots of good wine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The waiter was stunned and said, &ldquo;ten pots?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaobai looked at him and nodded: &ldquo;ten pots.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bartender smothered for a moment, then hesitated for a long time, and whispered, &ldquo;Miss, do you have any friends who want to come? If so, I can add some dishes and chopsticks in advance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaobai said with a smile, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t think about it. I&rsquo;m the only one. I need ten bottles of wine. Please bring it up quickly. Don&rsquo;t ask about the rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bartender retreated, but the look in his eyes was obviously unbelievable. In fact, he can&rsquo;t blame him. The most powerful ordinary person can drink only one or two pots. A large number of people who can drink four or five pots are not wine immortals but also drunkards. However, this charming and infinite woman is obviously an ordinary person who can not be judged by common sense.</p>
<p>Because there were not many guests, soon the waiter had brought up the dishes that Xiaobai wanted and put them on the table. The ten pots were engraved with the wine pots of shanhaiyuan, which were placed at the other end of the table.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also a good time for a restaurant to have a light business. Otherwise, if it&rsquo;s busy, I&rsquo;m afraid it won&rsquo;t attract customers from all over the restaurant? But even so, Xiaobai will not care!</p>
<p>The bartender went down quickly, and only Xiaobai was left on the elegant seat. She poured and drank from herself. Soon, a pot of fine wine was already at the bottom, and a faint pink color appeared on her cheek, which did not show half the wine flavor, but added a bit of charm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas&hellip;&rdquo; Suddenly, so gently, she sighed.</p>
<p>The wine is as pure as amber and as thin as a line. It is poured into the glass from the mouth of the pot, splashing with tiny water spray. Xiaobai stares at the glass in front of him and looks at his faint reflection on the water. Then she smile, smile there is a trace of bitterness, will pick up the glass, drink.</p>
<p>The street outside the window, people make a variety of sounds, flowing, hustle and bustle, those sounds, seems to be very far away, as if in another world.</p>
<p>She set the sixth empty jug aside.</p>
<p>The gentle red on her cheek, set off her eternal beauty, her eyes, still clear.</p>
<p>Never drunk, never drunk!</p>
<p>Her white teeth, gently bit the lower lip, a person, low smile, and then a shake of the head, raise hand pour wine. Outside the window, on the street, somehow, it seemed that the noise suddenly became a little louder. Xiaobai frowned and moved to the window and looked at the street.</p>
<p>This glance swept away, and she was suddenly stunned. Down the street, she saw a woman in white walking slowly. Her face was clear and beautiful. She was floating like a fairy, but she was not Lu Xueqi. Who was she?</p>
<p>It seems that the people around are attracted by Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s unique appearance, but they are also frightened by her cold temperament. They dare not go forward directly and gather from afar to watch and discuss. This is the reason. Xiaobai looks at Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s figure, and a smile slowly rises from the corner of her mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve met everywhere in my life&hellip;&rdquo; She said to herself with a smile in her mouth, and then she stood up and looked at her as if she wanted to take the initiative to say hello to Lu Xueqi.</p>
<p>Only her body stood up, and suddenly her expression was stunned. Her eyes turned away from Lu Xueqi under the street and floated to a remote corner in the distance of Heyang city.</p>
<p>A familiar black figure flashed by quickly, and then disappeared into another dark corner. After a while, another gray figure, which was not strange to her, was chasing her.</p>
<p>Xiaobai stares at the corner for a moment, and then a hint of sarcasm and smile appears in the corner of his mouth. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a coincidence today. If you don&rsquo;t join in the fun, I&rsquo;m really sorry for myself, but I&rsquo;m sorry for the old ghost of Shangguan, hehe, hehe&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the cold laughter, her figure suddenly disappeared from the elegant seat above shanhaiyuan. After a long time, the bartender came to clean up and saw only a ding of silver on the table, six empty wine pots, and four pots, but they had disappeared.</p>
<p>On the street, Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s figure, I don&rsquo;t know when, suddenly disappeared from the street. (to be continued. )</p>
