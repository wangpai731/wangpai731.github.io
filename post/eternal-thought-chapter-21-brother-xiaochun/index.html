<p>I&rsquo;d like to present today&rsquo;s update. By the way, I&rsquo;d like to draw a vote for the &ldquo;starting point&rdquo; 515 fan Festival. Everyone has 8 tickets. I&rsquo;d like to give you some money to vote for!</p>
<p>Wanyao Pavilion is one of the most lively places on Xiangyun. There are many disciples coming in and going out almost every day. On the one hand, it is because of the ten steles; on the other hand, the Wanyao Pavilion in the middle of the ten steles is the place where the contribution points can be exchanged for herbs and pills.</p>
<p>Even here, there are regular examinations for promotion of medicine apprentices and the recovery of pills refined by disciples. For various reasons, there is a great deal of people here every day.</p>
<p>As time goes by, the liveliness of the place has also become a place for information exchange among clansmen. At the beginning, it is a place for people to exchange experiences on plants and plants. Later, some big and small matters or gossip will be spread out here.</p>
<p>When Bai Xiaochun arrived, there were many outside disciples around the Wanyao Pavilion, either in and out, or in groups or in groups. Under the steles around, there were many disciples waiting in line to challenge the stone tablet&rsquo;s ranking.</p>
<p>After squeezing from the crowd for a long time, Bai Xiaochun got close to the second stone tablet. Just as he was about to pass away, he had three disciples from other schools who were talking to each other and seemed to mention himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you heard that recently, a strange thing happened in our family. Someone specially stole the Lingwei chicken from Li Zhangzuo. It is said that hundreds of chickens have been lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are more than a hundred chickens. I heard that the chickens of Li Zhangzuo are almost stolen. The chicken thief has been wanted by those disciples who keep Lingwei chicken. Put down the cruel words and feed the chicken in large pieces!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s also strange that we Xiangyun mountain always has a wonderful flower recently. First, there is a mysterious turtle, and then the chicken thief!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun subconsciously shrunk his neck and felt guilty. He felt that he had stolen some chickens and made such a big noise. Looking at this form, it seems that everyone knows it.</p>
<p>And at the moment, he was even more scared when he heard that Lingwei chicken was actually Li Qinghou.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t steal that much. Bai Xiaochun felt that he had been framed and was thinking about how to change people&rsquo;s impression of the chicken thief. Suddenly, he heard the noise behind him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little girl, squeeze what squeeze, rush to reincarnation ah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you? You&rsquo;re amazing. Don&rsquo;t come here for fear of crowding you. It&rsquo;s your pleasure to squeeze you, miss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun felt that the voice behind her was familiar, so she looked back and saw a young girl with a small chest and a small waist. She was facing a big man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hou Xiaomei?&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun blinked.</p>
<p>This little girl is Hou Xiaomei. When she hears the voice, she sees Bai Xiaochun. The arrogance of her small face turns into a surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brother chun, it&rsquo;s you!&rdquo; Hou Xiaomei twists her waist and rushes to her. Before she gets close to her, she has a hot and pure breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, little sister Chun.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun looks at the girl who is full of vitality and looks very lovely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little pure elder brother, you are good or bad, unexpectedly amuse people, people call Hou Xiaomei!&rdquo; Hou Xiaomei heard Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s words, but her face turned red. She was so naive.</p>
<p>In this way, the young girl, who was full of vigor and vitality, suddenly became more beautiful and moving. Many of the disciples around her were shining in front of her eyes, while the big man was full of goose bumps. She felt that the little girl had changed too much and was moody.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little brother chun, my brother didn&rsquo;t come back down the mountain. This is the first time I&rsquo;ve come here to exchange for grass and trees. Second, where should I go to change it?&rdquo; Hou Xiaomei quickly asked, she is indeed the first time to come, before her brother to help busy nagging, at the moment is not how to deal with, saw Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun introduced the process to Hou Xiaomei with a smile. She said it in great detail. She nodded from time to time. At the end, she fully understood. When she looked at Bai Xiaochun, she felt that her elder martial brother was not only a good person, but also understood so much.</p>
<p>After the introduction, Bai Xiaochun took a look at Hou Xiaomei, but she didn&rsquo;t resist it. So she raised her right hand to the stone tablet of the first chapter of vegetation and pretended to be indifferent to the wind and light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can see that stone tablet. All the people who can leave their mark on it are the arrogant generation of the whole clan. Any one&rsquo;s future achievements will stir up the Xiuzhen world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t talk about others. I&rsquo;ll introduce you to the second place. You can see the mark of the vase. It&rsquo;s the proud daughter of Xiangyun mountain, Zhou Xinqi!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zhou Xinqi, it turns out that this vase represents elder martial sister Zhou who has the spiritual pulse of plants and plants. She has been accepted as a disciple by the palm seat, and is destined to become the elder martial sister of the inner school!&rdquo; Hou Xiaomei&rsquo;s eyes suddenly brightened, and she looked up at the vase mark on the first stone tablet. Her eyes showed the meaning of worship. For Zhou Xinqi, she had heard Hou Yunfei talk about it, and she admired her very much. At the moment, when she heard Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s introduction, she was more excited.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun continued to put on a light air and waited there for a long time. However, she found that Hou Xiaomei was still looking at the vase and ignored the tortoise riding on the vase. Her heart was suddenly upset. He introduced so much, not just to lead to a topic and talk about the beautiful turtle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keke, this week Xinqi is really extraordinary, so it becomes the second place in the first inscription of the plant!&rdquo; In the second place, he stressed the tone to remind Hou Xiaomei.</p>
<p>Hou Xiaomei a Leng, look carefully, show eyebrow suddenly frown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Second? Who is the turtle on the top of elder martial sister Zhou? It&rsquo;s really ugly. &quot;</p>
<p>When Bai Xiaochun heard this, he was even more upset. He felt that it was very necessary for him to educate Hou Xiaomei in front of him, so he put on a serious look and spoke with great care.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you are wrong, little sister. Do you know that this beautiful tortoise is the most mysterious, greatest and most detached disciple of our clan today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are too many rumors about this man. Every time he appears, he will cause the uproar of the clan, ignite the eyes of all the disciples, attract the attention of countless people, envy and cheer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah?&rdquo; Hou Xiaomei&rsquo;s character is simple, at the moment, she was stunned and doubted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know that this man was born two months ago, which broke Zhou Xinqi&rsquo;s desire to be the first in nine steles!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know that as soon as this person appears, he can easily take away the first part of the first chapter of the vegetation with a wave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know that after witnessing this incident, Zhou Xinqi stayed here for seven consecutive days, repeatedly selecting again and again, but finally he put all together, and was still the second, willing to be inferior.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know, I&rsquo;m Bai Xiaochun Cough. &quot;</p>
<p>The more Bai Xiaochun said, the more excited he became. In the end, he almost said that he was the great turtle master. He quickly resisted that his ideal was to say his identity in front of the public, not in front of a little girl. This would waste his emotions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; Hou Xiaomei showed a bright light in her eyes, like a little star at night. Looking at the little turtle, she was adoring her face, and her face was red.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true, of course.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun felt that he had done a good deed to successfully guide a child who was on a wrong path to the right path. He felt quite a sense of achievement. At the moment, Xiaoxiu shook his sleeve and ignored Hou Xiaomei, who was immersed in worship, and walked towards the second stone tablet.</p>
<p>After crowding through the crowd and waiting for a moment to wait for an empty wooden house, Bai Xiaochun strides into the building and disappears.</p>
<p>The wooden house is as old as before. Bai Xiaochun sits in front of the stone tablet and draws the tortoise again. When she sees a flower in front of her eyes and roars in her ears, she appears in the familiar illusory space. This time, without the cold sound, there are almost countless pieces of grass and trees, which suddenly appear.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun has a plan in mind, and his hands are very fast. In the blink of an eye, a plant of spirit grass is complete in an instant.</p>
<p>As time went by, when the time for a stick of incense was over, there were only less than 5000 pieces left in front of Bai Xiaochun, which was much better than when he wrote the first piece of grass and trees.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when the time came, Bai Xiaochun had a flower in front of him. When he was clear again, he had already returned to the wooden house. Nevertheless, he was full of confidence. He picked up the plants he had bought. With a strong expectation in his heart, he turned and pushed the door of the wooden house directly.</p>
<p>Looking at the numerous outside disciples, at the moment, not many people have noticed the change of rank. Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s heart rises with pride.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This time, I want to shock the whole clan and let everyone know that I am Bai Xiaochun is the great turtle Lord!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun even came up with a picture in her mind that she was adored by thousands of people, and even Hou Xiaomei was surprised.</p>
<p>At the thought of this, Bai Xiaochun couldn&rsquo;t help laughing, so he raised his right hand arrogantly and was about to roar. He took the initiative to remind everyone that he was the great turtle master</p>
<p>But at this time, all of a sudden, he was standing in line to try the outside disciples, the voice came out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think the little tortoise who stole the show of senior sister Zhou dare to appear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare not. Those admirers of elder martial sister Zhou are all crazy. It is said that they are looking for the little turtle all over the south bank, and put down their opinions. Once they are found, they should be scraped alive&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard about it, and even the inner disciples are involved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s right hand had just been raised. After hearing these remarks, he was suddenly shocked. Especially when he heard that the inner disciples were participating in the search for himself, a layer of cold sweat appeared on his forehead. His right hand quickly scratched his head, pretending nothing had happened, and quickly put it down.</p>
<p>Anger in the heart, showing the appearance of a sad face, sad sigh appearance, drilling into the crowd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too much. It&rsquo;s too bullying. I just take the first one. All the inner disciples are out. As for it.&rdquo; This time, his look was real and he didn&rsquo;t pretend at all.</p>
<p>Just walking into the crowd, some people have discovered the change of the second stone tablet, and soon, bursts of unbelievable uproar roared into the sky.</p>
<hr>
<p>12:00 tonight, keep the appointment!</p>
<p>[it&rsquo;s about to be 515 soon. I hope it can continue to impact the 515 red envelope list. On May 15, the red envelope rain will give back to readers and publicity works. A piece is also love, must be better! ]</p>
