      <p>Qingyun Mountain, Dazhu peak.</p>
<p>Outside the Shoujing hall, the disciples of dazhufeng, starting from Song Daren to Du Bishu, stood outside the door in a row, their faces worried and worried, and they looked at the hall from time to time.</p>
<p>After a while, Shoujing hall sounded the sound of footsteps, out of a woman, but xiaozhufeng Wenmin.</p>
<p>Song Daren and other disciples of dazhufeng gathered around. Song Daren and Wen Min knew each other. Looking at the empty space behind Wen Min, he asked in a low voice, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter with my Shiniang?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wen Min nodded and said in a soft voice, &ldquo;Uncle Su is no longer in any way. When I went back to the mountain just now, I suddenly fainted. I heard from my master that it was because I was worried too much. Now my master is there with her and has already woken up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren and other people are all relieved, but no one can be happy on his face.</p>
<p>Du Bishu said with a bitter face: &ldquo;this is really a bolt from the blue! I didn&rsquo;t hear from Shifu. Now, even Shiniang almost had an accident. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo; Song Daren frowned and drank. Du Bishu laughed bitterly and shook his head.</p>
<p>Song Daren turned to Wen Min and said, &ldquo;did my teacher mother ask you to tell us anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wen Min shook his head and said, &ldquo;no, uncle Su just talked to my master in a low voice. After a few words, the master asked me to come out. It seems that he doesn&rsquo;t want me to know anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren frowned and said, &ldquo;this This&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>Seeing that he was in a hurry, Wen Min could not bear to say, &ldquo;elder martial brother song, don&rsquo;t worry too much. Anyway, what a big matter, is there still uncle Su and my master there! Now something has changed. Uncle Su is exhausted. You have to bear more of the burden here. &quot;</p>
<p>Song Daren sighed and nodded: &ldquo;you&rsquo;re talking about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pondered for a moment, then turned to the other younger martial brothers and said, &ldquo;OK, OK, now that you know the safety of the Shiniang, I say you don&rsquo;t have to stand here all the time. Otherwise, if the teacher&rsquo;s wife knew, she would be confused. We should go back to our rooms first. We still have to do our homework. I&rsquo;ll stay here first. &quot;</p>
<p>Wu Dayi, he Dazhi and Du Bishu looked at each other. After a moment&rsquo;s silence, Wu Dayi nodded and said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s OK. Let&rsquo;s listen to the elder martial brother.&rdquo; With that, he turned to song Daren.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elder martial brother, I will come to replace you later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren just wanted to shake his head and refuse. He Dazhi patted him on the shoulder and said, &ldquo;elder martial brother, you tell us to have a good rest. You can&rsquo;t do anything wrong, and your mother won&rsquo;t like you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren smiles bitterly and nods. At the moment, everyone gradually dispersed. Only song Daren and Wen Min stood outside the Shoujing hall, speechless for a moment.</p>
<p>They looked at each other. Wen Min suddenly blushed and slowly lowered his head. Song Daren coughed, but he felt his heart beat faster. He quickly settled down and laughed twice and said, &ldquo;Wen Younger martial sister, didn&rsquo;t you just go to southern Xinjiang with Lu Xueqi from xiaozhufeng not long ago? Why did you come back so soon? &quot;</p>
<p>Wen Min shook his head and said, &ldquo;I went to Nanjiang, and I didn&rsquo;t intend to come back so early. However, some strange things happened there. After discussing with younger martial sister Lu, I felt that this matter was very important, so I rushed back to report to the master and the elders. Younger sister Lu is still in southern Xinjiang, acting according to circumstances. &quot;</p>
<p>Song Daren was stunned and said, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s so important?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wen Min hesitated for a moment, looked around, and then approached song Daren and whispered a few words in his ear. Before she finished speaking, song Daren&rsquo;s face changed a little.</p>
<p>Waiting for Wenmin came together, then left his side, stood in front of him, looked at him, sighed low, and said, &ldquo;now you know why I have to come back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a long time, song Daren said, &ldquo;this What a eventful time! &quot;</p>
<p>Wen Min was silent for a long time and said in a low voice: &ldquo;who said it was not! I also think it&rsquo;s really a wave of ups and downs, and after I came back, this kind of thing happened in my family Ah! &quot;</p>
<p>She sighed and didn&rsquo;t say any more. Song Daren stood with her. Suddenly, she felt that the woman beside her was emaciated. She felt a little more tender and weak. She couldn&rsquo;t help standing closer.</p>
<p>Wen Min is lowering his head and meditating. He seems to have no feeling, but the corner of his mouth moves slightly, but he doesn&rsquo;t speak. He just stands quietly.</p>
<p>Two figures, just like this quietly stand outside the hall of dazhufeng.</p>
<p>In the distance, there are waves of bamboo waves on Dazhu peak, and the warm sunshine is shining down. In the blue sky, however, it is the beautiful scene with clear sky and cloudless sky, which gently looks at the world.</p>
<p>In the backyard of Shoujing hall and the secluded bedroom, two women sit opposite each other.</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue was silent for a long time and said, &ldquo;younger martial sister, you&rsquo;d better go to bed and lie down for a while!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru slowly shook her head. Although she looked tired, she still said firmly and in a low voice: &ldquo;if I don&rsquo;t go, I can&rsquo;t sleep even if I go to bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue sighed and said, &ldquo;younger martial sister, don&rsquo;t worry too much. Just like what I said to you just now, Tian Buyi and the headmaster didn&rsquo;t see each other at the same time. You didn&rsquo;t see his real encounter If there is any accident, don&rsquo;t think about it. What&rsquo;s more, although elder martial brother Xuan has some problems recently, he is far ahead of us in his cultivation of magic power. His determination is also the same. Tian is his junior brother for many years, and he definitely won&rsquo;t mess around. &quot;</p>
<p>Su Ru was silent, but her eyes were slightly red.</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue shook his head, stood up and walked back and forth in the room for several steps, obviously also a little upset. At present, even ordinary disciples can see the chaos in Qingyun gate, not to mention the elders who know some inside information.</p>
<p>Su ruqiang chuckled and turned the subject aside and said, &ldquo;elder martial sister, why did you suddenly go to Tongtian peak today?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue said angrily: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not all about the broken things in yunyilan of the burning incense valley. I was going to discuss with the headmaster, but I didn&rsquo;t expect that such a big thing happened again. In the end, even the head of the hall disappeared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru frowned and said, &ldquo;Yun Yi Lan, the master of incense Valley? What does he have to do with us? &quot;</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue sneered and said, &ldquo;do you know that our disciples Lu Xueqi and Wen Min went to southern Xinjiang to investigate the whereabouts of the monster?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru nodded and said, &ldquo;yes! I was just wondering! How can you see that Wen Min has come back so soon? Is Lu Xueqi back with you? &quot;</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue shook his head and said, &ldquo;Xueqi hasn&rsquo;t come back yet. This time, it&rsquo;s after their discussion. Wen Min first came back to the mountain to report to me. &quot;</p>
<p>Su Ru said, &ldquo;what happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue said, &ldquo;when they went to visit Yun Yilan in southern Xinjiang, Yun Yilan suddenly asked them whether our ancient sword for killing immortals in Qingyun gate had been damaged!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru&rsquo;s face changed greatly and she said in astonishment, &ldquo;what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue sneered: &ldquo;are you surprised! I heard about it.</p>
<p>Really is also for its vibration, cloud Yi Lan body thousands of miles away, how can know this great secret? On that day, elder martial brother daoxuan told several of our disciples to guard against thieves. He was afraid that the incident would be disclosed. Do you remember that? &quot;</p>
<p>Su Ru was silent for a long time. His eyes were worried again, and he sighed, &ldquo;this is a bad thing that has spread far and wide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue paced back and forth and said, &ldquo;and have you ever thought about why Yun Yilan said this to those young people?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru nodded slowly and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinking about this too. If it&rsquo;s for the sake of the same righteousness, he shouldn&rsquo;t mention it in public, but he has to hide it for us. If not, he has a sinister intention, but he should keep it secret. It&rsquo;s the right time for people like him to do it. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not bad!&rdquo; Master Shuiyue snorted and said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the problem. The old man, Yun Yilan, looks like he&rsquo;s doing a fool&rsquo;s stupid thing. He doesn&rsquo;t like both sides. But we all know that this man is not a fool, but a crafty man. But what he wants to do is really hard to understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru pondered for a long time, but suddenly reached out and rubbed her forehead, showing a painful color.</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue was surprised. She quickly came over and helped her, and said to herself, &ldquo;look at me, you are upset enough. I still tell you this. Well, no more, no more&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>Su Ru said with a wry smile: &ldquo;Alas If there had been a leader and elder martial brother in charge of the overall situation in the past, we would not have been afraid of these things. But now the Qingyun gate is in a mess. The current situation outside is extremely chaotic. I don&rsquo;t know how many foreign enemies are waiting. I really don&rsquo;t know what to do. &quot;</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue frowned and said in a soft voice, &ldquo;stop talking, younger martial sister. What do you think you are tired. Didn&rsquo;t I tell you that although the headmaster&rsquo;s temper is a little strange these days, he is different from the past, but he has a firm mind and practices Taoism. We don&rsquo;t have to be afraid of anything. &quot;</p>
<p>Su Ru shook her head and said casually, &ldquo;elder martial sister, you don&rsquo;t understand. Although the leader&rsquo;s elder martial brother is very good at Taoism, his fierce and violent spirit of killing immortals is stronger than before. Although he has a high level of Taoism, he is afraid that he will become more and more possessed by the devil&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue was stunned and said, &ldquo;what are you talking about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru was startled. She realized that she was just trying to cover up her past. Master Shuiyue frowned deeply and went to her. Su Rong said, &ldquo;younger martial sister, what are the secrets of the ancient sword of killing immortals? Tell me what you know.</p>
<p>&quot;</p>
<p>Su Ru was silent for a long time. She sighed and said, &ldquo;well, now that we are, sooner or later, we can&rsquo;t hide it. Elder martial sister, I&rsquo;ll tell you! In fact, it was more than a hundred years ago&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>There are 100000 mountains in southern Xinjiang, deep in Zhenmo ancient cave.</p>
<p>Seeing each other again after a long separation, Xiaobai and Guili have a feeling that they don&rsquo;t know what to say. Only monkey Xiaohui, who lies on the shoulder of GUI Li, seems very happy to see Xiaobai and grins incessantly.</p>
<p>Suddenly, he was stunned. He seemed to think of something. He turned his head and looked at the road. But it was only dark. He frowned and said to Xiao Bai, &ldquo;what have you done to the woman who came with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaobai snorted and said, &ldquo;what can I do with her? You have so many things to worry about. &quot;</p>
<p>He was silent for a moment and shook his head. He didn&rsquo;t want to get entangled in this issue. He then said, &ldquo;by the way, why are you here? I haven&rsquo;t heard from you since you left that day. This time, I came to Nanjiang and inquired about it secretly, but I couldn&rsquo;t find you. &quot;</p>
<p>Xiaobai smiles, and his figure seems to sway gently in the blue light. There is a moving charm between them. He says: &ldquo;I told you when I left. I want to find the&rdquo; eight fierce XuanHuo array &ldquo;for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember, so I also went to the xuanhuotan in the burning incense Valley, but I didn&rsquo;t find anything. By the way, you haven&rsquo;t said what you&rsquo;ve done in the ancient magic cave. &quot;</p>
<p>Xiaobai shrugged his shoulders and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here. Naturally, it&rsquo;s for the array, and I&rsquo;ll see an old friend by the way. &quot;</p>
<p>He looked at her, pondered for a moment, and said, &ldquo;do you mean here&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaobai nodded and said, &ldquo;yes. After the array at the xuanhuotan in the burning incense valley was damaged, the only place in the world is the eight evil XuanHuo array left in this ancient cave. Besides, my old friend happens to be here. &quot;</p>
<p>His face changed and he said slowly, &ldquo;is that old friend you mentioned&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaobai smiles. &ldquo;He is the king of the beast demon in your mouth, the God of the beast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although GUI Li thought of it more or less, he was still stunned when he heard Xiaobai say it himself. He didn&rsquo;t know what to say for a moment.</p>
<p>After a long time, he said slowly, &ldquo;how can you make friends with him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Looking at him, Xiaobai still has a soft smile on his face, but his eyes are clear as water, but he seems to have a bit of sarcasm and says: &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you know. I&rsquo;m an old goblin. As I get older, I naturally know more things and know more monsters. &quot;</p>
<p>He looked at him and said, &ldquo;what about you! What are you doing here? Just now you said that the ghost king ordered that woman to bring you here. What is he trying to do? &quot;</p>
<p>Ghost Li shook his head and said, &ldquo;the Lord of ghost king asked me to come here, but I didn&rsquo;t want to pursue the beast God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaobai was stunned and said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not killing him. What do you have to do here? &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He asked me to take a strange beast Taotie around the beast God and take it back to him,&rdquo; he said</p>
<p>&ldquo;Taotie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaobai was stunned again, frowned and thought for a moment, then said to himself, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s strange. When did he become interested in Taotie? &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about it. Anyway, he gave orders like this, so I&rsquo;ll do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaobai snorted and said, &ldquo;that Taotie is a spirit beast that has never been separated from the animal God for a moment. If you want to take it, you must pass the level of animal God. Are you sure you can beat the beast God? Or do you think that after he was injured, he wanted to be killed? &quot;</p>
<p>GUI Li looked at Xiaobai, did not speak. After a moment, he suddenly gave a slight smile. However, he stepped forward and walked towards the deeper darkness of the cave.</p>
<p>With a slight change of complexion, Xiaobai followed him and said, &ldquo;what do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Hui, lying on the shoulder of GUI Li, saw Xiao Bai beside him. He jumped down from Gui Li&rsquo;s shoulder and landed on Xiao Bai. Xiaobai catches the monkey, hugs it in front of her chest, touches its head, and can&rsquo;t help but have some kind of friendly color in her eyes, and then turns to see the ghost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know what the Lord ordered me to do, as long as it&rsquo;s not too much, I&rsquo;ll do it for him,&rdquo; he said slowly</p>
<p>Xiaobai snorted and said, &ldquo;have you ever thought that if you do this yourself, you may feel more comfortable, but what you have done over the years may not be all that Biyao likes you to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fierce steps suddenly stopped, and the whole person seemed to stop for a moment.</p>
<p>Xiaobai frowned and stopped, but he didn&rsquo;t go to see the ghost. Instead, he looked down at the monkey and stroked his hair. Xiao Hui&rsquo;s three eyes blinked, as if some do not understand, for a while to see Xiaobai, and then to the master.</p>
<p>After a long silence, he murmured, &ldquo;since you know it will make me feel better, why do you still say that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaobai sighed and did not speak.</p>
<p>The ghostly figure suddenly seemed a little lonely, but he stood in the dark blue light, but did not look back, just as he had been used to it and never looked back. He was silent for a long time, and finally only said: &ldquo;I have not done anything that is harmful to nature!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, he did not say a word more and went on.</p>
<p>Looking at the figure, Xiaobai is also silent. After a long time, she looks at Xiaohui in her arms, but sees the monkey&rsquo;s three eyes looking at himself.</p>
<p>Xiaobai gave a bitter smile and said, &ldquo;your master! It&rsquo;s really strange that I haven&rsquo;t been crazy for more than ten years. &quot;</p>
<p>The two figures walked for a long time in the depths of Zhenmo ancient cave. They were not in a hurry. Xiaobai seemed to have a lot of thoughts. They did not stop GUI Li from looking for the animal God, nor did they open their mouth to point out the direction of the road. They just walked behind him, thinking.</p>
<p>Suddenly, GUI Li stopped. In front of him and in the darkness ahead, a faint green light flashed constantly, glittering several feet above the ground.</p>
<p>And all around, a silence, not to mention breathing, is that even those evil Warcraft smell are not at all.</p>
<p>At this time, Xiaobai, who was walking behind GUI Li, sighed and said, &ldquo;here we are. Under the green light in front of us is a door. After that door is a big stone room. The people and animals you are looking for are all in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li didn&rsquo;t speak, but Xiao Hui looked at Xiaobai&rsquo;s face, jumped up suddenly, jumped back to the ghost&rsquo;s shoulder several times, and then turned back to Xiaobai with a grin and touched his head.</p>
<p>Xiaobai also smiles at Xiaohui, and then says to the ghost: &ldquo;listen to me, I have a good friendship with the beast God, so I&rsquo;m afraid I can&rsquo;t help you deal with him.</p>
<p>Although you haven&rsquo;t dealt with him, I think you should know more or less about it! Although he was badly hurt by the sword of killing immortals, he was not able to deal with it by ordinary people who practice the truth, so&hellip; &quot; She looked at him and said slowly, &ldquo;really, it&rsquo;s not too late for you to let go now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li was silent for a moment, but he slowly shook his head to Xiaobai. Then he inhaled deeply and settled his mind. He walked to the green light. Looking at his figure, Xiaobai didn&rsquo;t keep up with him. In his eyes, there was a faint trace of bitterness and tenderness in his eyes.</p>
<p>Suddenly, she raised her voice slightly towards the ghostly figure and said, &ldquo;do you still have that dark fire on you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a pause, he turned around and said, &ldquo;yes, what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shook his head slowly and said, &ldquo;remember: first, the beast God can be defeated; second, in a critical moment, you can test it with XuanHuo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li nodded. Although he was still confused, he didn&rsquo;t want to ask more questions and said, &ldquo;thank you very much.&rdquo; Said, continue to turn around, into the dark.</p>
<p>Far away, came the monkey small ash &ldquo;squeak&rdquo; a few whispers.</p>
<p>Looking at the darkness, Xiaobai stood in situ, standing in silence, as if he had been stunned, and seemed to be waiting for something in silence.</p>
<p>Under the green light, there was indeed a stone gate, but the door had long been gone. The green light clearly seen at the moment turned out to be a huge green gem, which was inlaid on the cliff of the stone gate.</p>
<p>There was no pause. He went in, and his eyes were suddenly bright. A burning brazier was placed on the ground in the distance. Around the fire light of the fire pot, there was also a darkness. It was hard to see how big the stone chamber was. But behind the fire, he really saw a man, a man in bright silk clothes, with his back on a small stone platform, sitting on the ground, smiling at him.</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s face, he was once familiar with, and in the man&rsquo;s side, the evil beast Taotie slowly stood up, full of hostile low growl.</p>
<p>The man, who looked a little coquettish, looked tired, but in his eyes, he seemed to have a faint smile. He said to the ghost standing at the door with a smile: &ldquo;we meet again!&rdquo; (to be continued. )</p>
