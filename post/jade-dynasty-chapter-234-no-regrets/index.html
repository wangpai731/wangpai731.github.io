      <p>In his current way, he suddenly dumped all the flowers and trees on both sides of the road, like a gap in the sea. The face of the wind, because he was too fast and blowing face faint pain, but he did not care.</p>
<p>At the moment, in his heart, there was only Su Ru&rsquo;s figure in the bamboo forest behind the mountain.</p>
<p>The bark of rhubarb is still in my ears, which is extremely manic. The ghostly figure rises from the stone steps at the foot of the mountain, making a sharp sound of breaking the sky, and rushes up the stone steps. People are still in the air, but the heart of the ghost is suddenly cold, almost unable to control, almost fell down.</p>
<p>On the ground, I don&rsquo;t know when there are two more caves with a width of one person. Beside them are two piles of soil. Judging from the moisture of the soil, Su Ru must have dug it by herself. At the thought of the use of these two caves, he was pale and his scalp was numb. But Tian Bu Yi&rsquo;s body still lies quietly in its original place, and does not move. But Su Ru, who is most worried about at the moment, pours on Tian Bu Yi&rsquo;s chest and does not move.</p>
<p>Next to her, rhubarb was barking at Su Ru.</p>
<p>GUI Li&rsquo;s heart sank down. Looking at the slim figure that was still in front of him not long ago, he had a kind of timidity that he did not dare to face and dare not to approach. At this time, on the stone steps behind him, slowly appeared the pale Lu Xueqi, who stood far away, gazing at all this.</p>
<p>GUI Li suppressed his wild heartbeat, and called softly: &ldquo;teacher Niang?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Su Ru&rsquo;s body did not move, there was no response.</p>
<p>The ferocious step slowly forward, each step seems very difficult, rhubarb&rsquo;s bark is still endless. Finally, he approached Su Ru&rsquo;s body and whispered: &ldquo;Shiniang Don&rsquo;t scare me&hellip; &ldquo;.</p>
<p>Wei&rsquo;s trembling hand touched Su Ru&rsquo;s shoulder, bit her teeth, and turned Su Ru&rsquo;s body over with force. An unexpected face with a smile appeared in front of him.</p>
<p>Su Ru smiles. The corner of the mouth seems to have a trace of comfort, perhaps with her husband together.</p>
<p>Her body was still warm, her expression was still quiet and dignified, but she was not angry.</p>
<p>The bark of rhubarb is still howling wildly. But the voice is becoming hoarse!.</p>
<p>Ghouli legs a soft, sitting on the ground, after an instant, a blank mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shiniang also went to&hellip;&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It was the only cry in his mind, echoing endlessly in his heart.</p>
<p>The next day. The rest of Qingyun gate received the bad news from dazhufeng. First Tian and his wife Su Ru died.</p>
<p>Tian Buyi and his wife are very important in Qingyun gate, and they are always popular. In a flash, the sad news shocked the Qingyun gate, and a large number of mourning colleagues flew to dazhufeng. Tian linger, who rushed back from the dragon head peak, was crying in front of her parents&rsquo; spirits. The rest of the elders, who were all accomplished in their cultivation of Taoism, were also tearful, especially the first master Shuiyue of xiaozhufeng, who had always been the best friend to Su Ru.</p>
<p>In this solemn and sorrowful atmosphere, there are still some abnormal clues. Tian is not popular with his wife. All the other veins were present, but in the changmen Tongtian peak, although there were many elders of the previous generation, there was no trace of the Taoist immortal, the leader of the sect and the Taoist immortal of Qingyun sect. This can not help but show that Tongtian peak despises the whole line of Dazhu peak.</p>
<p>Song Daren and other disciples of dazhufeng are all very filial and mournful. They are respectful and respectful when they come and see Xiao Yicai and other elder disciples. However, his face was angry, and his speech became colder. Xiao Yicai and others felt ashamed and were not easy to say anything. In addition to a bitter smile, he had to stand aside and shut up.</p>
<p>Incense, crying, this piece of sad meaning, most of the loss of the old man, in the original beautiful and quiet Dazhu peak mountain floating. Man lives all his life. But I don&rsquo;t know if there is really a spirit after death. If it is, then the old man looks at all these things in the dark, and I don&rsquo;t know how he will feel?.</p>
<p>But it must not be easy. It won&rsquo;t be sad!.</p>
<p>A figure, floating down from the direction of Qingyun Mountain, seems to be a bit at a loss, in the afternoon, alone into the city of Heyang.</p>
<p>Although the street is not as lively as it used to be, it can be seen that the city is slowly reviving. Some people have died in the catastrophe, others have survived, and new children have grown into adults, generation after generation.</p>
<p>Standing in the street, watching the street crowd in silence, strange people passing by, such as the tide, wave after wave, never stop. He was as like as two peas in the sea. He was born, aged, sick and dead, living quietly in the samsara.</p>
<p>But why should people live?.</p>
<p>Suddenly I thought so.</p>
<p>Both the master and the teacher&rsquo;s wife passed away. They died in front of him. After the pain broke through his heart and lungs, all he had left was numbness and exhaustion.</p>
<p>In this life, he seemed to feel that he was walking a much longer road than others, and this road could not see the end.</p>
<p>He walked away without stopping. There were voices outside him, such as Hawking and shouting. Even if he wanted to, he could hear clearly the voice of a woman teaching a child a block away. However, he felt that he was so far away from himself. In a trance, he felt that he was no longer the man of this world.</p>
<p>Unconsciously, he went to a place, looked up and saw the brand of the restaurant that he had seen before. In the bottom of his heart, he suddenly moved for a moment and could not help but walk in.</p>
<p>There were so few guests in the restaurant that it was clear that business had not recovered from the disaster. The bartender came over and asked with a smile: &ldquo;Sir, do you want to eat or drink?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>There was a moment&rsquo;s silence, but he couldn&rsquo;t speak for a moment. After he came down from Qingyun Mountain, he was in a muddle and could not seem to be able to lift his spirits to anything. That kind of feeling, with a bit of despair, just like ten years ago witnessed Biyao block that sword for him. However, ten years later, he seems to be less crazy, more tired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My guest, my guest?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The bartender&rsquo;s slightly raised voice awakened him. He shook his head and went to a secluded position to sit down.</p>
<p>The bartender followed, still smiling, and said, &ldquo;Sir, what do you want to eat?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here you are&hellip;&rdquo; He spoke slowly, suddenly somewhere deep in his memory. Something flashed, &ldquo;do you still have steamed fish?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The bartender was stunned for a moment and then began to laugh. &ldquo;My guest, were you a regular customer of shanhaiyuan before? This steamed fish was our original specialty, but now we can&rsquo;t eat it.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Ghost Li Zheng for a while, way: &ldquo;this is why?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The bartender shrugged his shoulders. He said: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not to blame those monsters who killed thousands of knives. When the demons occupied here, they suffered a lot within hundreds of miles. Even those fish in the river outside the city were also rolled up and empty. Up to now, it&rsquo;s hard to say that the sleeping fish that can cook is the fry, and it&rsquo;s rare to see one.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>If the ghost Li loses something, I don&rsquo;t know how.</p>
<p>After a long sigh, the waiter remembered the business and asked, &ldquo;my guest, would you like to order some other dishes?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Ghost Li Zheng Zheng looked elsewhere, casually said: &ldquo;forget it, you look at a few kinds of food and wine bar.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The bartender nodded and turned away. Half way to the door, but three people came in at the door. The bartender was surprised. Thinking that today&rsquo;s business is actually getting better, he rushed to meet him. Unexpectedly, the three men only looked at the shop for a moment, and suddenly saw the ghost. One of them called out, with an unexpected voice.</p>
<p>Ghost Li heard strange voice, and the sound sounds a bit familiar, turn around to see, is also a Zheng, so-called the end of the world where do not meet. The three people standing over there are Zhouxian, Xiaohuan and dingou. It&rsquo;s Zhouxian that shouts out.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why, seeing these three people, suddenly there is a burst of kindness in the ghost&rsquo;s heart. Although he is not a close friend, his mood at the moment is really light.</p>
<p>I saw that Monday fairy&rsquo;s face was stunned and disappeared in an instant. Then he was full of laughter and walked quickly over. The cloth curtain of &ldquo;immortal guiding the way&rdquo; hung on the bamboo pole fluttered in the wind, came to the ghost and said with a smile: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s really unexpected that we meet here again.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>A faint smile appeared at the corner of his mouth. Although he disappeared in a blink of an eye, he still said, &ldquo;please sit down, master.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Monday fairy nodded and sat down. The bartender stood aside and asked with laughter, &ldquo;are you all together?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>On Monday, the fairy gave him a look and said, &ldquo;nonsense, can&rsquo;t we sit together?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The bartender nodded repeatedly and said, &ldquo;yes, yes, please take a seat. I&rsquo;ll prepare the food and wine, and I&rsquo;ll be here soon.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>On Monday, the fairy kept laughing, but he pulled over the bartender and ordered seven or eight dishes and three or four pots of wine. The bartender nodded and prepared himself.</p>
<p>One side of the small ring face is not as happy as her grandfather, on the contrary, look at her face black, rather ugly. In particular, seeing that Monday fairy later pulled the waiter to order wine, he was even more gloomy. He wanted to talk for several times, but he still resisted. When the bartender left, she couldn&rsquo;t help but sneer and said, &ldquo;grandfather, you asked for so many dishes. Did you see the rescuer here and want to treat them well?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Zhou Yixian&rsquo;s face sank and said angrily, &ldquo;Xiaohuan, what are you talking about? What kind of friendship do we have with this ghost brother? How can we compare them with wine and vegetables?&rdquo; With that, he turned his head and gave a sharp smile to the ghost. Then he sighed and shook his head: &ldquo;look at this city of Heyang. After the catastrophe, people are not old-fashioned and refuse to look at each other. The world is difficult&hellip;&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Xiao Huan&rsquo;s face changed. He took a fierce look at him, and then glared at Monday fairy. His face was slightly red. However, GUI Li didn&rsquo;t seem to feel anything. He just said, &ldquo;yes, don&rsquo;t worry. I was taken care of by you for many days. This time, I asked you to thank you.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Xiao Huan&rsquo;s face turned red, but Monday fairy was very pleased. He nodded and nodded and said with a smile, &ldquo;yes, it&rsquo;s good. You can teach me something!&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The wild dog Taoist looked at the small ring, and then looked at the ghost, and stopped.</p>
<p>At this time, the bartender brought a few dishes of cold dishes and two pots of wine. Zhou Yixian candidly took the wine pot and filled it for all present. He raised his glass and said, &ldquo;we are all wandering people. It&rsquo;s really a rare fate to meet here, so we&rsquo;ve made this cup.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>After that, he looked up and drank it. Then he shook his head slightly. It seemed that he was quite satisfied with the taste of the wine. Looking at his appearance, the corners of his mouth moved, I don&rsquo;t know if he had a smile, but his facial muscles looked stiff and incomparable. I&rsquo;m afraid that the smile would not show it. He slowly picked up his glass and put it on his lips, just a moment later. He suddenly sighed, with a few helpless pain, as if in his hands. It was the bitterest thing. After drinking, it was slowly put back on the table.</p>
<p>At this time, the little ring sitting next to the immortal on Monday couldn&rsquo;t help but stabbed him with a sentence: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a rare fate. I don&rsquo;t know who is in the street far away to see other people&rsquo;s figure, then shout to catch up to plan to eat free food! &ldquo;.</p>
<p>On Monday, immortal face did not change color, only a white eye small ring way: &ldquo;tongyanwuji, tongyanwuji!&rdquo;.</p>
<p>GUI Li didn&rsquo;t seem to take Xiao Huan&rsquo;s words in his heart. He seemed to have been absent-minded all the time. Xiao Huan had known him for many years, but it was the first time that he saw GUI Li. He didn&rsquo;t feel worried. He couldn&rsquo;t help asking GUI Li, &ldquo;how can you do this? What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>There was a moment&rsquo;s silence. But did not answer small ring, but toward Monday fairy way: &ldquo;master.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Zhou Yixian had just poured himself a glass of wine and said with a smile, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember ten years ago, when I was just a teenager who just came down from Qingyun Mountain, in this Heyang City, did you ever calculate the fate for me?&rdquo; he said in a low voice.</p>
<p>Zhou Yixian and Xiaohuan were both stunned, while Taoist yegou was baffled. Naturally, he knew nothing about the old story. On Monday, Xianwei frowned. After thinking about it, he said, &ldquo;well, I still remember what it looks like. What&rsquo;s the matter. Well, how could you suddenly ask about that year.</p>
<p>Speaking of this, he suddenly showed a mysterious look on his face, lowered his voice and said to the ghost: &ldquo;you should not say that after ten years, we didn&rsquo;t calculate well and planned to ask for fortune telling money back then?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grandfather Xiao Huan was angry with Zhou Xian, which seemed to be unbearable. Maybe, what&rsquo;s wrong with you You can tell me about it. &ldquo;.</p>
<p>GUI Li took a look at the little ring. In his tired eyes, he rarely showed a warm feeling. But he still gently shook his head and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m nothing. I just want to ask the old man a few words.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Monday fairy cleaned up his clothes and coughed. At that time, the air of ancient fairies gushed out. For a moment, this small restaurant seemed to be full of splendor, and he was the only one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me.&rdquo; He said faintly, &ldquo;with your and my friendship, you can say nothing, but life money should still be given to you.&rdquo; At the end, he blinked at the ghost, regardless of the red face of the little ring nearby.</p>
<p>GUI Li gave a faint smile and patted it with some consolation. Because he was conscious of losing his face to the little ring which was about to break out, he turned to Zhouxian, showing a bit of perplexity on his face, and said: &ldquo;master, you have played in the world, you have extraordinary knowledge. I have one thing, confused in my heart. Please tell me, elder, why do we come here when we live?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This speech a, small ring and wild dog are a Zheng, look at the ghost Li have puzzled color. But Monday fairy frowned, the banter on his face gradually faded, and his expression became solemn. He did not answer, but after pondering for a long time, he slowly said, &ldquo;you look abnormal. You are not as good as you used to say, but have you met anything unpleasant?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>After a moment&rsquo;s silence, GUI Li said in a low voice, &ldquo;my teacher and teacher&rsquo;s wife have passed away before.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah Xiaohuan and the wild dog Taoist were both surprised and cried out. Zhouxian frowned, sighed, and whispered, &ldquo;is it a pity that Tian is not easy to go?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>He closed his eyes slightly, then looked as usual, and said, &ldquo;no wonder you have pain on your face. It&rsquo;s human nature that you just leave in life and death. No one can avoid it. You are not ordinary people. Why should you indulge in it?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The pain on his face was more severe, and he said, &ldquo;but the two of them died, and I really have something to do with it!&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this case, when your master&rsquo;s wife passed away, did you have any resentment against you?&rdquo; the immortal said faintly.</p>
<p>After a long time, he said slowly, &ldquo;no, my teacher and teacher&rsquo;s wife have been so kind to me that they still remember me and take me back to the door before they die&hellip;&rdquo; After that, it was choking.</p>
<p>The small ring beside looked at the ghostly appearance, imperceptibly her eye socket also red.</p>
<p>Monday fairy smile, eyes light light flow, as if to jump out of this mundane world, see through the world, said: &ldquo;then I ask you again, when your Shifu Shiniang passed away, do you have any regret?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>He hesitated for a moment and shook his head slowly.</p>
<p>Monday fairy said with a smile, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s it. You should have been happy for them. It&rsquo;s not their best fate to die without regret?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>GUI Li raised his head and looked at Zhou Xian, his lips moved slightly, and his expression was perplexed. (to be continued. )</p>
