      <p>As time goes by, the overwhelming sword rain has already rushed to the beast God, and the strong wind blows on his face. At the same time, the figure of the beast god suddenly disappeared and disappeared in the black air. On the contrary, the evil spirit of the beast under him was full of black gas and jumped up. The skeleton of his whole body made a sound. Under the black air, it was even more terrible.</p>
<p>The monster roared up to the sky, exhaled and opened his voice. In an instant, the wind and cloud changed color. The ground under his feet was sand flying stones, and he could hardly stand a man. In the wind and cloud, the black air was surging, and it was integrated with the evil spirit and monster. In an instant, it expanded more than three times. Dozens of prominent black gas appeared on the white bones of the evil spirit beast, flying in the air like tentacles.</p>
<p>At this time, the sky Zhuxian sword rain has already arrived. The thousand year sword array is not idle. The black air from the outside is surging up. Before it reaches the front, it is completely destroyed by the sword Qi, without even leaving any trace. It rushes down again and goes straight to the ferocious beast.</p>
<p>The evil spirit roared and howled incessantly. Seeing that the fierce sword rain was about to hit the huge evil spirit, suddenly, dozens of black air like the tentacles of living creatures suddenly flew up and met them. The black air covered the clouds and blocked the way of the Qi sword.</p>
<p>Zhuxian sword Qi rushed down in a flash and fought with these strange black air tentacles. However, the tentacles made of these black gas were not as vulnerable as the black air outside the talent, nor as rigid as the shield controlled by the beast God at first. More than 100 Zhuxian Qi swords rushed down. These tentacles were like living creatures, and they were entangled in a mass, and their castration gradually slowed down, which was the brilliance of the sword , actually also slowly wear away, gradually dim.</p>
<p>However, after all, the sword of killing immortals is not a mortal thing. Although it is transformed by invisible Qi, in order to dissolve these Qi swords, the black air tentacles around can still be clearly seen that they were hurt by the sharp light of immortal Qi and transpiration a lot. However, from the evil spirit, the black gas gushed out from the evil spirit and made up for it in a twinkling of an eye. After a while, more than a hundred swords are earthshaking. They were all dissolved in the invisible.</p>
<p>On the Tongtian peak of Qingyun Mountain, there is no sound like death.</p>
<p>In the air, daoxuan&rsquo;s face is more dignified. However, he was fearless. His figure like a fairyland stood in the clouds, holding a brilliant ancient sword for killing immortals, just like the appearance of ancient immortals.</p>
<p>But see him cold smile, right hand holds sword to stab the sky.</p>
<p>Slowly waving, along with the ancient sword Zhuxian sword shining bright, the sky began to faint thunder sound, the whole sky, rumbling, momentum of Zhuxian sword array rotating together, especially the colorful main sword is full of light, can not be seen.</p>
<p>Suddenly, from the sky, a white sword. Straight into the Zhuxian sword array, the purple air swords gathered within ten Zhangs of the square; then, the other six colors of brilliance rose one by one, shining brightly and flying into the sky. In an instant, seven star positions were formed in the Zhuxian sword array, each of which was a huge monochromatic sword array, which was majestic.</p>
<p>The wind and the wind are howling and hunting.</p>
<p>The silent place suddenly a thunder, roaring and roaring. As if thousands of people&rsquo;s hearts were shaking, the sky&rsquo;s swords flowed, the color was shining, and countless colorful air swords crossed the sky. He screamed down.</p>
<p>Like the raging tide of the sky, rushing forward, purple gas in the first place, you can&rsquo;t see the boundary at a glance, which is much more powerful than just now. And behind the purple, every ten feet. Then there was the same color of sword Qi coming together. It was surging and roaring, which was beyond the imagination of human beings.</p>
<p>Looking at this is almost destroying the sky and the earth in general, no one does not change color, palms sweat.</p>
<p>Mingled with the huge thunder and howling in the sky, the old and clumsy singing gradually disappeared, and even those strange sounds of beating drums had already disappeared. But the huge evil spirit, in the face of the terrible sword rain and raging waves, is resolute and unrelenting, but seeing the rising of black gas, it is even more fierce and howling, like a provocation to the heaven, extremely rebellious.</p>
<p>In a twinkling of an eye, dozens of black air tentacles sprang up. Rao Shi, this sword spirit is not the same as that of the right person. However, the ancient witchcraft of Nanman is actually a marvelous skill. The black air tentacle is more and more brave. Although the innumerable Qi swords stabbed thousands of holes in a flash, it seems that the endless black air is mended in an instant, and the largest scope is actually expanded, As far as tens of Zhang.</p>
<p>But at first, this wave of purple air sword rushed into the black air, and the black air pressure was forced down. However, after a moment, the black air had turned back and rose, and swallowed the air sword one by one. Rao is so. Before the black gas returns to its original state, the second wave of Qi sword array has already rushed to the front.</p>
<p>In the sky, the swords were like rain, like locusts, dense and dense. With the real Dharma of daoxuan, the ancient Zhuxian sword was more and more shining. The colorful main sword in the air was more and more monochromatic Qi swords, and the separation speed was faster and faster. Wave after wave formed a thrilling huge sword array, which suddenly cut down the black air.</p>
<p>Under the fierce attack of Zhuxian sword array, the black spirit was no longer as arrogant as it was at the beginning. It was gradually oppressed from the first few tens of feet. However, the black air gradually ceased to flow when the wave was stronger than one and almost endless. The huge evil spirits and monsters still roar, but the black air around them is gradually weak. Each wave of sword rain is closer to itself than the previous wave. The black air is becoming thin, and the weird tentacles are gradually weak. It is more and more difficult to resist the sword rain all over the sky.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know when to start, after a long silence, the crowd broke out like a tidal wave of cheers.</p>
<p>The last six black air tentacles, after barely withstanding a wave of green sword Qi, finally dissipated and disappeared into invisibility, leaving only the huge evil spirit in the air.</p>
<p>The world is solemn and the sword spirit is vertical and horizontal!</p>
<p>Ancient song, boundless wilderness!</p>
<p>Like thunder, like lightning, the infinite sword fell from the sky and rushed from all directions to pierce the huge evil spirits in the air.</p>
<p>The huge white bones burst in an instant, countless black blood splashed away, and the evil spirits suddenly raised their heads and sent out a piercing roar to the sky.</p>
<p>The wind dissipated and the clouds dispersed.</p>
<p>The sword rain stopped.</p>
<p>Among the thousands of eyes, the huge body of the evil spirit, every inch of skin and skeleton, seems to be shaking gently. Looking at it, countless small swords shining into every place, from the beginning to the end, from top to bottom, there is no complete place.</p>
<p>People took a breath of cool air on Tongtian peak, I don&rsquo;t know why. There was a faint tingling sensation on the back.</p>
<p>However, it seems that the evil spirit has not died yet. It is full of the huge head of the Qi sword of Zhu Xian and slowly turns around. Looked at his body full of holes, and slowly lowered his head. Its voice, somehow, was no longer shrill and ferocious, and now it seemed to be very low, as if to part with it. It&rsquo;s more painful.</p>
<p>The mouth opened and closed, and two red awns flashed in its eyes, like a flame. It tried to burn, but it was finally destroyed and dissipated.</p>
<p>At the next moment, in mid air, a loud noise suddenly burst out from the huge body of the evil spirit. It rang through the heaven and earth, and countless air swords flew upside down, even the immortal killing sword array on the sky. It&rsquo;s also a mess.</p>
<p>Then, the once invincible huge evil spirit suddenly became extremely fragile. After the strong wind, the indestructible skeleton body, like sand and stone, broke down, white bones turned into sand, flesh and blood into stone, and dispersed with the wind.</p>
<p>People stare at the sky in silence. When this victory is in sight, no one cheers, as if there is a strange feeling, enveloped in the hearts of all.</p>
<p>In the sky. The once huge body was about to disperse completely with the wind. Suddenly, a cry came from the feet, and then all the people screamed out. In the body of the monster, although the flesh and blood bones were all gone, there was still a mass of black gas, which was still moving slowly in the air. After a moment, the body of the evil spirit was completely destroyed, and the black air slowly dispersed to reveal the scene.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, he was in the shape of a young man, the animal God who suddenly lost sight. However, the beast God at the moment is no longer as natural and unrestrained as it was just now. Instead, he looks very embarrassed. Especially, his originally gorgeous silk clothes have become riddled with holes, which are turned into fly ash by the strong wind in the sky.</p>
<p>For a moment, he was naked, but there was no look of fear and disappointment on his face. On the contrary, he gazed at the vast array of swords in front of him. Suddenly, he smiles, stretches his body, and stands in the air and says, &ldquo;great, great!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan&rsquo;s face changed. Obviously, he didn&rsquo;t expect that the beast God would be so difficult to resist. In the face of such a situation just now, he could still resist it. At first glance, he was more pale and tired. Looking around, he didn&rsquo;t even have a wound.</p>
<p>At the foot of my feet, there was a burst of noise, but many female disciples of Qingyun Mountain woke up at the moment, pink and afraid to look at the sky. On the contrary, although the beast God was naked, he didn&rsquo;t care at all, as if the heaven and earth had just opened. He just looked at the ancient sword in the hands of immortal daoxuan to kill the immortals.</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan sneered and said, &ldquo;if you surrender at this moment and promise to abolish your Taoist practice and practice good deeds again in the dreamy moon cave behind the green clouds, I will spare your life.</p>
<p>Otherwise, you will not be killed by the sword. &quot;</p>
<p>After that, he held the ancient sword of killing immortals and waved it gently. As if the sword was sensed all over the sky, it shook together with awe inspiring momentum. But at this moment, a trace of pain flashed on the ground. Although it flashed, it had already fallen into the eyes of the beast God.</p>
<p>The beast God stood in the air, his eyes were bright, but his mouth showed a smile. &ldquo;Such a fierce sword, coupled with the spirit of the green mountains below, you can support it up to now, and you haven&rsquo;t seen any decline. It&rsquo;s really comparable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taoist priest frowned and said in a deep voice, &ldquo;what do you mean by that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The beast God laughed but did not answer. He only shook his head and said, &ldquo;the fierce spirit of the ancient sword must be the result of the evil spirit of heaven and earth. It has the same origin as me. How can I not know? You fight with me by force, but the victory or defeat is unknown, but most of you are driven by the sword spirit. You are not ordinary people. Why should I say more about such things that harm others and harm yourself? &ldquo;Hey, hey,&rdquo; the beast God sneered and said, &ldquo;I advise you to give up the sword early, or else the sword spirit will bite back in the future, and you will end up a thousand times worse than me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan gazed at the beast God for a long time, then shook his head and laughed. His eyes were filled with disdain. He said, &ldquo;demon, how can you understand the benevolence of Taoism! What&rsquo;s more, what&rsquo;s more, I&rsquo;m a Taoist Dharma without the supreme sword. Is that what you&rsquo;re talking about can make it clear? &quot;</p>
<p>With a clear cry, he shook his arms, and his sword Qi trembled all over the sky, and said: &ldquo;demon, die!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The beast God sneered, and his eyes flashed like a flame. He said, &ldquo;OK, today I&rsquo;ll show you the magic of Southern Xinjiang.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as the words fell, the black breath suddenly flashed from his naked skin. In a moment, the originally white skin was completely like black ink, but under the skin, it began to shake. Numerous small protuberances, like life, began to shake.</p>
<p>In the remote and unknown land, the vast wilderness in all directions, suddenly came the extremely deep &ldquo;Dong Dong&rdquo; strange sound. It&rsquo;s like the heartbeat of a human being. Looking at the sky, beyond the brilliant light of the Zhuxian sword array, the sky suddenly darkened, and black clouds poured in from all directions. Quickly gathered around the beast God.</p>
<p>Daoxuan was dignified, alert and staring at the strange changes ahead.</p>
<p>In the dark air, it seems that the deep and strange sound coming from the nether world is getting faster and denser. People can&rsquo;t help but feel that their heart beat faster and faster. Finally, it seems that they are going to burst. A few righteous disciples with lower Taoism can&rsquo;t resist it and have to fall to the ground. Use your power to resist.</p>
<p>In the middle of the sky, with the black air getting thicker and thicker, suddenly, there was a low growl, such as the roar of an evil beast, and like a strange insect breaking out of its cocoon. People can see clearly that the black body of the beast God burst from the skin of his left arm, and in the countless small bumps constantly beating at the bottom of his skin. Slowly stretched out another thing, has the hand to have the finger, actually is another arm appearance, moreover this new arm. The bones are strong, far larger than their own arms, and it is impossible to imagine how this actually extended from the original arm.</p>
<p>However, this is just the beginning, with a deep burst sound, the body of the beast God seems to burst in every place, from which a variety of new huge trunk limbs are born. And it didn&rsquo;t take long. On top of these new limbs, they burst apart again, and new and bigger limbs were born again.</p>
<p>The people on Tongtian peak changed their color and looked at each other with astonishment. Such a strange and incomparable witchcraft was not only unheard of, but also unheard of. For thousands of years in the Middle Earth, no one has ever recorded such thrilling miracles.</p>
<p>Even at the moment, immortal daoxuan couldn&rsquo;t help but take a breath. He looked at the animal God in front of him in the shape of an ordinary boy. At the moment, it seemed that it was expanding. When he finally stopped to split, he stood in front of the immortal killing sword array. It was a monster with a height of ten feet and a hundred heads.</p>
<p>Tongtian peak back mountain, magic moon cave boundary.</p>
<p>At the moment, the purple air column rising from the cave is still the same, without any signs of exhaustion. From a distance, the air column is like a solid body, with auspicious vapor and solemn solemnity.</p>
<p>At the moment, most of the sky above the sky is full of Qi Jian array. Even though it is far away from here, GUI Li and Lin Jingyu can feel the surging ancient sword&rsquo;s power of killing immortals.</p>
<p>Holding back the trembling dragon sword in his hand, Lin Jingyu takes back his eyes from the sky. He is shocked by the power of the ancient sword to kill immortals. At the same time, his mood changes slightly.</p>
<p>Just now, he and GUI Li were almost on the verge of making a decision on life and death. Suddenly, the sword array of killing immortals was launched, which made them shocked. They both stopped at the same time.</p>
<p>But said, only afraid that stands in front of oneself person, at this moment mood is more complex? Lin Jingyu did not know how, the idea flashed in his heart and turned his head to the ghost.</p>
<p>That one, looks like has experienced the vicissitudes of life the man, looks up at the sky silently, that splendid, the shocking myriad weather.</p>
<p>The world is silent. The wind from afar seems to be the sound of many years ago. There is also a picture in my mind that has echoed countless times in the past ten years, and every time I think about it, I feel sad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ding Ding Bell&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>Secluded, such as the sound of wind bell gently shaking in the breeze, whose smile looks back in the bell, once the pale green figure and the gentle body with warmth, that little residual temperature, who knows can warm these years, how many desolate and indifferent night he has had?</p>
<p>The deepest cold, from the heart of the cold, rushed up to the heart, cold heart, cold body, from the fingers to the heart, as if no longer feel a trace of pain, but suddenly found that the original time has turned into a sharp blade, cutting all the time.</p>
<p>But no blood!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Biyao&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He gently read a sentence, body do not know how, began to shake gently. In his eyes, twinkling reflected in the sky that brilliant thousands of swords, almost not like the human scene. The countless sword lights galloping freely, each of which is so natural and unrestrained, can be vividly seen, reminding the past memories.</p>
<p>That green figure, as if standing beside him, like ten years ago, facing all people, never retreat, never regret!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoa&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>With his eyes wide open and his hands clenched into fists, he let out a low &ldquo;cluck&rdquo; sound. As if sensing the master&rsquo;s anger, the soul swallowing slowly flew up. On the black surface of the whole body, the dark red stripes as thin as blood vessels lit up one by one, reflecting in the ghost&rsquo;s eyes, and gradually dyed his eyes with blood red color.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zheng!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clear sword Yin, startled him, ghost Li slowly turned his head, a pair of blood red eyes, saw the face of Lin Jingyu sneering and disdain in front of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are really hopeless!&rdquo; Lin Jingyu said decidedly: &ldquo;I should have known that if you fall into the devil&rsquo;s road, it will be difficult to turn back. Unfortunately, I still care about the old love and hope you can turn back. Well, today, on this Qingyun Mountain, we&rsquo;ll make a break! &quot;</p>
<p>He looked at him for a long time, then laughed, and the laughter gradually became crazy, full of arrogance and disdain.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu was very angry. He drank furiously and drew the sword formula. At that time, the blue light rose sharply. The sword of cutting dragon was like a green dragon, and it soared into the sky. In a flash, a strong wind blows in front of the magic moon cave. Lin Jingyu flies up with his magic sword in his hand. He is handsome and natural in white. He is really like a dragon and Phoenix in a human being. But at the moment, the murderous spirit in his eyes was as fierce as ghost.</p>
<p>In the middle of the sky, the dragon sword has already been cut off. Although it is quite far away, the sword is surging forward like a green dragon. It shoots a deep groove on the ground and rushes straight to the ghost.</p>
<p>The face of the ghost is still so crazy, some ferocious look, watching the green light come, suddenly the body is like a ghost general, instantly disappear.</p>
<p>The sword of the Dragon chopping sword was cut down and hit the place where GUI Li was originally standing. At that time, the hard rock in the ground was smashed into pieces, and Shengsheng made a big hole.</p>
<p>At the next moment, the ghostly and strange figure suddenly appeared in front of Lin Jingyu, and the soul eating magic wand came out in a roar. The red light was shining, and the strong wind was blowing on his face. Generally speaking, he had no intention to keep his hand.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu was frightened but not disordered. He pulled out his body abruptly and avoided the attack of the potential. He turned back to control the sword and rushed up. With a long smile, he did not dodge, but came face-to-face. The Soul Eater flew back to his hand like lightning and rushed to Lin Jingyu.</p>
<p>Two childhood playmates glared at each other like this, fighting for life and death.</p>
<p>Like an arrow from the string, flying into the air!</p>
<p>In an instant, the strong wind around suddenly rises, with two people in the air as the center, and the invisible sound waves flow outward. The trees close to each other are uprooted and fly upside down.</p>
<p>In the center of the storm, a trace of pain flashed on their faces, and a faint golden awn was seen on their fierce faces.</p>
<p>This duel happened at the back of Tongtian peak. When the wind blows over the mountains and reaches the distance, it is already light and hard to hear. What&rsquo;s more, who cares about them now?</p>
<p>In the sky, there is a more important fight!</p>
<p>However, in the crowd, I do not know why, Lu Xueqi suddenly body a shock, the face is quite strange, there is a light gold light flash past.</p>
<p>She turned back in amazement. Her body was a little stiff. She looked out into the distance. It was a remote and lonely place behind the mountain (to be continued. )</p>
