      <p>Zhou Yixian and other three were shocked. In this gloomy night, they only felt that their backs were like thorns and their hair was standing up. A faint green fire in that room was burning quietly, and the light was slowly emanating from the cracks of the house. It was strange and unpredictable. With the sound of the night wind around, it was more and more like the sound of ghost crying.</p>
<p>However, when they thought they had been discovered by the people in the room, the dark green fire was still after it was lit up, and there was no further reaction. The three people did not dare to take a breath out of the atmosphere outside the house. For a long time, after it was determined that the dark green fire was not lit up because of them, they were relieved In the heart of fear, there is some curiosity.</p>
<p>Zhou Yixian frowned and pondered for a moment. He made a gesture to Xiao Huan and the wild dog Taoist. Then he walked quietly to the side of the room. The mansion was dilapidated for many years. He could easily find a gap, and then he attached himself to it and looked carefully into the middle of the room. Meanwhile, Xiao Huan and Taoist wild dog came along and looked down at his side.</p>
<p>In the middle of the dark room, there was a dark green light at the moment, but the fire was not an oil lamp flame. It was a small light hanging in the middle of the house, burning quietly like a flame. But there is no ghost in the room, just under the light of green light, a broken coffin looks particularly creepy.</p>
<p>Outside, Xiao Huan&rsquo;s face turned pale. She bit her lower lip. She raised her eyes and saw that on the altar table in the day, the spirit tablet of Zhou Xingyun, the son of Zhouxian, was still standing on the table, and other magic cards were as rickety as in the daytime. It was obvious that Mr. ghost was here, but he had no interest in them.</p>
<p>Next to Monday fairy also relaxed at this time, it seems that also saw the son&rsquo;s spiritual position safe and sound, put down his heart. The little ring lowered the voice. &ldquo;Grandfather, what should I do now?&rdquo; he said softly</p>
<p>Zhou Yixian was not a chivalrous and righteous person. He ventured to come here tonight for the sake of his son&rsquo;s spiritual position. Since he knew that Mr. GUI was not interested in this spiritual position and his son was safe and sound, he would not like to stay more. Besides, it was a place not suitable for Zhou Daxian. No, I miss my family&rsquo;s practice.</p>
<p>After making up his mind, Monday fairy turned back and whispered, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Huan and the wild dog both nodded. They were about to turn around and leave. However, at this time, Monday fairy relaxed and didn&rsquo;t pay attention to his steps. When he turned around, he kicked something like a stick under the ground. He kicked it out of the courtyard and made a big noise.</p>
<p>All three people&rsquo;s bodies froze. &ldquo;Grandfather!&rdquo; said Xiao Huan angrily</p>
<p>Monday fairy was embarrassed and was about to say something to explain. Suddenly, he heard a cold hum behind his back, which was as cold as the bone. The broken wall behind the three suddenly collapsed. The dark and green light poured out from the middle of the house, and it was about to cover them.</p>
<p>Zhou Yixian&rsquo;s face changed greatly. He suddenly raised his hand, waved the Yellow charm, and said in a hurry: &ldquo;go</p>
<p>The voice dropped. His lips moved rapidly, and a series of strange tones came out of his mouth. A moment later, at the moment when the green light touched his body, the yellow paper amulet in the hands of Monday immortal was stimulated by the incantation method. A burst of earthy yellow light flashed by, and the shadow of the immortal disappeared out of thin air on Monday.</p>
<p>Almost at the same time, in the dark of the mansion, a voice suddenly &ldquo;Yi&rdquo; with a sense of surprise. However, although the fairy escaped quickly on Monday, the green light came in a twinkling of an eye. Xiao Huan&rsquo;s mantra was only half recited, not to mention the wild dog Taoist priest. At this critical moment, the incantation that had been strongly remembered seemed to suddenly disappear from his mind. He was so stunned that he could not recite a word. He just waved the Yellow Rune paper helplessly and opened his mouth a few times, which was quite funny.</p>
<p>The green light rushed up and enveloped them. For a moment, an extremely cold breath pierced into the body from all directions. Xiao Huan and Taoist wild dog felt that their blood seemed to freeze up in an instant, and they could no longer resist. At the moment, there was a strong force in the deep of the room. In the faint green light, the two people&rsquo;s figures were absorbed by the whole body I can&rsquo;t resist at all.</p>
<p>A moment later, only two bangs were heard. It was thought that the bodies of Xiao Huan and wild dog Taoist priest fell on the floor of the house. But somehow, they did not make any more sound. Suddenly, inside and outside the house, they fell into a dead silence.</p>
<p>The night was long, cold and silent. There was silence inside and outside the house. There was a faint mist floating in the darkness of the night, which made people see it unreal. Only a little dark fire in the room was still silent and bright, which reminded us that there was a strange existence here.</p>
<p>Xiao Huan and wild dog Taoist have been sucked into the house by the strange green light for a long time, but since then, no sound has been transmitted from the middle of the room, and the only one of the three who escaped, Zhouxian, has disappeared. Time in this silence, minutes and seconds passed, as if the people in this room are also particularly patient, waiting quietly.</p>
<p>In silence, a figure suddenly appeared from the door of the villa. It was Zhou Xian. His face was frowning. He seemed to be hesitant. But he shook his head and sighed. He walked slowly towards the shady house.</p>
<p>When he arrived at the gate of the house of the underworld, he did not wait for him to think about it. The door of the mansion suddenly &ldquo;squeaked&rdquo; and opened automatically. The faint green light inside shone silently on the body of Monday immortal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in, please.&rdquo; There was a dull voice without any emotion in the middle of the room.</p>
<p>Monday, the immortal calmed down, went in and looked around. Soon, he found that Xiaohuan and the wild dog Taoist priest were lying on the ground beside the offering table. It seemed that there was no flesh wound on his body. However, they both looked at themselves with wide eyes. Their mouths moved a few times, but there was no sound. It was very strange. I don&rsquo;t know whether they were treated by some strange methods Yes.</p>
<p>The most striking thing in the room was the dark green fire hanging in the air. It was burning above the coffin that Monday immortal had noticed during the day. In the coffin below it, Mr. ghost&rsquo;s voice without emotion was heard at the moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tu Dun&rsquo;s strange skill&rdquo; has been lost for many years. I can&rsquo;t imagine that I can see you again today. I don&rsquo;t know where you are</p>
<p>Monday immortal was silent for a moment. He looked at the coffin and said in a deep voice: &ldquo;they are young and ignorant. Your excellency is a unique person. Don&rsquo;t you have to haggle with them? &quot;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost said faintly: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t dare to be. I&rsquo;m just a ghost. I can&rsquo;t afford to be called a peerless person. During the day I have told you not to come here again, but you have broken my ban. What is the reason for this? &quot;</p>
<p>The immortal&rsquo;s eyes fluttered on Monday and said slowly, &ldquo;this is the place where my dead son&rsquo;s spiritual position is located, and the place where my soul lives. You are a person in the path of ghosts. How can I rest assured?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a pause in Mr. ghost&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<p>After a while, he said word by word: &ldquo;how do you know that I am a ghost?&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Monday, the immortal said: &ldquo;you settle down in the place of the Yin House, sleep in the most Yin cave, and use the&rdquo; ghost fire &ldquo;to absorb the dark and ghost Qi of the one hundred year old Yizhuang&rsquo;s Yin House, and repair yourself. Such profound ghost skills can&rsquo;t be used by those who have been steeped in the ghost world for a long time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost was silent for a long time, and said, &ldquo;you are indeed an expert. You are disrespectful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhou Yixian&rsquo;s face was rarely serious, and said, &ldquo;you are also an understanding person. Naturally, you know what I am worried about? Although the dead son died for many years. But I can&rsquo;t let him die or be peaceful. However, it seems that you are not abusing the supernatural powers to make characters. I am relieved. &quot;</p>
<p>After that, Zhouxian actually bowed down to the coffin. Mr. ghost snorted coldly, and his tone was cold. He said, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t have to flatter me like this. Naturally, I won&rsquo;t do such a dirty thing as to arrest people&rsquo;s soul. But you are going to violate my ban. But it can&rsquo;t escape the blame. &quot;</p>
<p>As soon as Zhou Yixian&rsquo;s face changed, he coughed and said, &ldquo;well, actually, this is a misunderstanding! Your excellency is a unique person. Why&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>For a moment, mister, the ghost of the bright green policy, a moment of delay, the ghost of the sky. On Monday, the immortal&rsquo;s face was bitter, watching the ghost fire.</p>
<p>The green light flickered and the ghost fire grew bigger. When the size of the fist grows to the size of a fist, the whole room is covered with green light. Even the small ring and wild dog Taoist priest lying on the ground have already been reflected green.</p>
<p>Suddenly, I just heard a slight bang, and the green light swayed. The ghost fire split away in an instant, from one to five, divided into five parts, and then a number of dark red lights shot out of the green light, connected with each other, and became a weird five-star array. In the air, layers of gloomy ghost gas came out.</p>
<p>Zhou Yixian&rsquo;s face was dignified, his pupils contracted slightly, and his forehead seemed to have sweat.</p>
<p>When the strange array was gradually taking shape on the opposite side, Monday immortal meditated a little, stepped back two steps, and took out several yellow paper symbols from his arms. He could not help saying that he first pasted four pieces of paper on his body, and then pasted several pieces on the ground, on the chair, and on the edge of the gravel. It looked like a mess, but there was a faint echo among them.</p>
<p>Just as Monday immortal had just set up his array, the mysterious array there had already taken shape. As time went by, the five-star array flashed with strange light. In an instant, the whole mansion was filled with the sound of ghosts crying and howling.</p>
<p>Zhou Yixian was shocked and lost his voice: &ldquo;ghost howling and breaking!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost&rsquo;s whistling sound seemed invisible, but it seemed invincible. From above the array, a sharp edge broke through the air. Along the way, gravel and wood flew at the touch, and even the hard stone slab was deeply dented.</p>
<p>On Monday, the fairy&rsquo;s white hair fluttered, his hands stretched rapidly, and his two yellow talismans stuck to his ears. Suddenly, he felt pain on his face, and then he said something in his mouth. With his right hand holding the sword finger stabbing paper symbol, he suddenly opened his eyes and paid attention to the ghost&rsquo;s roaring wind.</p>
<p>In a moment, the ghost scream collided with Zhou Yixian&rsquo;s body. Almost at the same time, all the four paper symbols on Monday immortal&rsquo;s body and those on the yellow paper amulet under the ground were all lit up, and quickly condensed into a blue light to block him in front of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boom</p>
<p>With a loud noise, Monday fairy&rsquo;s body flew out and hit heavily on the debris behind him and fell down. In the shady house, yellow charms are flying all over the sky, and they are scattered helplessly. At the same time, the five dark fires above the coffin of Mr. ghost are once again condensed into one and are still burning.</p>
<p>Monday fairy gasped, struggled on the ground for two times, slowly got up, and said with a bitter smile, &ldquo;I am an old bone, do you really want to let go of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. GUI was silent for a moment and said, &ldquo;your vision, experience and insight are all extraordinary, but how can you be so humble in practicing Taoism?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Monday immortal reached out to wipe a faint thread of blood from his mouth and said calmly, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter with the low level of Taoism? There are so many people who are keen on cultivating Taoism, and so many people with profound Taoism. How many people are happier than me</p>
<p>This time, Mr. ghost was silent for a long time, and then he did not hear him. He saw that the ghost fire suddenly shook, and then he quickly flew to the little ring and the wild dog Taoist priest lying on the side. Stop over them.</p>
<p>Monday fairy was very surprised. He was worried, but he saw the ghost fire circling around the two, and then flew back to Mr. ghost&rsquo;s coffin, and a moment later. I don&rsquo;t know what the reason is. Xiao Huan and the wild dog Taoist priest moved, and at the same time, they called out softly. Then they got up. It seems that it was Mr. ghost who untied the ban on them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you very much, sir. We&rsquo;ll go now. We&rsquo;ll go now. We won&rsquo;t come after killing us.</p>
<p>&quot;</p>
<p>After that, he winked at Xiao Huan and the wild dog Taoist. Naturally, both of them were eager to leave early. They nodded repeatedly. However, just as they were about to leave, Mr. ghost&rsquo;s voice suddenly rang out coldly and said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to spare you by letting them go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All three were surprised, and Monday fairy said in surprise, &ldquo;what do you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost snorted coldly and said, &ldquo;you three have come here to explore my news again and again. You know that my ghost way is secret, which is a big crime to me. Now let the three of you deal with me together and let you die without complaint. &quot;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan and others are pale. Zhouxian had a hand with him just now, and knew that this man&rsquo;s moral conduct was unfathomable. Unable to resist, he had to murmur: &ldquo;you are an expert. You should know that we have no malice. We are only worried about the spirit of the dead son being harassed by others, so we can&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before he finished speaking, Mr. ghost suddenly said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t say it. Look at the fire</p>
<p>Before the words fell, the ghost fire in the air had already lit up again, and the ghost spirit was flourishing again. On Monday, the immortal&rsquo;s face changed, and there was still something to say, but the ghost fire turned into a five-star array, and a scream was heard. It was just the invincible ghost howl that was sent out again and rushed over.</p>
<p>With a cry, the wild dog Taoist priest rushed to the front to block in front of the small ring. The beast tooth magic weapon was offered and blocked in front of the body. On Monday, Xianji said, &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t stop it. Get out of the way&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, the speed of the ghost howling was several times faster than that just now. In a flash, he rushed to the wild dog Taoist. In an instant, he felt that the strong wind was cutting his face like a knife, especially his ears were stinging. The whole man was exposed to a thousand sharp blades, and he was allowed to be slaughtered.</p>
<p>Xiao Huan screamed and panicked behind him. He just wanted to help, but the strong wind came from the side of the wild dog, and the ghost howled suddenly. Xiaohuan could not retreat and could not avoid it. He was about to be hurt by the evil spirit. At this critical juncture, suddenly, there was a light whistling outside the house, and something flashed black and green, like electricity, flew to Xiaohuan and wild dogs. A black stick, which seemed dull and blunt but had no edge, was gently doing everything from top to bottom. All of a sudden, the originally terrifying ghost howl disappeared, and the wind in the room gradually calmed down.</p>
<p>The little ring, who had just wandered around from the gate of ghosts, suddenly turned his head. He was overjoyed and cried, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s you&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>And almost at the same time, the ghost gradually merged into one, and Mr. ghost said coldly, &ldquo;is it you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Someone outside the door said faintly, &ldquo;yes, it&rsquo;s me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the voice, a man slowly walked in, long clothes negative hand, shoulder lying on a three eyed gray monkey, it is fierce.</p>
<p>GUI Li took a look at Xiao Huan and other three people. He saw that Xiao Huan looked at himself with a smile and full of joy, while Taoist wild dog looked a little strange. He looked at himself a few times and slowly stepped back to one side.</p>
<p>GUI Li was a little strange in his heart, but he didn&rsquo;t think much about it. He walked slowly to the middle of the room, and the magic wand flickered and flew back to his hand.</p>
<p>Monday immortal looked at the ghost and looked at Xiao Huan&rsquo;s appearance. He suddenly snorted and said, &ldquo;you son of a bitch, you should have been around this long time ago. You didn&rsquo;t do it early. Knowing that my old man is old and weak, he even let me face this ghost. It&rsquo;s really a sinister thing you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan frowned, glared at the immortal Monday, called out a lot of blame, said: &ldquo;grandfather!&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li didn&rsquo;t seem to care. He looked at him and said, &ldquo;if not, I don&rsquo;t know you have something to do with the old ancestor of Qingyun Mountain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhou Yixian&rsquo;s face changed and he snorted. He stopped talking to him. He turned slowly and faced the silent coffin.</p>
<p>Mr. ghost&rsquo;s voice sounded slowly and said, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t have a good look at Biyao in Huqi mountain. Why are you here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Staring at the coffin, he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to ask you, what are you doing here when you&rsquo;re not in the wild temple?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. GUI was silent for a moment and said, &ldquo;no matter what, you and I are all the characters in the ghost King clan. These three people are taboo to me. I want to get rid of them. Why do you stop me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhou Yixian listened to it in the back. Somehow, the voice seemed to be much louder at the moment. He said in a loud voice, &ldquo;bah, you can kill a pig if you want to kill it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan and the wild dog Taoist both looked sideways at him for a moment. Monday fairy frowned, and seemed to feel that he was not right. He murmured a few words in a low voice and calmed down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t kill them,&rdquo; he said coldly to the coffin in front of him</p>
<p>Mr. ghost snorted coldly and said, &ldquo;why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m here,&rdquo; he said</p>
<p>After a long time, Mr. Murphy asked for a cold shoulder</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am, you can&rsquo;t kill them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a light of joy on the immortal&rsquo;s face on Monday. Xiaohuan was staring at the ghost&rsquo;s back behind him. His teeth bit his lower lip, and his eyes were very bright. Only the wild dog Taoist didn&rsquo;t look at the ghost. Instead, he gazed at Xiao Huan for a moment and then stepped back.</p>
<p>The ghost fire in the air suddenly began to light up, and the green light reappeared. The faces of the three men changed, but the ghost still stood there, motionless and staring at the ghost fire, and the ghost wand in his hand gradually began to light up.</p>
<p>But at the moment, the most relaxed thing in the whole room seems to be the small ash with fierce shoulders. It seems that it doesn&rsquo;t care about the fight to be faced. The monkey looks around, looks at the ghost fire, turns its head to look at the little ring, makes a face at her, and at the same time grabs it from time to time. (to be continued. )</p>
