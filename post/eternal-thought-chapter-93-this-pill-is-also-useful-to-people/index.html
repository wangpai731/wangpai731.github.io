      <p>In the second area, the ghost tooth retracts the two fingers that he has stretched out to deal with others. He only needs one finger, but Gongsun Yun in front of him can resist his first finger.</p>
<p>At the moment, Gongsun Yun looks pale, quickly retreats, and bitterly admits defeat. Resistance to the first finger is the limit. He can&rsquo;t be hurt too much. Even if he can&rsquo;t fight for the first, he has to fight for the second.</p>
<p>Gongsun Yun walks off the stage and looks back at Gongsun Waner&rsquo;s place. He frowns.</p>
<p>GUI Ya looks calm and leaves the battle platform. Before he leaves, he scans Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s side. When he sees the protection of Bai Xiaochun, he has a strange look in his eyes.</p>
<p>Outside the platform, all the disciples in the south bank bowed their heads They all feel embarrassed, for the north bank, total sympathy.</p>
<p>The north bank disciple is crazy</p>
<p>Gongsun Wan&rsquo;er is crazy. She screams at Bai Xiaochun. She uses all kinds of methods to blow away countless magic techniques, but she still can&rsquo;t break through Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s protection.</p>
<p>Especially in the last one, the Black Bracelet turned into liquid covering the whole body, which could block the foundation building Friar&rsquo;s life protection. After a stick of incense, Gongsun Wan&rsquo;er spat out a mouthful of blood, and the whole person collapsed. She looked at Bai Xiaochun with a look of despair in her eyes.</p>
<p>Just about to fight to summon the Phoenix out, Bai Xiaochun takes a glance at her, and a pill appears in her hand, which is thrown around in the palm of her hand</p>
<p>Gongsun Wan&rsquo;er is indignant and holds his fist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give up!&rdquo; She opened her mouth stiffly, and her eyes showed strong discontent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re willing to let me go, you still know what you mean and don&rsquo;t force me to do it!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s heart is always happy, but on the surface, he puts on an expert&rsquo;s posture and opens his mouth lightly.</p>
<p>With these words, one of the disciples on the south bank burst into tears. Gongsun Wan&rsquo;er was even more angry and shivered all over, gnashing his teeth and leaving.</p>
<p>It was at this time that the battle between Shangguan Tianyou and Xu Song came to an end. The sword of Shangguan Tianyou fell, and a strong light startled the sky. After the light dissipated, all the five beasts in front of Xu Song were listless, and he stepped back a few steps. When he looked at Shangguan Tianyou, his eyes showed admiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The body of sword spirit is extraordinary indeed!&rdquo; He spilled blood from the corner of his mouth, slowly opened his mouth, and turned and walked off the platform.</p>
<p>Shangguan Tianyou is silent. His eyes fall on the ghost teeth. There is a flash of essence. He knows his opponent. Here, only ghost teeth!</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must be like me. It&rsquo;s boring to fight with other people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shangguan Tianyou takes back the flying sword and glances at Bai Xiaochun. Seeing the protection on his body, he shows contempt in his eyes. He steps down to meet him. It is countless cheers from the south bank.</p>
<p>In this cheering, Bai Xiaochun also comes back with pride.</p>
<p>In the first round of the third round, six people fought, the winner guiya, Shangguan Tianyou, Bai Xiaochun, the loser Xu Song, and Gongsun brothers and sisters.</p>
<p>Compared with the victory of Shangguan Tianyou and guiya, the north bank didn&rsquo;t pay much attention to it. At the moment, they had been shameless several times by Bai Xiaochun, and they were mad.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun has succeeded It has led to the rhythm of this battle of pride, and even the impact is so great that it is hard to estimate</p>
<p>The disciples of the outer gate on the north bank looked at Bai Xiaochun with red eyes, clenched their fists, and were so attracted by tens of thousands of people. Bai Xiaochun felt guilty and touched her nose, pretending not to see it.</p>
<p>Gongsun Wan&rsquo;er trembled with anger. His elder brother Gongsun Yun whispered persuasion. Only then did he gnash his teeth and meditate to restore his spiritual power. Others also took time to recover himself.</p>
<p>After the rest time of three sticks of incense, the second scene of the third round officially begins!</p>
<p>In the first area, the opponent of guiya becomes Gongsun Waner. Gongsun Waner is bitter and looks at the expressionless ghost tooth. She doesn&rsquo;t make a move and chooses to admit defeat. She can&rsquo;t be hurt any more. Otherwise, she will be extremely disadvantageous in the next few games.</p>
<p>With Gongsun Waner&rsquo;s admission of defeat, guiya wins directly.</p>
<p>At the same time, the fighting methods in the second area are roaring. The opponent of Shangguan Tianyou is gongsunyun, who can resist gongsunyun, the first finger in guiya&rsquo;s hand. With a wave of his sleeve, countless insects and insects fly out from all over his body, spreading all over the world and running straight to Shangguan Tianyou.</p>
<p>Shangguan Tianyou looks slightly dignified. When his right hand is raised, a flying sword is humming out, and the sword spirit is vertical and horizontal.</p>
<p>This war should have attracted the attention of the public, but now Whether it is the south bank or the north bank, almost everyone&rsquo;s eyes are on the third area.</p>
<p>There, Bai Xiaochun, with a proud face, came to the stage. The man in front of him was Xu Song!</p>
<p>Xu Song looks at Bai Xiaochun with a sneer in his mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good at pills, good at protection, but you met me this time, destined you will be extremely miserable!&rdquo; Xu Song raised his right hand and waved it violently. At once, there were three fierce beasts. One was a giant orangutan with a height of more than ten meters, another was a tiger, and the last one was It&rsquo;s a giant bat with wings on its back.</p>
<p>As soon as these three fierce beasts appeared, they were extremely fierce and powerful. Each of them gave people nine layers of pressure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bai Xiaochun, let&rsquo;s see if your protection can withstand the continuous bombardment of my three war beasts!&rdquo; Xu Song grinned grimly and was about to make a move.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give up.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun sighs. When her right hand is raised, she takes out her hair and love pill. She looks at Xu Song sympathetically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the word again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kill Bai Xiaochun!&rdquo; At the moment of Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s words, Qi Qi, a disciple of the north bank, roared.</p>
<p>Looking at the pills in Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s hands, Xu Song laughs up to the sky, showing contempt and strong pride.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew you would take out this shameless pill, but do you really think Xu has no preparation? My three war beasts are specially reserved for you. They are all female animals!&rdquo; Xu Song is very proud. This is his best assurance. He is confident that this time he must make a sound for the north bank.</p>
<p>When the disciples on the north bank heard this, they were all excited and cheered for Xu Song.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s heart cluttered, and her eyes turned quickly in her eyes. Her expression was as usual. She still had sympathy in her eyes and said a word lightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My pill is useful to animals and people.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun scares the mouth to finish saying, looked at Xu Song one eye, and aimed at Xu Song side of the three females.</p>
<p>As soon as he uttered his words, the disciples on the north bank were suddenly silent, and everyone stayed for a moment. Then, he could not help but imagine the scenes in his mind. The pictures were so beautiful that everyone took a breath.</p>
<p>Xu Song&rsquo;s eyes widened and his mind boomed. If there was thunder, his face turned pale. He thought of beihanlie, Gongsun Waner, and if Bai Xiaochun said it was true, he would be in love once he was touched by pills He swallowed hard, and subconsciously looked at the three war beasts around him, and the whole person trembled. At the same time, the three war beasts seemed to have wisdom, and they even looked at Xu Song beside him, shaking all over.</p>
<p>Without any hesitation, Xu Song immediately took away the three beasts of war. He did not dare to gamble. Even if he thought that Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s 90% was false, he did not dare to take such a thing to gamble.</p>
<p>At the moment when Xu Song put away the war animals and his mind was shaking, Bai Xiaochun stepped forward, his whole body was shining, and the protection was opened. The whole person took a big stride, approached directly, and raised his right hand with a violent wave.</p>
<p>This wave, a strong spread, Xu Song&rsquo;s strength lies in the number of animals he controls. At the moment, he dare not take out the war animals. His strength is greatly weakened, and he can not resist at all. He is directly rolled up by Bai Xiaochun, with blood spurting out, kicking back, bending and anger. He gives out a shrill roar and makes a fist to admit defeat.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun blinked and coughed. After holding fists, he swaggered away. Behind him, there were countless roars and madness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bai Xiaochun, you, you, you&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That damned pill must be exterminated</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God, who will kill this despicable white Xiaochun? I will give ten spirit stones!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take out 15 spirit stones and kill Bai Xiaochun!&rdquo; The north bank is crazy. When countless people open their mouth, the accumulated spirit stones will soon reach tens of thousands. The people on the south bank are stunned, and they all talk to Bai Xiaochun here one after another. They admire Bai Xiaochun to an unprecedented degree.</p>
<p>This kind of overt reward changed Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s face. He quickly walked a few steps and jumped off the battle platform. He felt chilly behind his back. Especially when he saw that the reward stone was more than 20000, his heart trembled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are unreasonable. Every time I go to war, I persuade the other party to admit defeat first.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun was worried and explained another sentence.</p>
<p>With this explanation, people on the north bank became more crazy and directly added the spirit stone to the level of 30000. The Phoenix in the sky, with a look of schadenfreude, kept calling in the air, and looked at Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s hatred from the bottom of his heart.</p>
<p>Even on the terrace above, there are many elders who are interested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a glorious disciple. I&rsquo;m the leader&rsquo;s younger brother. Who dares to reward me? I&rsquo;ll ask my master to expel him from the sect!&rdquo; White small pure eye sees so, scalp is numb, pull a voice to threaten a way.</p>
<p>So The north bank became more crazy. I don&rsquo;t know who was the first to throw out a flying sword and fly across the battle platform. As a result, almost all the disciples on the north bank took out their magic weapons, and the war beasts around them roared, as if to break out.</p>
<p>Frightened, Bai Xiaochun quickly retreated. Fortunately, at this time, the elders on the terrace couldn&rsquo;t see any more. A light fell down and blocked the north bank.</p>
<p>At the same time, the battle between Shangguan Tianyou and gongsunyun came to an end. Shangguan Tianyou sent out three flying swords. Gongsunyun tried his best to solve the problem and ended the battle with a gloomy admission of defeat.</p>
<p>Shangguan Tianyou is a little short of breath. Gongsun Yun&rsquo;s toughness makes him have to be serious. When he stepped down from the battle platform, he saw the madness of the north bank. He frowned and looked at Bai Xiaochun. His eyes showed contempt and disdain, and even some jealousy in his heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Relying on a pill and protection, I came to this step like me, hum!&rdquo; Shangguan Tianyou turns his head, closes his eyes, and opens his knees.</p>
