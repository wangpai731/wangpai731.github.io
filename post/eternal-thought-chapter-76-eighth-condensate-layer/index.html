      <p>Go to &ldquo;small talk → net&rdquo; to provide you with wonderful novels to read. A kind of Go to &ldquo;small talk → net&rdquo; to provide you with wonderful novels to read.</p>
<p>At the same time, the foundation building friars of the three mountains were laughing and watching Bai Xiaochun being chased. They knew that Zhou Changlao was just a bluff. But just then, they saw that Bai Xiaochun was fighting against the lightning. They all changed their looks and tried to stop them, but they realized that nothing was happening there.</p>
<p>One by one, the eyes suddenly show strange.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This son is not vulgar!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be able to come back alive in the pursuit of the Luo Chen family, this white Xiaochun has its own amazing place!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a Miao child, maybe worse than Shangguan Tianyou, but she&rsquo;s not as good as LV Tianlei and Zhou Xinqi!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just as everyone nodded in secret, Zheng Yuandong, the leader of Zhongdao mountain, also saw Lu qimang. He saw the scene with his own eyes. In fact, when Bai Xiaochun called out, he had already swept all the processes that he had seen.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s performance surprised him, and he didn&rsquo;t immediately stop him. He wanted to see how much potential Bai Xiaochun had. He nodded a little at the moment. His eyes showed admiration. His body shook and he appeared in front of Bai Xiaochun, who was running for his life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help me, leader, elder martial brother. Zhou always wants to kill me. I almost lost my life!&rdquo; Seeing Zheng Yuandong at a glance, Bai Xiaochun quickly goes to hide behind Zheng Yuandong and looks at Zheng Yuandong eagerly.</p>
<p>Zheng Yuandong coughed. Looking at Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s pathetic appearance, he looked up with a wry smile. At the moment, elder Zhou also caught up with him and gave Bai Xiaochun a fierce look. He clasped his fist at Zheng Yuandong.</p>
<p>The two looked at each other. They were both old foxes, and immediately understood their thoughts. The Phoenix was a small matter, and letting Bai Xiaochun stay in the clan was a big thing.</p>
<p>Otherwise, Li Qinghou is good at his time. When he goes out, no one in the clan can live in Bai Xiaochun. After all, he has great achievements. He is a glorious disciple and the leader&rsquo;s younger brother.</p>
<p>Even if the headmaster Zheng Yuandong went to teach a lesson and turned his head, he estimated that Bai Xiaochun would cry in front of the portrait.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master, please leave this matter alone and give me Bai Xiaochun.&rdquo; Perimeter old stare at white small pure, the face shows ferocity, return Jie Jie&rsquo;s smile. [love to go to the small</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your bird&hellip;&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s scalp is numb and is about to explain.</p>
<p>Elder Zhou heard these three words, and his face turned blue. Bai Xiaochun quickly stopped his voice and looked at Zheng Yuandong wrongly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elder martial brother, I have shed blood for the clan, and I have made contributions to the clan&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A cough, a twitch on the face of Zheng PI.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elder Zhou, let&rsquo;s forget it. Although Xiaochun is naughty, he has a good nature. In this way, if he has something out of the ordinary next time, I will never stop him. How about handling it together?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elder Zhou showed a reluctant look. He nodded and left. Before leaving, he glared at Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun took a deep breath and stood up with doubts on his face. He was smart. Things were too sudden just now, but now he gradually reacts. There seems to be something wrong with it But I&rsquo;m not sure. When I look at the headmaster, he speaks faintly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those Phoenix birds were raised by the Taoist couple of elder Zhou. In a battle, his Taoist companion fell down to save him. However, elder Zhou died and lost his lover. He hurt his mind and sometimes went mad.</p>
<p>Outsiders only know that he is obsessed with vegetation, but they do not know that if he does not become obsessed, he will not be able to suppress the killing of the heart and madness, and can only use the help of infatuation to ease the injury of the mind.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry about him if you go crazy Zheng Yuandong looks at Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>After hearing this, Bai Xiaochun felt that Zhou Changlao was very pitiful. Then he felt chilly behind his back. He nodded quickly and spoke wrongly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really didn&rsquo;t prescribe medicine. It was his bird The birds he keeps is a liar to me</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything has cause and effect, no matter what, because since it&rsquo;s in you, don&rsquo;t think about the truth.&rdquo; Zheng Yuandong pats Bai Xiaochun on the shoulder and turns to leave quietly.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun sighed and felt that he was in bad luck. After thinking about it, when he saw the elder Zhou, he walked around. Then he carefully returned to Xiangyun mountain and ran back to his house. He could not leave the house.</p>
<p>As for the bird who falsely accused himself, he thought for a while, worried that Zhou Changlao would be stimulated again, so he gritted his teeth and gave up the idea of revenge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good men don&rsquo;t fight with birds!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun comforts himself, sits in the wooden house, finds out the dozen purple Qi Sheng elixir that he refined. Recalling elder Zhou&rsquo;s hand during the day, his eyes show envy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The building foundation friar is very powerful, almost beat me to vomit blood, fortunately I have immortal skin.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun sighed and sighed. He looked at the purple Qi rising elixir, checked the surrounding area, and took out the turtle pattern pot and began to refine spirit.</p>
<p>Soon, he refined all the pills three times. Looking at the fast and dim silver lines on the pills, Bai Xiaochun sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only there were materials for four-color fire.&rdquo; He also secretly inquired about the materials about the four color fire. There was not no such thing in the clan, but there were very few of them. He needed a great contribution. After all, no matter it was some special medicine making or the method of practicing the fire way, the four color fire was extremely extraordinary.</p>
<p>As for shanxiafang City, it is impossible to sell it on weekdays. Only at the annual auction, there are occasionally four color fire materials, but they are rare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are not many spirit tails.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun checked the rest of the spirit tail, and after a while swallowed a purple spirit pill and began to practice.</p>
<p>As time went by, Bai Xiaochun practiced every day. As he swallowed the purple Qi rising elixir, his accomplishments increased rapidly. When all the pills were finished, the clouds were thick outside and covered the moon. In the wooden house, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s whole body roared. The sound did not come out, but reverberated in his body.</p>
<p>His whole body vibrated, and the spiritual power in his body converged from innumerable positions of his body in this instant, forming a river, just like a river dragon. When he swam around his body, he exploded countless meridians.</p>
<p>At the end of a complete cycle, the spiritual power in his body expanded in a wide range, which was much more than before. Bursts of dirt appeared from his sweat pores and turned into bursts of comfort, which made Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s spirit shake. His eyes suddenly opened. There was a touch of essence in his eyes, which was like a bright fire in the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eight condensate layers!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun laughed and got up to wash his body in the yard. He had been in lingxizong for several years. His body looked strong, but he didn&rsquo;t grow too much, which made him a little depressed.</p>
<p>But fortunately, the appearance did not change, or white net, thin and small.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After eight layers of condensate, my control is also much stronger.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s right hand raises a finger to a big stone in the distance. The stone flies up in an instant. According to Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s mind, the stone can be fast and slow, and it can quickly transform from light lifting to heavy lifting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what I&rsquo;m most interested in is that I accidentally launched the war with Chen Heng that day How to control people Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s eyes show a bright light, but it&rsquo;s a pity that after trying, they always miss the point. After all, people and things are completely different. For a long time, Bai Xiaochun pressed this idea in the bottom of her heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has been said in the skill of controlling tripod with Ziqi that if you reach the eighth level, you can condense a more powerful intermediate grade Ziqi Huading Ding.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun stands in the yard, ponders for a moment, pinches the formula with both hands, and points forward.</p>
<p>In an instant, ziziqi suddenly appeared, that is, the time of two breathes. In front of him, a large purple cauldron was condensed.</p>
<p>In terms of time, it is more than twice as fast as before.</p>
<p>Moreover, this tripod is obviously different from that it used to be. It is no longer fuzzy. It looks very clear. Even the concave and convex runes on it are very clear.</p>
<p>A tremendous pressure spread from the big tripod, and the white little pure eyes of Lu qimang felt the extraordinary of the big tripod.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More powerful than before!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun felt some accomplishments in his body. After releasing the purple Qi tripod, most of his spiritual power would be lost. It took a period of practice before he could continue to use it.</p>
<p>But now, he found that the aura in his body was still more than 70%.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can do it three times!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun is surprised. After dispersing the purple tripod, he takes out the Jinwu sword and turns it into a golden light. He flies out of Xiangyun mountain and goes straight to the gate of the mountain.</p>
<p>When we got to the jungle outside, the sky gradually thundered, as if there was a rainstorm brewing. Bai Xiaochun looked at the rapidly changing sky and felt that there was some danger. So she quickly stood in the middle of the air and pinched the formula. The purple tripod appeared again, pointing to the rocks not far away, the purple tripod hummed away and smashed it fiercely.</p>
<p>When the huge noise came out, the ground shook for a moment. When countless birds and animals woke up, there was a deep pit on the ground, and there were countless cracks around the edge, which spread over a full range of ten feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So strong!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun took a deep breath. He weighed himself. At the moment, he used the immortal silver skin to fight against the purple gas tripod. If he fought with Chen Heng, it would not take too much effort to kill him directly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forget it&hellip;&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun hesitated for a moment. He thought that he didn&rsquo;t want to do anything like this. He tried it once before, and his life was almost lost. He felt that his enemy should be placed under the seventh layer of condensate gas, which is the most secure thing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Between the fingers of my white small pure bullet, the strong enemy from the first layer of condensate gas to the seventh layer of condensate gas was blown away in smoke.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s arrogant little sleeve swung, regretting that there was no fence around, so she could only stand on the Jinwu sword, lift his chin, look at the dark clouds in the sky, turn around to control the Jinwu sword, maintain such an action, and fly to zongmen.</p>
<p>Just then, suddenly Countless lightning in the cloud was attracted by the golden black sword in the air, turned into silver snakes, and ran straight to Bai Xiaochun in an instant</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun immediately opened her eyes.</p>
<p>Not long ago, far away, came the thunder and the scream of Bai Xiaochun</p>
