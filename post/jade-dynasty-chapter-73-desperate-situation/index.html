      <p>The red light curtain suddenly trembled. The ghost king and other people in black, including the trapped Kui Niu, almost turned around at the same time.</p>
<p>The red light flashed, and Tian linger was shocked. However, he saw the red light around the dark red iron tap trembling, but it was still under the protection of the red light.</p>
<p>In a moment, all the people around had already responded. The people in black rushed to Tian ling&rsquo;er one after another. Tian ling&rsquo;er&rsquo;s face was white and panted a little. In a moment of anxiety, he suddenly saw a light in front of him. With a wave of his hands, amber and Zhu Ling fell into the ground.</p>
<p>In the middle of the sky, the ghost King&rsquo;s face suddenly changed. He stamped his foot angrily and said, &ldquo;little girl, I don&rsquo;t know how to live or die. It&rsquo;s bad for me! &quot;</p>
<p>His figure flashed again and again, and he rushed down quickly. But at this time, the sharp howling in the distance came one after another. In a flash, countless lights lit up. It was the righteous people and the team of the demon sect that all arrived here. Killing stopped. The most intense thing was that Taoist Cangsong was not easy to deal with baiduzi and Tian was not easy to deal with Duanmu&rsquo;s ancestor. At the moment, Su Ru blocked the injured with one enemy and two enemies Blood sucking old demon and Lin Feng, the young master under the dead spirit abyss that day.</p>
<p>To other people, such as the monks of Tianyin temple and under the gate of burning incense Valley, including the great Reverend master and apprentice, also came here.</p>
<p>When many people came here, they suddenly saw that there was such a huge wall of light on the beach, and there was still a huge strange and strange beast trapped in it. At that time, their hands slowed down. Baiduzi and Duanmu ancestor jumped away at the same time, leaving Taoist Cangsong and Tian hard to do.</p>
<p>Taoist Cangsong and Tian are not in love at the moment. They let them go, especially Tian. Looking from afar, it seems that his daughter is surrounded by people from the demon sect. He can&rsquo;t help changing his face, so he has to go there.</p>
<p>Baiduzi stood with Duanmu ancestor. First of all, he looked at the battle group of Qinglong. He saw that Qinglong had more than one enemy and three enemies. His face changed. Hum, and then look to the sky, at the moment saw the ghost King swooped down, but the ancient tripod is still slowly rotating in the air. Red light is everywhere.</p>
<p>Baiduzi frowned suddenly and said in a deep voice, &ldquo;Fu Longding! &quot;</p>
<p>Duanmu ancestor stood by and was surprised. He looked into the sky and immediately stayed.</p>
<p>Both of them are highly qualified people in the demon sect, and their vision is far beyond that of ordinary disciples. The ancient tripod looks far away. Its shape is ancient and humble. The two rings beside the tripod are engraved with reliefs of dragon heads. In addition, the mysterious array in front of it is very similar to the &ldquo;trapped dragon Que&rdquo; in the legend of the demon sect.</p>
<p>And this mysterious array of trapped dragon que has always been able to use the power of Fu Long Ding. Only with the spirit of Fu Long Ding as the medium, can it stimulate the spirit of heaven and earth to kill. No matter how high you have, you will also be trapped in it. No way out.</p>
<p>In other words, unless it&rsquo;s such a unique treasure, it&rsquo;s hard for the ghost king to trap Kui Niu, an ancient strange beast.</p>
<p>Back in the field, almost all the other hands have stopped, and their attention is attracted here.</p>
<p>The ghost king is swooping down from the air, but Tian doesn&rsquo;t care about his daughter easily. Although he is far away, he still drives his sword to come, but he is near. Zhang Xiaofan is the first one to follow. At the moment, he is the nearest to Tian ling&rsquo;er. However, there are several people from the black clothes cult who have also rushed to him.</p>
<p>The situation is on the verge of happening, but the key is. All on Tian ling&rsquo;er.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan saw that the man in black was ready to arrive. He was in a great hurry. He jumped hard and flew behind Tian linger. When he was in the middle of the air, the fire stick was already in full bloom. Before the man in black, he swept down a wall of light.</p>
<p>The people in black are screaming. In a flash, several magic weapons came and Zhang Xiaofan was shocked, but he finally blocked these people.</p>
<p>At this moment of lightning and flint, Tian ling&rsquo;er cheered, but saw amber and Zhu Ling drilling out of the ground, and Sheng Sheng pushed out an iron cone.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the red light shook violently, and the lights of the whole trapped dragon que array flashed in disorder, and the feet were in disorder. Especially in front of Tian ling&rsquo;er, there was a hole with a height of more than one person.</p>
<p>In the red light curtain, Kui Niu, a strange beast, roared, his voice moved all over the country, and rushed to here with one foot.</p>
<p>Tian ling&rsquo;er was very happy. When she was about to call back the treasure amber Zhu Ling, all of a sudden she heard Zhang Xiaofan cry out behind her: &ldquo;be careful, elder martial sister! &quot;</p>
<p>She was startled and raised her head abruptly to see that the huge strange beast had rushed in front of her with a loud bang, and the huge body had hit the light curtain heavily.</p>
<p>At this time, the array of trapped dragon que is in disorder. Once hit by this huge force, the empty space with a height of more than one person suddenly spreads away. Suddenly, it&rsquo;s several times larger, and it can almost let Kui Niu come out. At the same time, the red light was shaking and waving, which blocked the ghost King&rsquo;s body from going out.</p>
<p>At the moment, Kui Niu&rsquo;s eyes are wide open and fierce. Tian ling&rsquo;er has shaken the strange array. He shouts loudly and the giant swings and bites Tian ling&rsquo;er.</p>
<p>Tian ling&rsquo;er was shocked and lost his color. He saw a bloody mouth coming to him. It smelled fishy. He was stunned for a moment, but he didn&rsquo;t move.</p>
<p>At this time, Kui Niu was about to break through. He was trapped in the Dragon Palace just now, but he still killed more than ten people. All the people in black retreated unexpectedly. Only Zhang Xiaofan was shocked, but he was still biting his teeth and rushing away. The firecracker was shining and hit Kui Niu on the head.</p>
<p>In the distance, Qinglong opened song Daren&rsquo;s ten tiger immortal sword, and inadvertently looked at Zhang Xiaofan. At that moment, he saw that the fire staff rushed to Kui Niu. Suddenly, he was almost lost in his mind, and cried out in a lost voice</p>
<p>In the field, Kui Niu is worthy of being a strange beast from the ancient times. When he felt the magic weapon coming, he put his huge head on the fire stick directly with his head. With a bang, the firecracker flew back. Zhang Xiaofan was shocked. He felt that a strong force was almost overwhelming. Deng Deng stepped back several steps.</p>
<p>Being blocked by Zhang Xiaofan, Tian ling&rsquo;er has already come back to her senses. She looks pale and will step back. Unexpectedly, Kui Niu was put together by these human beings tonight. I don&rsquo;t know that Kui Niu has lived for thousands of years, but I think it has never been met like this. It&rsquo;s the extreme of rage. No matter who is in front of him, he should kill his anger first.</p>
<p>Tian ling&rsquo;er only stepped back, but can summon amber and Zhu Ling back to fly. That terrible bloody mouth once again took a bite at the head.</p>
<p>There was a scream in the distance. Su Ru and Qi Hao, who were pale, rushed out together. The first field was not easy to fly like electricity. However, it was too far away from each other, which made it difficult to rescue.</p>
<p>But Tian ling&rsquo;er is not an idle person after all, and he is not willing to die with his hands tied. In a hurry, he waves his hands continuously. Amber and Zhu Ling are like a red dragon flying in the sky. They are blocking her head. They only hope that they can block the giant beast, and then they can escape. And Zhang Xiaofan, who was standing with her recently, jumped up again.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if the red light of amber and Zhuling is similar to that of trapped Dragon Palace just now. Kui Niu&rsquo;s eyes were more furious. In the roar, he almost bit down like Mount Tai.</p>
<p>Once contacted, the emperor made a decision, and amber Zhu Ling was directly pressed down by Kui Niu&rsquo;s huge mouth.</p>
<p>Tian ling&rsquo;er&rsquo;s face was white and her knees were soft. Sheng Sheng was forced to sit on the ground and the dust was flying. At this time, she saw Zhang Xiaofan at the corner of her eyes and said, &ldquo;Xiaofan, go quickly! &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan didn&rsquo;t know that the strange beast was too powerful and had no life or death to fight against it. Unexpectedly, at the moment when the sky changed and the wind changed, it was before the fierce beast. That a figure so fragile woman, but to his anxious cry.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go</p>
<p>The wind, blowing on my face,</p>
<p>As if deep-seated place, there is something surging and excited!</p>
<p>That familiar figure appearance from childhood, just in front of you, the past years engraved heart time, in that moment turned ceaselessly.</p>
<p>What makes you crazy and what makes you miserable?</p>
<p>Think of the sad skeleton in the blood cave?</p>
<p>Think of the fox jumping into the magma under the fire dragon cave?</p>
<p>He breathed deeply, gasped deeply.</p>
<p>Heaven and earth. It was quiet.</p>
<p>Clenched the fire stick, clenched the teeth, the young figure rushed up.</p>
<p>So I rushed up. Recklessly rushed up, rushed between the giant beast and Tian ling&rsquo;er, opened his hands and roared loudly, like a soldier dying, like a sad hero. It&rsquo;s like eight hundred years of time, and it&rsquo;s back again!</p>
<p>Who is heartbreak for?</p>
<p>Who is crazy for?</p>
<p>In Kui Niu&rsquo;s roaring fury, he is also roaring loudly. The fire stick burns up the bright light that never appeared. It looks like a fire that takes life as firewood, burning fiercely!</p>
<p>Bang long</p>
<p>In the sky, there are thunders, shaking the sky!</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s knees were soft, and the seven orifices were bleeding red, and they slipped and dropped on the fire stick.</p>
<p>The stunned Tian ling&rsquo;er suddenly becomes light. The whole person flies back, but Tian is not easy to arrive at last. He pulls her out and waits for Tian to turn around. Suddenly, Zhang Xiaofan is under Kui Niu&rsquo;s pressure.</p>
<p>Kui Niu roared to the sky, and his huge body rose in the air. His huge single foot stepped on Zhang Xiaofan, which was so powerful that everyone was shocked. Even Tian could not easily lose his color.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan gasped heavily. His whole body seemed to be broken. He raised his head slowly. His eyes were full of the darkness in the sky!</p>
<p>When!</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know. Who dropped the weapon?</p>
<p>Who is it, crying out of despair in the dark?</p>
<p>A golden, solemn light, quietly burst out, accompanied by a blue light.</p>
<p>Holding the fire stick in the hands of the youth, countless tiny blood like red blood threads suddenly shine together, under the shadow, like the blood of burning life flowing!</p>
<p>The light of gold and green, blooming from the fire stick, brightened his face, slowly in front of him, on the blue blood bead at the top of the fire stick, a Buddhist truth appeared.</p>
<p>「」！</p>
<p>Then, as if living together with this truth, there is a faint and shining Tai Chi pattern on the chassis of the character.</p>
<p>All of us are shocked!</p>
<p>Except Kui Niu!</p>
<p>The raging beast, already unstoppable, stepped on the youth who could not escape, the youth facing death, stretched out his hands and resisted upward.</p>
<p>Time seems to stop for a moment.</p>
<p>The sky is bleak, and the black clouds are heavy again.</p>
<p>There is a cold wind, blowing gently.</p>
<p>Leaves fall one after another.</p>
<p>Suddenly a figure appeared in the mid air, swooped down, as fast as lightning, it was the ghost king. He rushed to the ground in a twinkling of an eye, grabbed the red iron cone forced out by Tian ling&rsquo;er, and immediately inserted it into the beach. At the same time, his right hand immediately extended out, making a stroke on his left wrist, and immediately there was blood shooting out of the iron cone.</p>
<p>In an instant, the red light flickers on the dark red mysterious iron cone, and the red light is everywhere. In a blink of an eye, before Kui Niu falls, Zhang Xiaofan is connected with the surrounding light curtain, and the trapped dragon que array is activated again.</p>
<p>In the middle of the sky, the Fu Long Ding shines brightly, illuminating half the sky.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>In the loud noise, Kui Niu collided with the red light curtain, and the ghost king was shocked. He stepped back a few steps, but Kui Niu was also shocked back by the red light curtain. At that time, Kui Niu rushed again in fury, but in the loud noise, he couldn&rsquo;t get out.</p>
<p>The ghost King slowly relaxed his body and turned around. He saw that the young man behind him was still in a state of resistance, but the light of the fire stick gradually faded away, only to see his face, blood flowing, with a trace of desolation.</p>
<p>The ghost King stared at him. Zhang Xiaofan opened his mouth and looked at him. Suddenly, there was a silence in the field.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brahma Prajna! This is Brahma Prajna! &quot;</p>
<p>All of a sudden, in the distance behind, the monks of Tianyin temple came out. All the monks, including FA Shan, were shocked and inexplicable. They pointed to Zhang Xiaofan and said, &ldquo;how can you practice the great Brahma Prajna Dharma of our Tianyin temple? &quot;</p>
<p>Only the Dharma phase stood behind the excited people silently and stared at Zhang Xiaofan in front without saying a word. His eyes seemed to flash with light.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan slowly and slowly turned around, as if every time he moved, he spent all his energy until he faced everyone.</p>
<p>Tian is not easy to stand there, his face is iron and green. The green tendons on his hand holding the red flame fairy sword burst up. All the disciples of Qingyun sect looked at the man, the bruised youth, as if they had seen the monster for the first time.</p>
<p>Behind it, there seems to be a deep sigh from the ghost king.</p>
<p>Tian ling&rsquo;er&rsquo;s face was very pale. She stepped forward a few steps, and suddenly stopped again. In the short distance between her and Zhang Xiaofan, suddenly it was so far away that she could not cross!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Xiaofan,&rdquo; she said in a low voice, as if she no longer believed in herself, &ldquo;are these masters really speaking? &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s lips began to tremble, like the deepest fear. He looked at Tian ling&rsquo;er, Shifu, all his peers in the distance, and everyone&rsquo;s faces were so strange.</p>
<p>He suddenly wanted to shout loudly, but he opened his mouth wide, but he couldn&rsquo;t say a word!</p>
<p>Evening wind, blowing his clothes, gently fluttering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good. It&rsquo;s just a blood bead. It&rsquo;s not wrong! &quot;</p>
<p>Suddenly, as if the nightmare had not yet awakened, there was another cry of surprise. Once again, Qinglong stood by, his face full of consternation.</p>
<p>As soon as this is said, the people present, no matter in the demon sect or in the right way, all change color.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The round bead at the top of the magic weapon in his hand, with blood silk around his body, has the ability to suck and bite Kui Niu just now. It must be the blood bead of the black heart old man 800 years ago! &quot;</p>
<p>Everyone was in a uproar. Everyone looked frightened. Only Zhang Xiaofan could not hear anything. I felt that all the people around me were so noisy. Countless people shouted to him, but he couldn&rsquo;t hear anything!</p>
<p>He slowly turned around, and the ghost King disappeared behind him. In front of him, only Kui Niu, a strange beast trapped in the Dragon que array, turned around in a disorderly way, but at last he gave up his life, stood still, and gave a desperate roar to the sky!</p>
<p>The voice, echoing in the empty night sky, is extremely desolate.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan slowly looked up and looked up at the sky.</p>
<p>That cold night! It&rsquo;s dark and boundless, as if it&rsquo;s breathless.</p>
<p>All of a sudden he smiled, despairing, silent, shaking, falling straight and falling heavily on the ground.</p>
<p>At present, a dark, as if the endless dark night sky, endless pressure to him!</p>
<p>Then he fainted. (to be continued. )</p>
