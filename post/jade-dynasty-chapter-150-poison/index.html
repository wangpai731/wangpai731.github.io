      <p>Qingyun Mountain, Tongtian peak.</p>
<p>The fragrance of tea curls from the white teacup with green mouth and green cover, and the freshly brewed tea wafts with white air and spreads in the room.</p>
<p>This is a secluded room in the back hall of Yuqing hall. The three most powerful and famous people in the right way all gather in this room to enjoy tea business talks.</p>
<p>It turns out that when the three disciples of Zhenren Lanyun and Qingyun have left the room to wait for tea, they have already left behind.</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan first opened his mouth and said with a smile, &ldquo;this tea is also a specialty of Qingyun Mountain. Although it&rsquo;s not rare and rare, it&rsquo;s also fragrant. How about drinking it? &quot;</p>
<p>Yun Yilan put down the teacup and nodded: &ldquo;the fragrance keeps the throat. It seems that it flows from the mouth to the abdomen. It is really a good tea. &quot;</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan said with a smile, &ldquo;elder martial Brother Yun, if you like, you can bring some more back to the burning incense valley when you break the beast demon catastrophe in the future. &quot;</p>
<p>Yun Yilan nodded with a smile and said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s so good. You can&rsquo;t deny it, real man. &quot;</p>
<p>The two laughed at each other, but master Pu Hong chanted the name of Buddha. Immortal daoxuan looked at him and said, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter with master? &quot;</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong sighed and said, &ldquo;in fact, I know that in the face of such a catastrophe, I have to keep calm before I can deal with it calmly. It&rsquo;s just that Buddhism is merciful. Once I think that the common people in the world are in dire straits at the moment, I can&rsquo;t help but feel anxious and lose my temper for a moment. Please forgive me. &quot;</p>
<p>Yun Yi Lan&rsquo;s face changed slightly, and a trace of light passed in daoxuan&rsquo;s eyes, but then his face was solemn.</p>
<p>Looking at master Puhong, immortal daoxuan said slowly, &ldquo;master, you are right. Since we claim to be right, we should take all the people in the world as our own responsibility. I was rude just now. &quot;</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong shook his head and said in a low voice, &ldquo;where do you speak? I didn&rsquo;t mean to blame him just now. &quot;</p>
<p>Cloud Yi Lan now facial expression already returned to normal, smell speech to smile slightly. He said, &ldquo;well, well, you are not more intolerable than you are. Let&rsquo;s stop talking nonsense and talk about the whole thing. &quot;</p>
<p>Both immortal daoxuan and master Puhong laughed. He nodded and said, &ldquo;what elder martial Brother Yun said is true. In fact, I&rsquo;d like you to come here today to discuss this matter. It seems that there are strange changes in this animal demon catastrophe. &quot;</p>
<p>Both Yun Yi Lan and Pu Hong were stunned.</p>
<p>Yun Yilan said, &ldquo;what changes, real people, please tell me? &quot;</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan looked dignified and said, &ldquo;a few days ago, I sent some elite disciples, such as Xiao Yicai and Lin Jingyu, to explore the situation of the beast demon. As a result, they just came back last night and told me something unusual. &quot;</p>
<p>Seeing that daoxuan was serious, master Pu Hong could not help but ask, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;? &quot;</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan stopped for a moment, and then he said, &ldquo;according to Yicai, countless animal demons that had originally been killed in the Middle Earth from the South have always been heading for the north. Killing all the way. But recently, I don&rsquo;t know why, suddenly a large number of monsters stopped going north and headed for the southwest. However, it seems that only about 40% of the original number of monsters continued to advance to our north. &quot;</p>
<p>Cloud Yi Lan pondered for a moment and said, &ldquo;in the southwest direction, isn&rsquo;t that the most rampant place of demon cult? &quot;</p>
<p>Taoist immortal daoxuan nodded: &ldquo;yes, now there are three separate sects within the demon sect. The Wandu sect, the ghost King sect and the Hehuan sect are fighting endlessly, although we don&rsquo;t know where the main hall is. But judging from the clues, it should be that the general halls of the three schools are in the southwest, so that place has always been the place where the evil cult is located. And this time, the beast demon suddenly went to that direction in large numbers. I don&rsquo;t know why? &quot;</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong frowned and said, &ldquo;is it possible that the monster has been in conflict with the demon religion. And suffered a little loss, so a large number of monsters went to support it? &quot;</p>
<p>Daoxuan, with a deep complexion, said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not clear at present, but it&rsquo;s the best if it&rsquo;s like this. However, animal demons and demons are both disasters. If we can fight each other. The world is blessed. &quot;</p>
<p>Yun Yilan suddenly shook his head and said, &ldquo;two leaders, I don&rsquo;t think it is so simple. &quot;</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan looked at him and said, &ldquo;Oh, please give me your advice. &quot;</p>
<p>Yun Yilan said, &ldquo;you and I are all aware that the people in the demon sect are always selfish. It is impossible to say that they are fighting for the common people in the world to fight against the beast demons &quot;</p>
<p>Seeing that immortal daoxuan and master Puhong both nodded and agreed at the same time, Yun Yilan laughed and said, &ldquo;on the contrary, based on what I have always known about the demon religion, they see that the beast demon is so powerful now. Don&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s the enemy of the demon. Even if the monster hurt them unintentionally, they would rather be dumb and willing to retreat, and let&rsquo;s face these poor criminals with a hoe Monstrous monster.</p>
<p>&quot;</p>
<p>Taoist immortal daoxuan nodded: &ldquo;yes, the cloud Valley master is right, but now the beast demons are indeed a large number of people heading for the southwest. Why is this? &quot;</p>
<p>Yun Yilan was silent for a moment, and said in a deep voice, &ldquo;according to the behavior of the monsters in the Middle Earth in the past few days, they have no specific target. They all kill along the road and go north all the time. Therefore, there must be something strange in this sudden large-scale turning. It should be that the monster close to the southwest suffered a great loss. Therefore, the monster called the God of beasts would mobilize a large number of people and horses to the southwest. However, in the southwest, there have always been no other powerful figures except the people in the demon sect. So I thought, I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s the devil sect. What happened? &quot;</p>
<p>Master Puhong frowned and said, &ldquo;what does the valley master mean? &quot;</p>
<p>Yun Yilan said with a smile, &ldquo;this is not what I can know. &quot;</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong could not help but smile and shook his head: &ldquo;after saying this for a long time, benefactor Yun, are you not saying it in vain? &quot;</p>
<p>For a moment, all three of them were laughing, but a moment later, immortal daoxuan pondered, &ldquo;in my opinion, what elder martial Brother Yun said may not be unreasonable. Anyway, now that a large number of animal demons are leaving for the southwest, the pressure in front of us is relaxed a lot. At least, it can buy us some time. Now the world is full of expectations for us, so we should make some actions to let the world see. &quot;</p>
<p>Yun Yilan took a look at daoxuan and said, &ldquo;Oh, is it true that you want us to take advantage of the absence of the main force of the beast demon and go down the mountain to have a good fight? &quot;</p>
<p>The real man daoxuan said, &ldquo;yes, if you remove one more beast demon, the world will suffer less. So we should be responsible for the right way. &quot;</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong recited a Buddhist name in a low voice. A trace of sarcasm flashed in Yun Yilan&rsquo;s eyes, but then he said coldly, &ldquo;what the real man said is very true. So everything is arranged by the real man. I&rsquo;m willing to be the pioneer. &quot;</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan said with a smile, &ldquo;if you have the will of the master of cloud Valley, why worry about the invincibility of the beast demon! However, in the southwest direction, I thought for a long time that there was a mystery in this matter. Although we should not intervene rashly, it seems inappropriate to ignore it. &quot;</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong nodded his head and said, &ldquo;yes, I mean the same thing. After all, the beast demon is a disaster. We should at least know what happened in Southwest China. &quot;</p>
<p>Yun Yilan said, &ldquo;in this case, we&rsquo;d better send some disciples of Taoist high school to follow him quietly and inquire about it.</p>
<p>&quot;</p>
<p>Daoxuan nodded and said, &ldquo;OK, that&rsquo;s it. &quot;</p>
<p>At this time, Yun Yilan seemed to think of something. Suddenly, he was really humane to daoxuan: &ldquo;yes, there is one more thing. And ask for love from real people. &quot;</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan was stunned and said, &ldquo;the Lord of cloud Valley is so polite. What&rsquo;s the matter! But it doesn&rsquo;t matter? &quot;</p>
<p>Yun Yilan said with a smile, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s said that Lu Xueqi, a disciple of the xiaozhufeng sect, has been punished recently for reflecting on the wall of the moon watching platform of xiaozhufeng. After hearing this, I feel really uneasy and &ldquo;He said with a smile,&rdquo; my bad guy has come to ask me for help these days and said that he would not let Miss Lu be punished because of our demands. Besides, now that animal demons are harming the world, Miss Lu is an outstanding disciple of Qingyun. It&rsquo;s better to ask the real person to see for my face that Miss Lu can be exempted from punishment for the time being. &quot;</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan sighed and said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s all because of my lax discipline that the master of cloud Valley laughs at. &quot;</p>
<p>Yun Yilan said with a smile, &ldquo;where do you speak. It&rsquo;s just bad people&rsquo;s wishful thinking. Moreover, we don&rsquo;t have to worry about the affairs between these younger generations. &ldquo;Then he laughed.</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan pondered for a moment and said, &ldquo;since the cloud Valley master pleads for her in person, I can&rsquo;t help but give her this face. Let&rsquo;s see! I&rsquo;ll send Xueqi back today. At the same time, select a few more disciples and go to the southwest to investigate with her, which can be regarded as a crime and meritorious service! &quot;</p>
<p>Yun Yilan&rsquo;s mouth showed a smile and said, &ldquo;ah! What a coincidence! I just wanted to say that Li Xun, a bad apprentice, would go to southwest China for some training! &quot;</p>
<p>Taoist priest looked at him and said, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go together! &quot;</p>
<p>Yun Yilan laughed and arched his hand and said, &ldquo;well, I&rsquo;ll thank the real person for the villain first. &quot;</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan took back his eyes, picked up the tea cup from the table in front of him, drank it slowly, and his eyes changed. He said slowly, &ldquo;the valley master is so polite. &quot;</p>
<p>Southwest poisonous snake valley.</p>
<p>This huge Valley is surrounded by dense ancient forests. During most of the year, in the early morning and dusk, poisonous fog similar to miasma rises in the forest. In fact, those are the poisonous gas of countless poisonous snakes inhabiting the valley.</p>
<p>No one can tell why there are so many poisonous snakes in this valley, so many that they are so ubiquitous on trees and underground. Only the house of Wandu gate in the valley is located. Because of the secret method of Wandu gate, these poisonous insects dare not get close to it.</p>
<p>And these poisonous snakes all over the mountains and fields have become the natural barrier and inexhaustible treasure house of poison.</p>
<p>At this moment, it is the early morning of the day. From the dense forest of poisonous snake Valley, we can see a faint mist rising. It looks like the morning fog at the beginning of the morning. However, if an ignorant person approaches, he will soon be killed by the venom, bleeding from his seven orifices, and finally be buried by the snake kiss.</p>
<p>On weekdays, in addition to these poisonous snakes guarding the valley, there are always disciples of the Wandu sect patrolling to guard against foreign enemies. However, for some reason, none of the disciples on guard have ever come out. It seems that the factional disputes in the ten thousand poison sect have reached a heated stage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pa&rdquo;, with a slight sound, a small stone rolled over. It jumped twice on the old road outside the poisonous snake Valley, which was also dilapidated and overgrown with weeds. It rolled into the grass nearby and disappeared.</p>
<p>Then, with a slight footstep sound, three tall but strange beasts appeared on the road. All of them were wolf heads, but their bodies were the usual tiger and leopard appearance. They looked extremely strange.</p>
<p>The three monsters looked wary, their noses twitching and sniffing in the air, and slowly approached the poisonous snake valley. And the valley is quiet, it seems that they are not alert to the arrival of these three unexpected guests.</p>
<p>Suddenly, one of the monsters, the wolf head, seemed to find something, and then gave a low roar. The other two monsters stopped at once. Look at the strongest and biggest monster standing in the middle.</p>
<p>The wolf head monster&rsquo;s eyes flashed with fierce light, and his nose kept sniffing. However, he did not go to the poisonous snake valley. Instead, he slowly walked to a dense grass beside the ancient road outside the poisonous snake valley. A faint smell of blood came out from the grass.</p>
<p>The monster growled and stepped into the grass. From the outside, the monster&rsquo;s body kept moving. It seems to be looking for something in the grass.</p>
<p>A moment later, the grass was shaking again. The robust monster jumped out of the grass and jumped back into the ancient road. In its mouth, it was biting a strange thing.</p>
<p>It looks like a long whip, or some monster&rsquo;s tail. The fur on it has begun to rot, and its color is dim, and it constantly emits a trace of bloody smell.</p>
<p>Two other monsters roared at the same time. Obviously, he was frightened and angry, and his eyes flashed with fierce light.</p>
<p>The monster who picked up the tail put the thing on the ancient road, and suddenly raised its head and roared. The sound was like a wolf howling, shrill and sharp, straight up into the sky.</p>
<p>A moment later, the monster took up its tail and ran back quickly, regardless of the other two monsters. Left snake valley.</p>
<p>And the two monsters roared a few times, then suddenly made a force, rushed into the poisonous snake Valley, and entered the poisonous snake valley. The ancient road is more curved and narrow, winding forward, with dense brambles on both sides of the mountain forest, among which there is a vague, micro colored mist.</p>
<p>The monster rushed straight forward to see them gnashing their teeth. As long as someone appears in front of them at the moment, they will be torn to pieces.</p>
<p>The color mist floated gently, and gradually gathered in the forest. The two monsters roared and even did not look. They rushed in directly. At first, there was nothing abnormal, but the two monsters, somehow, began to roar and run slower and slower. After a while, their whole bodies began to shake.</p>
<p>It seemed that they knew something was wrong. The two monsters stopped and turned their heads hard to leave the forest. But before they took a few steps, they had already collapsed. In an instant, their seven orifices were bleeding and they were dead.</p>
<p>In the mountains and forests, there was a chilling sound of &ldquo;hissing and hissing&rdquo; at the same time. In less than a moment, countless snake heads appeared from the grass and trees, and all the snakes, big or small, climbed over.</p>
<p>When these poisonous snakes were fighting for food, suddenly, many snakes stopped, raised their heads vigilantly, and then turned to the entrance of poisonous snake valley.</p>
<p>In the distance of that desolate ancient road, it seems that there are faint and low drums roaring. The whole earth slowly starts to vibrate. The strange sound, like the advance of thousands of troops, comes from the endless distance.</p>
<p>In the early morning the valley fell into a dead silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoa! &quot;</p>
<p>After a long breath of malice, fan Xiong, the first disciple of poison God, shook his hand fiercely and threw aside the corpse of a ten thousand poison sect disciple whose skull was cracked by him. The corpse flew through the air and fell to the altar in front of the hall with a bang.</p>
<p>It seems that there are demons sneering in the dark, or they are going to make a memorial ceremony for the sect leader of the evil cult who killed so many people in his life. Inside and outside the coffin where the poison God&rsquo;s coffin is located, there is a river of blood, and the bodies of the disciples of the ten thousand poison sect are everywhere.</p>
<p>The thick smell of human blood was floating in the air.</p>
<p>At the moment, fan Xiong, Cheng Wuya and Duan Rushan, the three disciples of the poison God, have been fighting for several days. In addition to some leaders with profound Taoism, most of the ordinary disciples of the ten thousand poison sect have been killed and injured. These days of fighting have made these three people who fight for power red eyes and almost fall into madness.</p>
<p>The box containing the seal of the door owner is still lying there quietly, watching all this coldly.</p>
<p>As if he was tired of killing, the fighting inside and outside the hall gradually subsided, but the tension of the sword was even worse.</p>
<p>Surrounded by four strange looking old men, Duan Rushan&rsquo;s eyes flashed fiercely. He looked at fan Xiong and Cheng Wuya, who were separated in front of him. He sneered, &ldquo;I said, two senior brothers, are you still willing to stop? Now, who can take it out except for some old guys around you? &quot;</p>
<p>Fan Xiong and Cheng Wuya look at each other, and they see a trace of despair in each other&rsquo;s Scarlet eyes. Since the night of the first seven of the drug God, there was a sudden noise in the spirit hall. The three factions that had been on guard against each other immediately rushed into the spirit hall. They were afraid that if it was too late, the head of the sect would be believed to have been stolen by others.</p>
<p>And in that mess. When countless people rushed into the hall, they naturally thought that the other party had planned to break the agreement to seize the seal of the sect leader. They had already killed each other in a few words.</p>
<p>And so far, the result of the three faction melee. Finally, it became clear that Duan Rushan, who had always been weak in Taoism, gradually defeated fan Xiong and Cheng Wuya by virtue of his strong strength.</p>
<p>At the moment, in addition to the baiduzi, the blood sucking old demon and Duanmu Laozu who are still standing behind them, there are less than ten people. They have no chips in their hands.</p>
<p>Duan Rushan is surrounded by not only the &ldquo;four old men of the poison gate&rdquo;, but also at least hundreds of people, among them, there are many masters. The Wandu gate has always been strong, and there are more than 60 Chengdu in Duan Rushan&rsquo;s hands than before the war, which is really beyond their expectation.</p>
<p>Seeing that the defeat has been decided, fan Xiong and Cheng Wuya are full of unwilling color, but after all, they can&rsquo;t say anything more. They see the appearance of the two senior brothers. Duan Rushan couldn&rsquo;t help laughing. He always had two domineering senior brothers above him, and his master poison God loved Qin Wuyan even more. Only he was ignored all the time. After so many years of tolerance, he could finally be proud of himself. How could he not be overjoyed.</p>
<p>Duan Rushan walked forward with a high air. The four old guards of poison gate were around him. Fan Xiong and Cheng Wuya watched him walk to the front of the offering table and stand in front of the box. One clenched his fist tightly, and another clenched his teeth. Obviously, he was extremely resentful in his heart.</p>
<p>But their anger at the moment, in Duan Rushan&rsquo;s eyes, is undoubtedly the winner&rsquo;s favorite appearance. He even felt that it was when he had such a superior position that he could not waste his whole life.</p>
<p>Duan Rushan laughs, arrogant and proud, reaches out his hand and holds the green box in his hand.</p>
<p>Fan Xiong and Cheng Wu roar in a low voice at the same time. He took a step forward, but the fourth old man of poison gate immediately turned to look at them. Meanwhile, Duan Rushan&rsquo;s men hugged them and surrounded them. They looked at the box in Duan Rushan&rsquo;s hand from a distance, as if they wanted to spurt fire from their eyes.</p>
<p>Duan Rushan was even more pleased with his laughter. He turned the lock and opened the box. Inside the box, he saw a small dark brown seal on the bottom of the silk. On top of the seal was a small snake with a lifelike shape. Although it did not turn over, everyone present, including Duan Rushan, knew that the four characters were engraved under the small seal</p>
<p>The seal of ten thousand poisons.</p>
<p>Duan Rushan looks around arrogantly. His eyes linger on the faces of fan Xiong and Cheng Wuya for a long time. After enjoying the joy of the winner, Duan Rushan smiles. Although the smile is somewhat weird and vicious because of the blood splashed on his face, he takes up the seal of ten thousand poisons and turns it over. He should take a good and careful look at this symbol, which represents the highest power of Wandu sect.</p>
<p>At that moment, there was no sound above the spirit hall except for the angry gasps of fan Xiong and Cheng Wuya. A new generation of master of Wandu sect was about to be born.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, at the moment when everyone held their breath, Duan Rushan even let out a heartrending roar, and his box and the vital seal of ten thousand poisons fell to the ground. They were surprised and looked at him together. After a while, they were all shocked.</p>
<p>I saw Duan Rushan, who had just been invincible, trembled all over his body at the moment, and his face had completely lost its blood color, especially his two hands, which turned into a very strange dark color in a twinkling of an eye.</p>
<p>A moment later, a low chirp and flapping sound came from his hands, and a strange flying insect flew up between his fingers.</p>
<p>All the people present were senior figures in Wandu sect. Although the strange insect was flying very fast, almost all of them had seen it clearly. Baiduzi first cried out: &ldquo;seven centipedes, that&rsquo;s seven centipedes! &quot;</p>
<p>The voice was like a heart shaking roar, which shocked all the people. They all looked at Duan Rushan and saw that his whole body was shaking more and more severely. An old man next to him just wanted to stretch out his hand, but his hand only touched his clothes a little. Suddenly, he shook his body, yelled and flew back. His right hand was black for a moment.</p>
<p>Standing in the distance, the blood sucking demon&rsquo;s pupil shrank and said in an astringent voice, &ldquo;rotten moss &quot;</p>
<p>The poisoned old man exclaimed, but another old man nearby didn&rsquo;t want to think about it. With a roar, he grabbed a broken leg of a chair that fell from his side and chopped it down to his right hand. Under his profound conduct, the chair leg was as invincible as a blade. Hard Sheng cut off the poisoned old man&rsquo;s right arm, and immediately the old man threw the chair leg out. It seems that they are afraid to hold it for a while, and their hands will suffer the same fate.</p>
<p>The legs of the chair were flying in the air, and everyone dodged.</p>
<p>At the moment, Duan Rushan&rsquo;s face is black, and everyone can see clearly. On his two completely black hands, the skin burst with a thump, and the outflow was actually black blood.</p>
<p>For a moment, Duan Rushan, one of the two most poisonous poisons in the world, kept ringing in his hair. His skin and flesh burst, and black blood splashed all over him. He fell to the ground, struggling for a moment, and did not move again.</p>
<p>Fan Xiong was staring at the younger martial brother who was still rampant a moment ago, but now he has died. Suddenly he turned back and yelled, &ldquo;Qin Wuyan, you treacherous beast, get out of here! &quot;</p>
<p>People suddenly realize that &ldquo;rotten moss&rdquo; is ferocious and vicious. It is one of the most poisonous things in the world. Even in the ten thousand poisons gate, only poison God can use it. Fan Xiong, Cheng Wuya and Duan Rushan can&rsquo;t use it because of their practice.</p>
<p>The seven tailed centipede is a rare and extremely poisonous thing. It has always been collected by the poison God. This time, the two major poisons appear at the same time, and they are in the small box with the seal of ten thousand poisons. No doubt, it is Qin Wuyan who cheated everyone and poisoned them secretly.</p>
<p>For a moment. Everyone in the spirit hall is in danger. Everyone looks around him quietly, for fear that Qin Wuyan&rsquo;s figure suddenly appears from his side. Duan Rushan&rsquo;s death was too terrible, and no one was shocked and frightened.</p>
<p>this moment. No one dares to come out of the spirit hall. Only at Duan Rushan&rsquo;s corpse, drops of black blood fall slowly. When it hits the ground, it makes a slight hissing sound and burns the small hole out. In the twinkling of an eye, there are small holes around the body, which shows the strong toxicity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha ha, what&rsquo;s the matter? We haven&rsquo;t seen each other for a few days. It&rsquo;s rare that you think of me like this! A voice from Rong Ping suddenly came in from outside the spirit hall. People were shocked and looked out. Qin Wuyan changed his clothes, took off his linen clothes and put on his usual clothes. With a smile on his face, he slowly came in. And the man with sharp eyes already saw that on his shoulder, there was a little strange insect, which was a seven tailed centipede.</p>
<p>Fan Xiong hated and said, &ldquo;did you poison me? &quot;</p>
<p>Qin Wuyan seemed to treat everyone as if they were nothing. He walked up to Duan Rushan&rsquo;s corpse. In full view of the public, he reached out and picked up the extremely poisonous seal of ten thousand poisons.</p>
<p>Fan Xiong and Cheng Wu Ya&rsquo;s eyes contract. Cheng Wu Ya sneers and says, &ldquo;OK! Younger martial brother, the three of us really look down on you. &quot;</p>
<p>Qin Wuyan said with a smile, &ldquo;the second elder martial brother is joking. In fact, with the strength of the three senior brothers, it is easy to take the life of my younger brother. I dare not resist. However, before his death, Shifu told me a thousand things. Now, the ghost King sect and the Hehuan sect all look forward to it, and the three elder martial brothers are not great. So I must accept the position of sect leader, so as not to destroy the foundation of Wandu sect for hundreds of years. My younger brother was raised by my master since childhood. He was very kind to him. He didn&rsquo;t dare to disobey him. So he had to make a little plan and let the three elder martial brothers suffer. &quot;</p>
<p>Fan Xiong said angrily, &ldquo;bah, do you think you must win now? I tell you, I will kill you first! &ldquo;After that, he turned to Cheng Wuya and said,&rdquo; second, this boy is too vicious. Let&rsquo;s kill him first, and then we will divide the world equally. &quot;</p>
<p>Cheng Wuya immediately said, &ldquo;OK, let&rsquo;s go! &quot;</p>
<p>In the shouting, he and Bai Duzi were about to rush forward. When baiduzi and the blood sucking old demon who were following them were about to follow, Qin Wuyan said faintly, &ldquo;some elders, you can see that my senior brothers are really not in a good mood. You want to come and kill me, not to mention that you can beat me just because I have seven centipedes and rotten moss.</p>
<p>Even if you kill me together and follow these two wastes, do you think it will be better in the future? Can you overcome the ghost King sect and the Huan sect? Can you escape under the siege of those in the right path? &quot;</p>
<p>Baiduzi, the blood sucking old demon and Duanmu Laozu all stopped in astonishment. The two poisons Qin Wuyan used on Duan Rushan just now can&rsquo;t be applied by those who have been well-known in the poison classics of Wandu sect. Although they have been in Wandu gate for many years, they still can&rsquo;t reach that point. They are really afraid of Qin Wuyan, a young man who looks young. Listen to Qin Wuyan said a few words this time, the heart hesitates for a moment, all no longer move forward.</p>
<p>Many other people who followed Duan Rushan would not listen to the orders of fan Xiong and Cheng Wuya. At the moment, most of them looked at each other and were at a loss. Qin Wuyan looked at the crowd and said with a smile, &ldquo;ladies and gentlemen, as long as I take the position of headmaster, I will not forget the past. I will wait for you to see what you are like in the sect. &quot;</p>
<p>In the angry and anxious eyes of fan Xiong and Cheng Wuya, they look at each other for a long time, and then baiduzi first retreats. A moment later, the blood sucking old demon, Duanmu Laozu and the four elders of the poison gate also slowly walk aside, leaving Qin Wuyan, fan Xiong and Cheng Wuya three brothers standing in the field.</p>
<p>Fan Xiong&rsquo;s face showed a look of despair. Knowing that the situation was over, Cheng Wuya was even more pale. Qin Wuyan still has a faint smile on his face, but his heart is filled with resentment. What he hates at the moment is not the two elder martial brothers in front of him, but Taoist Cangsong. He had already made a plan to let the three elder martial brothers kill each other, but it was not such a large-scale fight. As long as the three elder martial brothers were removed, he would naturally be able to control the power of Wandu sect.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, Taoist Cangsong suddenly got in the way that night and started a big scuffle among the three factions. Shengsheng destroyed the original profound strength of Wandu sect in the civil war. Qin Wuyan is angry and sad at the moment. He really wants to split Cang song Dao&rsquo;s life into two parts. But want to return to think, Cangsong Taoist at the moment is not a shadow, Qin Wuyan can only mute endure.</p>
<p>But anyway, Qin Wuyan is sure to win. With a smile of victory, he looks at the two elder martial brothers and says leisurely, &ldquo;two senior brothers, don&rsquo;t you apologize in front of the master&rsquo;s spirit (to be continued. )</p>
