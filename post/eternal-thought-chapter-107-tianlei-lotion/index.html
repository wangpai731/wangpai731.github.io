      <p>When he returned to Xiangyun mountain, Bai Xiaochun was sad. He didn&rsquo;t dare to continue to test many strange pills left in his storage bag. Especially when he was walking on the road of Xiangyun mountain, all Xiangyun mountain disciples, when they saw themselves, were either eccentric or fierce, and they were angry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so hard to stick to the great ideal It&rsquo;s not my fault. Uncle Li asked me to study it myself&hellip; &quot; Bai Xiaochun sighed, trotted all the way back to the cave, sat there, looking at the distant sky in a daze.</p>
<p>When he was refining medicine more than half a year ago, he encountered some difficult problems. He also went to ask Li Qinghou. When Li Qinghou heard about Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s questions, he was also surprised. In his opinion, this kind of study on medicine is absolutely beyond the ordinary pharmacist&rsquo;s ability to do.</p>
<p>Thinking of the achievements of Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s stone tablet, Li Qinghou is full of expectations for Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s medicine, and everyone has different understanding of it. Bai Xiaochun has such persistence. Li Qinghou is very pleased that he did not directly tell Bai Xiaochun the answer, but encouraged him to try more. Only after he tried, could he obtain his own medicine. If only by following the rules If you follow the rules, you will never become a master of medicine. After all, the origin of danfang has been tried by generations!</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I have ideals and dreams. Uncle Li is right. Only when you get what you get, you really belong to yourself. No matter how hard it is, you have to overcome it!&rdquo; After a while, Bai Xiaochun gritted his teeth. He didn&rsquo;t want to test strange pills, but he became more and more persistent about the medicine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must be a great pharmacist!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun took a deep breath and resolutely went to the refining pharmacy. She was crazy again, immersed in the alchemy and completely forgot herself.</p>
<p>As time went by, several months passed in a twinkling of an eye. Bai Xiaochun slowly mastered the third-order elixir more skillfully. As one problem after another was overcome, the third-order elixir in his hands seemed to have no too much difficulty.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just But there is a bigger problem.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun is helpless to find that although he is very skilled in refining third-order pills, his success rate is difficult to improve. Generally speaking, he can achieve five times in ten alchemy. One of the remaining five times is to refine strange pills that he can&rsquo;t recognize, and four times he refines poison pills with impurities accounting for nearly 10%.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun was going crazy. He also tried to refine spirit. He found that the effect of poison pill was very poor even if it was alchemy. Only when it came to the inferior level, could he use Alchemy to improve the quality.</p>
<p>But he has a kind of paranoia about refining medicine, even he doesn&rsquo;t realize it. There seems to be a compulsive symptom in his personality. If he is not satisfied, he will be restless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impurities, how to get rid of impurities!&rdquo; Bai xiaochunhong stares at the large amount of poison pills in front of him. He thinks hard and asks Li Qinghou. But when he thinks that Li Qinghou once encouraged him to study, he grits his teeth again and goes crazy again.</p>
<p>As time goes by, many people feel that Bai Xiaochun has finally calmed down. There is no roaring noise, and there are no small animals making trouble all over the mountain. In such a peaceful day, many people still don&rsquo;t adapt to it.</p>
<p>But it doesn&rsquo;t last long One month later, late at night, Bai Xiaochun was dishevelled and seemed to be crazy by the stove. He kept pinching the formula to control the fire, and constantly threw herbs into the furnace. His eyes were bloodshot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it will soon be. This time, I have solved all the problems, and I am more creative. I have joined Tripterygium wilfordii, withered wood spring, yin-yang grass, and invented a special way to wash impurities. This is my original creation of Bai Xiaochun Tianlei lotion When he was excited, the furnace in front of him suddenly vibrated, and the fragrance of medicine appeared in an instant. But at the moment when the fragrance of medicine was spreading, suddenly, the sky on the top of Xiangyun mountain was originally night, but the moon was high and there was no cloud.</p>
<p>However, in an instant, thick clouds suddenly appeared. A flash of lightning fell down and went straight to Xiangyun mountain. With a bang, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s cave array vibrated. Many of them got into the cave and landed on the furnace.</p>
<p>The whole cave is full of lightning. Bai Xiaochun quickly avoids it in a wild laugh. When the lightning disappears, he runs to the furnace and looks at it immediately.</p>
<p>There was only a piece of black residue and black smoke in the furnace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are too many thunder inducing flowers!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun was dishevelled, like a madman studying academic studies. He grabbed his hair hard, took out herbs again, and began to mix them.</p>
<p>At the same time, many disciples of Xiangyun mountain saw the lightning and opened their eyes one by one. They realized that the place where the lightning struck was Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s cave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bai Xiaochun Can&rsquo;t even God look down on it? &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be so. The sky has eyes. Lightning will fall to kill him&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>When all kinds of thoughts appeared in the minds of the people, and even many people even had some Schadenfreude, several elders of Xiangyun mountain also noticed the lightning and were surprised one by one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even if it is Li Zhangzuo&rsquo;s refining medicine, it will not cause thunder. According to legend, only the elixir above level 7 will have thunder robbery. What is Bai Xiaochun doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Three days later, at noon, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s laughter reverberated in his cave. He stared at the stove and quickly pinched the formula with his hands. When the earth fire broke out, he roared and clapped his hands toward the furnace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tianlei lotion method!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The furnace vibrated, and in an instant, countless clouds gathered at the top of Xiangyun mountain. A flash of lightning roared and went straight to Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s cave.</p>
<p>This time, countless disciples saw the lightning, and everyone was shocked. When the thunder reverberated in his ear, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s cave trembled.</p>
<p>In the cave, Bai Xiaochun excitedly came to the stove. When he saw it, there was still no pill in the furnace, only the dregs of the medicine. A black smoke rose. He just took a little puff, and he was dizzy. He stepped back a few steps without noticing that there was white foam in his mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More Tripterygium&hellip;&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun murmured and fell down with a thump. She didn&rsquo;t wake up until three hours later. She quickly inhaled her face and swallowed some pills. After a while, she suddenly raised her head and continued to refine medicine.</p>
<p>In the days after that, the thunder became more and more intense. The disciples of Xiangyun mountain often saw a flash of lightning falling down and bombarding Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s cave. Slowly, everyone was stunned. Even the elders paid attention to it many times, and they were all shocked.</p>
<p>They suspect that If this goes on, Bai Xiaochun will be chopped to death sooner or later.</p>
<p>However, Bai Xiaochun, who is afraid of death, in this crazy state of refining medicine, actually forgets death. He immerses himself in the medicine channel, constantly changes the prescription, adjusts the collocation, and tries to make Tianlei lotion effective.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tianlei lotion method!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn it, Tianlei lotion</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The defense array of Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s cave has failed. His voice is sharp and often spreads from the cave. Many people hear it and spread it one after another. Almost everyone knows that the reason for the thunder is that Bai Xiaochun invented a method to wash away impurities in the medicine channel.</p>
<p>Even many elders are interested in Bai Xiaochun. This time, although the sky thunder is rolling, there is rarely anyone to stop it.</p>
<p>Even Li Qinghou is pleased with Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s creativity and occasionally pays attention to it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just After a hundred times of collocation, Bai Xiaochun still couldn&rsquo;t find the ideal proportion. So he began to add other herbs. I don&rsquo;t know what kind of herbs are. One day in the evening, when Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s voice roared, thunder filled the sky. It was not the same as before, but dozens of lightning swam away and all fell down.</p>
<p>Strangely, there was only one flash of lightning falling towards Bai Xiaochun, and all the others scattered in other areas of Xiangyun mountain.</p>
<p>Boom! Boom!</p>
<p>A large number of lightning bombardment, many people screamed. For a moment, Xiangyun mountain vibrated again, and Zhou Xinqi&rsquo;s cave was also bombed. Fortunately, the array blocked Zhou Xinqi&rsquo;s cave. Zhou Xinqi fiercely looked at Xiaochun&rsquo;s cave and tolerated the evil spirit.</p>
<p>Li Qinghou and the elders of Xiangyun mountain also went to appease the disciples of Xiangyun mountain. After all, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s persistence in medicine today made them very appreciative.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just Bai Xiaochun was crazy. An hour later, a dark cloud shrouded him. This time, there were nearly a hundred thunder storms, all of which fell down and went straight to Xiangyun mountain.</p>
<p>When the loud noise was loud, many of the disciples looked at the sky in horror and rushed back to their homes. They did not dare to go out. Li Qinghou and the elders were also in a daze.</p>
<p>Seeing nearly a hundred lightning falls, many areas on Xiangyun mountain vibrate. Maybe it is because Zhou Xinqi&rsquo;s cave is too close to Bai Xiaochun, there are six or seven splits on her cave, which makes Zhou Xinqi&rsquo;s cave vibrate strongly and the array is distorted.</p>
<p>There is no end, that is, the half column incense time, countless people issued a strong uproar, even more frightened exclamation, the sky, at this moment, the clouds are bigger, thick clouds, there are hundreds of lightning roaring.</p>
<p>Going straight to Xiangyun mountain, one after another of the caves trembled, and many areas exploded directly. Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s own cave almost collapsed at this moment, barely supporting it.</p>
<p>But Zhou Xinqi&rsquo;s cave has attracted more than 50 flashes of lightning. The successive bombardment, like a natural disaster, has directly opened Zhou Xinqi&rsquo;s cave and collapsed.</p>
<p>Zhou Xinqi looks pale and quickly escapes. She looks stupidly at her cave which has been razed to the ground, and sends out a shrill voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bai Xiaochun</p>
<p>There are also some inner disciples&rsquo; caves, which are the same. They are directly blasted open by lightning. After escaping one by one, they roar and startle the sky. They are about to go to find Bai Xiaochun to settle accounts All of a sudden, the dark clouds in the sky rolled again, and their thick degree formed a depression that covered the earth. Zhou Xinqi&rsquo;s heart trembled and she was shocked. The other disciples who wanted to find Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s trouble took a breath and their hearts were shaking.</p>
<p>Even the palm seats of ziding mountain and Qingfeng mountain also noticed here. When they saw the clouds, they immediately opened their eyes. There was also the leader Zheng Yuandong. When they looked from a distance, their scalp was numb.</p>
<p>There are thousands of lightning in the clouds!!</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is This is to destroy Xiangyun mountain</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bai Xiaochun</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God, what is he doing? How did he do it So much lightning</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enemy attack! Enemy attack Inside and outside Xiangyun mountain, countless people screamed in horror.</p>
<p>In particular, on Xiangyun mountain, countless disciples trembled, both outside and inside. At this moment, everyone had a strong crisis of life and death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tianlei lotion method!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun had already forgotten herself and didn&rsquo;t notice everything around her. At the moment, her eyes were red and she looked at the furnace in front of her. Suddenly, she roared and raised her hands toward the furnace.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
