<p>A month later, when the cold wind gradually rose and the autumn leaves fluttered down the Tongtian River, Bai Xiaochun suddenly found that he had been here for a year. [love to go to the small</p>
<p>In this year, too many things happened to him, from a mortal to a monk, with the cultivation of three layers of condensation gas, which also resolved a series of disputes caused by becoming a member of the fire kitchen.</p>
<p>Xu Baocai never appeared in front of the fire kitchen room again. When Bai Xiaochun went down the mountain to buy the frequently used articles of the fire kitchen, Zeng saw Xu Baocai from a distance, and Xu Baocai quickly avoided it, as if he were completely afraid of him here.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, during the month, Bai Xiaochun often frowned and sighed at the bottom of her heart. She didn&rsquo;t say anything to Zhang daphou and others. She could only help herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A year&rsquo;s longevity&hellip;&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun looks at the big tree not far away. The leaves turn yellow and fall with the wind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just like this big tree. The fallen leaves are my birthday&hellip;&rdquo; When Bai Xiaochun thought of it, she was quite sad.</p>
<p>This month, he tried his best to nourish his hair. However, the white hair in the tip of his forehead still did not turn black. He also asked Zhang dachou and others. He already understood that in this realm of cultivation, there are not no methods to supplement Shou yuan, but there are some restrictions or rare ones.</p>
<p>Gradually, he did not want to eat tea, even his face was haggard, but when he had to choose to give up and had to accept that he had reduced his life by one year, one afternoon, he went out to buy things from the fire stove, standing under the third peak, looking at a huge stone tablet there, breathing slowly and quickly.</p>
<p>This stone tablet is on the South Bank of lingxizong. There is a piece under each peak. There are countless lines of writing on it. Sometimes it slides like water and is replaced by new lines.</p>
<p>This is the place where the Lingxi sect accepts the mission of the sect. If you are a disciple of the Lingxi sect, you need to complete the mission of the sect in exchange for the spirit stone and contribution points needed for practice.</p>
<p>In particular, contribution points, whether to listen to the Scriptures, to the Shufa Pavilion, or to that special place of practice, can be used in almost everything in the sect, even more precious than the spirit stone to some extent.</p>
<p>At the moment, beside the stone tablet of the task under the third peak, there are many disciples of the outer gate staring at it. Sometimes, after choosing the task, they immediately whispered respectfully with the middle-aged monk who sat down on their knees under the stone tablet.</p>
<p>There are also some miscellaneous servants, and they can be clearly distinguished from the outer disciples in the blue cloud water robe.</p>
<p>The tasks of Lingxi sect only need to be completed by the inner disciples, which are not revealed here. As for other tasks, you can choose from the outer disciples or the laborers.</p>
<p>Some workers who strive to make progress will regard this place as their first step in leaping over the dragon&rsquo;s gate.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun has been standing here for a long time. Her face is cloudy and uncertain. She stares at the stone tablet, and a line of flashing handwriting shows hesitation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Longevity pill I didn&rsquo;t expect that there was such a pill in zongmen. It seems that it can increase longevity by listening to the name&hellip; &quot; For a long time, Bai Xiaochun murmured and thought about Shaoqing, and came to the middle-aged monk under the stone tablet.</p>
<p>He was surrounded by many other disciples. When they realized that Bai Xiaochun was coming, they all chose to ignore it. Because of their different identities, they were totally indifferent to the laborers.</p>
<p>Until the middle-aged monk&rsquo;s side less people, white Xiaochun showed a clever appearance, clasped his fist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good afternoon, elder martial brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The middle-aged monk looked up at Bai Xiaochun, nodded slightly and did not speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elder martial brother, there is a task to find some herbs to exchange for a longevity pill. Do you know if this pill can increase longevity?&rdquo; Concerning his own Shou yuan, Bai Xiaochun asked in a hurry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Longevity pill Well, there is such a task. This pill can prolong life and increase life by one year. However, there are many restrictions. It can only be used below five layers of condensate gas. It is only effective for the first time, and it is useless to eat it again. It is said that it is precious, but it is only one year old, but it is not very useful. &ldquo;The middle-aged monk saw that Bai Xiaochun was clever, so he couldn&rsquo;t help saying more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Generally speaking, it is only used as a disciple of the clan to give the elderly mortals a life, but the price is not cheap. Do you want to take this task?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun looked up at the stone tablet and nodded.</p>
<p>The middle-aged monk raised his right hand to the stone tablet, and immediately the task on it became gray. At the same time, he put a jade slip on his right hand and threw it to Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Qingling leaf, earthworm fruit and stone worm skin, these three kinds of medicinal materials, you can come here in exchange for a longevity pill.&rdquo; The middle-aged monk spoke faintly, ignoring Bai Xiaochun. Instead, he introduced the task to the outside disciples who came to the side.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun left with the jade slips. Her mind was full of the four words to prolong her life. Her eyes slowly showed firmness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must change to this pill to make up for the year I lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With such determination, Bai Xiaochun went straight to sihaifang to search for some information that could be provided to the servants, and found the introduction of qinglingye in it. It is a kind of herb named houling bird that grows only when it inhabits. Because this kind of houling bird likes to live in groups, and usually one of them is comparable to the second layer of condensation gas. It is not easy to obtain it, so the price is always high.</p>
<p>As for the earthworm fruit and the stone insect skin, sihaifang has never recorded it. Bai Xiaochun touches her pocket and leaves with a bitter smile. After returning to the fire stove, she asks Zhang daphou and others. No one has ever heard of dilongguo, but the stone insect skin heisanpang knows that it is really a kind of spiritual insect named Shi Chong, which has shed its skin.</p>
<p>It is said that this skin is extremely hard and heavy. It is rare here on the south bank. The north bank is only produced because the main skill is controlling animals. However, although both sides are Lingxi sect, the main peak mountain bridge can be separated. Unless you become an inner disciple, you are not qualified to step into the bridge mountain to travel between the two sides.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are these herbs for? These things can&rsquo;t be eaten, and the prices in Nan&rsquo;an square city at the foot of the mountain are exorbitant. &quot; Zhang daphou patted his stomach and said in surprise.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s eyes brightened as soon as he heard the word &ldquo;Fang Shi&rdquo;. After a brief explanation, he went straight to the foot of the mountain. Although the number of times when he was in the huozao room was limited, he knew that there was a Fangshi outside Zong&rsquo;s door.</p>
<p>Most of them are set up in the Xiuzhen family where the disciples of the sect belong. There are even some unique features that are held by the disciples of the sect. They serve the disciples of the sect. Over time, they gradually have a certain scale.</p>
<p>On weekdays, things needed by the fire kitchen are also purchased here.</p>
<p>After walking around the square city, especially some herbal medicine workshops, when she returned to the fire kitchen, Bai Xiaochun frowned and sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too dark, especially the fruit of earthworm, which is a kind of vegetation growing under the ground. It&rsquo;s so expensive!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun has no choice but to find that with his own skills, he can&rsquo;t exchange for a longevity pill.</p>
<p>He has no idea about money. Compared with Shouyuan, he doesn&rsquo;t care how much money he has. But he is short of money at the moment. When he is with several fat elder martial brothers, he also knows that those people have goods in their stomachs, but their pockets are as shriveled as before. They are not much richer than themselves.</p>
<p>As for the spiritual food in the fire kitchen, they steal food, but no one catches the painful feet. But if they want to sell it, the supervision room people stare at the degree of disgusting.</p>
<p>After thinking about it, there is no way to make money, except to sell the alchemy.</p>
<p>However, he always felt that it was not right. He thought hard for several days. On this day, when he was sitting in the house, he suddenly heard a bell ringing in the door.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun opened his eyes without any surprise. After entering the sect, he could hear the bell every month and knew it from Zhang daphou. This was the day when the trial road of each peak was open to the laborers and the number of disciples promoted to other schools was given.</p>
<p>If you want to become an outside disciple from Yu yuelongmen, you must first have the cultivation of three layers of condensing gas. Secondly, you should choose the trail of a mountain peak. Although the road of trial is a step that extends to the top of the mountain, it adds magic power and makes it difficult for people to move forward. If you can go up there, you will have the qualification to become a disciple of the outer gate.</p>
<p>However, the number of external disciples is limited. Each time, each peak only selects the top three who have completed the test as soon as possible, and the best is selected from the best. However, there are many miscellaneous laborers in Lingxi sect, and there are tens of thousands of them just in the south bank. Therefore, the competition is fierce every time.</p>
<p>As for the people in the fire kitchen, naturally, they would rather starve to death in the fire than fight in the outer door. On this day of every month, they all look at the bustle with disdain.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun closed his eyes, but suddenly his eyes opened again. There was a strange color in his eyes. After a flash, it turned into a surprise. An idea gradually sprouted in his mind. He stood up and walked in the room for several times. After carefully considering the idea, his face was filled with joy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can be done!&rdquo; He immediately pushed open the door and called Zhang daphou and others who were talking about which worker was unlucky to become a disciple of the outside school.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elder martial brothers, I have an idea to make a fortune. Please help me, and let&rsquo;s get rich together!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun licked his lips and looked at Zhang daphou and others with light in his eyes.</p>
<p>Zhang daphou and others are familiar with this picture. At first, Bai Xiaochun suggested that the bottom of the bowl should be thickened to benefit the fire kitchen room. This was the appearance, and all of them immediately came to be interested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jiupang, what&rsquo;s your idea? To tell you the truth, we are all poor. We all blame the damned supervisor&rsquo;s room. Otherwise, we will sell some things from the fire stove room, and we will send them out! &quot; Zhang Da Pang patted Bai Xiaochun on the shoulder, showing the expectation in his eyes.</p>
<hr>
<p>You are so fierce It&rsquo;s the second recommended ticket!! Brothers and sisters, can you be more violent~~~</p>
