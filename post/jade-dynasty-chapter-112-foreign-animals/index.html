      <p>XuanHuo altar.</p>
<p>Although it&rsquo;s a wooden door, it still feels heavy. Under the fierce force, the heavy and thick door on the XuanHuo altar makes a dull &ldquo;squeak&rdquo; and slowly pushes it open.</p>
<p>In the door, a light red light came out, and the air around seemed to rise a little bit, extremely hot and dry.</p>
<p>The ghost Li frowned and saw sweat on his forehead. He suddenly remembered what he had heard just now. The old man named Shangguan had been guarding this hot place for nearly a hundred years. I don&rsquo;t know how he lived.</p>
<p>In the XuanHuo altar, it doesn&rsquo;t look bright. In addition to the red light from nowhere, it seems more dark, which doesn&rsquo;t match the intense heat around. Ghost Li stood at the door, pondered for a moment, and finally walked in.</p>
<p>With another squeak, the wooden door closed gently.</p>
<p>He inhaled deeply, calmed down, and began to look around. As predicted when I saw the altar outside, it was indeed a huge hall with a space of up to five Zhangs. The whole hall was round, and the walls were made of red rock, without any sculpture and decoration. It was simple and unsophisticated. However, under the background of such a huge space, there was an indescribable grandeur People think that only this kind of flatness is the real highest level of architecture.</p>
<p>Soon, GUI Li found that the red light in the whole hall came from the center of the hall. The closer to the center of the main hall, the brighter it will be. Looking from afar, under the red light, it seems that a hot flame is burning in the main hall.</p>
<p>Ghost Li stared at the &ldquo;flame&rdquo;, the red light gently shining, reflected in his eyes, also in his shoulder in the small ash.</p>
<p>In the eyes of a man and a monkey, at the same time, it seems to be dyed red by something. There is a faint red flame burning.</p>
<p>Little grey&rsquo;s tail swung slightly, and seemed to be a little uneasy, with a low cry.</p>
<p>Take a step to the &ldquo;fire&rdquo; in the center of the hall. Go slowly towards the red light.</p>
<p>As we get closer and closer to the fire, the air around us gets hotter and hotter. At this moment, it&rsquo;s almost like being near the underground lava. In the fierce mind.</p>
<p>Somehow, I suddenly think of a long forgotten past - under the Fire Dragon Cave, the lake of magma, which is hotter than now, a pair of fox demons throwing themselves into the lake</p>
<p>The idea flashed by, less than a foot from the center of the hall. He suddenly stopped. Little grey turned to look at the master.</p>
<p>Only to see the ghost shriveled the eyebrow, the vision has already collected from that regiment flame, looked to the ground.</p>
<p>On the flat floor made of red stones, there are patterns.</p>
<p>Just at the foot of GUI Li, there are marks on the stone with thick and thin fingers. They extend to both sides, but they are not smooth. One foot in front of Guili&rsquo;s body, it is the same kind of finger thick and thin Nick, which is on the hard red stone. They make up a one foot pattern.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a god!</p>
<p>A spirit that has never been seen or heard before.</p>
<p>The vigorous marks are slowly extending on the ground, and traces of being honed by the years can be seen everywhere at the corners, showing the long history of these patterns, revealing a trace of desolation.</p>
<p>God only has no hair on his head, but his horns are slightly curved like sheep&rsquo;s horns. His face and eyes are similar to those of human beings. But under those dark and empty eyes, there are sharp fangs in his mouth. The sculptor even carved a few tiny holes beside the fangs, which were like the blood dripping, adding a bit of ferocity and ferocity.</p>
<p>And the body of this God. It is quite different from the people&rsquo;s Congress that there are four arms on the strong trunk like a tiger and a leopard, one holding a knife and the other holding a shield; the other two hands, one holding a painful and twisted human body tightly. The man seemed to be shouting at the sky, while the other hand gently held up an object, which was the heart of the human being.</p>
<p>The original humble and desolate Mark came here, suddenly became angry and unrestrained, that strength, that deep hatred in my heart. It&rsquo;s like an explosion. The ghost Li unexpectedly so real and the incredible feeling that crazy, soars in this Nick.</p>
<p>The gentle marks were fierce in an instant. They flew down from the trunk. They were integrated into the lower body of the evil god and turned into a burning flame. The red light is shining, and there seems to be a grim smile on the corner of the God&rsquo;s mouth, as if he is going to revive!</p>
<p>In his mind, the sculptor and the man who built the altar became one.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t imagine that there are such a great craftsman and such a genius!</p>
<p>A picture, it seems to seize the world of nature!</p>
<p>The score was still extending on the ground, and he could not help but walk to the side, and gradually found the second and third gods. Finally, after circling the red flame in the center, he found eight God images on the ground. All of them are the same, but it&rsquo;s almost certain that all the inscriptions on the ground are ferocious.</p>
<p>In these images, people are completely the sacrifice of these gods, just like food. In the whole hall, there is a mass of killing at the moment. It seems that with the discovery of these images, there are some murderers growling low in the dark.</p>
<p>But in the periphery of these images, there is also a notch to wrap them all, but it is not a complete circle, sometimes bending inward, sometimes turning outwards, which is hard to see for a moment.</p>
<p>At this moment, he went back to the front of the first design of the evil god. After a deep look at the evil god, he raised his head and saw the fire again.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, there was a &ldquo;buzz&rdquo; in his mind, as if something was turning up, a yearning, a blood sucking yearning, so familiar. Almost at the same time, all of a sudden, the images of the evil spirits around him seemed to come alive, and they were shaking in front of his eyes.</p>
<p>Hidden in the hand of the soul, through the sleeve of the robe, gradually began to light up.</p>
<p>Suddenly, he shook his head heavily, calmed himself, and walked towards the central flame.</p>
<p>However, he forgot to look at the little grey monkey lying on his shoulder.</p>
<p>In that pair of monkey eyes, the golden awn reappeared, but behind the golden, there was more red light, with the crazy blood eating color as in the ghost eyes. Gradually bright and dazzling, full of its eyes.</p>
<p>The distance of one Zhang is not very far. GUI Li quickly gets close to the red light source in the center of the hall.</p>
<p>At the moment, he has found that the eight gods he saw just now are carved in stone. All around this light source, and the head of the statue is facing here. At this time, the surrounding temperature is already extremely hot. If ordinary people are here, they are afraid that even breathing can not continue.</p>
<p>The ghost Li strong from presses down the heart wave by wave to rush upward the blood phagocytosis impulse, passes through the red light. Look at the light source.</p>
<p>A stone well like thing appears in the center of the hall.</p>
<p>Three feet high, but two feet in diameter. Like the stones on the ground, they are all made of red rock.</p>
<p>But on the flat well surface, there is a crystal clear white transparent stone like crystal. It seems to be a circle, but on closer inspection, it is found that there are countless sections with different sizes. Bright and incomparable light flow covers it.</p>
<p>And the red light from the well, after this crystal like stone, is refracted layer by layer. It seems that there is blood flowing in it. And these lights condense into a red light group in the space of three feet above the strange stone, which is just the flame like burning seen from afar, and the light source in the whole hall is also coming from here.</p>
<p>Looking at the mysterious and magical spectacle, ghost and Li slowly approached the well, approached the bright and transparent stone, and looked down.</p>
<p>His eyes were impressed by the familiar scene. The fiery magma was roaring down below. It&rsquo;s like a raging ocean tide, surging up and down, splashing magma on the hard rock wall, making a sound.</p>
<p>This fire altar. It was built on a volcano that seemed to be about to erupt.</p>
<p>The spirit Li in the heart a burst of fidgety, involuntarily clenched the fist, even the breath also became heavy. Since approaching these stone carvings of ferocious gods on the ground, it seems that these unheard of and unseen images have triggered the violence in the deep heart, or these gods are just ferocious evil spirits at all. He was more and more interested in killing people, but it was strange. He was able to keep his mind awake, which was not as crazy as usual.</p>
<p>However, although other people are awake, the pain caused by the strong violence in the body is even worse. If someone is standing nearby, he can see that in the eyes of ghost Li at the moment, red mans are big and prosperous, just like evil spirits.</p>
<p>At the time of self support, the ash on his shoulder suddenly squeaked twice, and jumped down to the strange stone.</p>
<p>The spirit was shocked. There was blood red light flowing in the stone. Even though he had been studying the magic heavenly book for many years, he felt that the evil power was very important. He immediately reached out to intercept it and said: &ldquo;ash, be careful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But after all, Xiaohui jumped down suddenly, and the sharp reaction was a little late, and the catch was empty. Only see small ash in the air body stretch, only the eyes and the general red light flashing.</p>
<p>At that time, in a flash, the ash has fallen on the strange stone, making a &ldquo;bang&rdquo; sound.</p>
<p>In an instant, the red light refracted through the layers of strange rocks in the volcanic well is blocked by the small ash. Almost at the same time, the red light in the mid air condenses into a red light group like a flame. Because of the loss of the light source, it suddenly disappears.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the whole world seemed to be quiet.</p>
<p>In a flash, the whole altar hall lost its light completely, and darkness covered all places.</p>
<p>Ghost Li stopped breathing and stared at Xiaohui.</p>
<p>It lies on the strange stone. It seems that there is nothing wrong for the time being. The red light refracted from the well is now blocked by it and reflected on its belly. It is very delicate.</p>
<p>The red awn flows like blood, flickering slightly on its body. Little gray body slowly began to make sound, like bone and joint percussion harsh sound.</p>
<p>Kaka, Kaka</p>
<p>Ghostly stepped forward a step, staring at the little ash, with a faint sense of bad foreboding in his heart.</p>
<p>Little gray slowly turned his head, his eyes had changed into red, so dazzling in the dark!</p>
<p>At the next moment, the change is already sudden!</p>
<p>In the main hall, there was a bleak roar in the dark, which came from the vast. The stone carvings on the ground around them glowed red, one after another.</p>
<p>When the eighth stone carving of the evil spirit was also lit up, the bleak roar echoed in the main hall had turned to be shrill and full of the whole space. I don&rsquo;t know when it started, but there was wind on the hall.</p>
<p>The ghost picked up the ash. Stick to yourself. Almost at the same time, with a loud bang, all the stone carvings are shining. In a moment, the red light seems to be tangible. Rising from the stone carvings of the evil spirits, while keeping the original shape of the stone carvings, the plane formed by red light condenses into the sky.</p>
<p>One by one, the evil spirits turn into red light and condense in the sky. At this moment, ghost Li finally sees the crooked stone carving around the periphery of the evil spirits stone carving.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a huge totem of fire that wraps all the demons in it. With the more and more fierce wind, the strange aperture slowly rose, and a moment later, it was higher than the ghost&rsquo;s head, and stopped above him and Xiaohui.</p>
<p>The ghost Li looks up, in the palm unconsciously already had the cold sweat.</p>
<p>One by one ferocious looking ferocious gods are like resurrected at the moment, laughing at the sky in the huge flame like blood red aperture. At this moment, the darkness in the hall has already been expelled, and all places are illuminated by this dazzling aperture.</p>
<p>The red diaphragm began to rotate slowly, and the speed gradually increased, along with the wind speed on the main hall. Ghost Li is in the center of this storm. His clothes were hunting and his face was gradually pale.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that he&rsquo;s still not moving.</p>
<p>The strange atmosphere in the air is getting heavier and heavier. It seems that there is a mysterious and ferocious smile in the sharp wind, just like the ghost of Jiuyou comes to the world.</p>
<p>The red diaphragm finally rose to the dome, and it turned faster and faster under the simple stone plate. The red light was like rain, like the blood rain in hell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boom!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the rapid rotation to the point of almost too much to see, suddenly, the red aperture suddenly stops, without warning, suddenly stops. The next moment. Above the blood red flame, if the huge stone slab is called away, it will take the Fire Totem as the center to retreat around.</p>
<p>In the blood red light, two groups of hot eyes lit up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roar&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A deep roar came from the red light above. In an instant, the whole hall seemed to be shaking, and all the gods were shouting together!</p>
<p>The huge body with incredible heat, the whole body up and down like a burning flame, a giant beast from above straight down.</p>
<p>The pupils in the eyes of the ghost shriveled in a moment, and the foot made great efforts to absorb the soul. The whole man drifted out backward, avoiding the thundering downward attack.</p>
<p>The huge beast, surrounded by the burning fire, roared angrily and turned slowly to stare at the ghost.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why. Suddenly, GUI Li feels dry in his mouth.</p>
<p>Like those strange stone carvings, he has never seen, even in the book, the fire beast in front of him. The giant body is several feet tall, four legs are thick, and the sharp claws are on the end. Once it moves on the ground, it will leave deep scratches on the hard red rock.</p>
<p>On its huge head, there is a big mouth full of sharp teeth. In one pair of big eyes, there are no eyes, but two burning flames. Moreover, on the surface of the monster&rsquo;s huge body, there was a blazing fire everywhere, as if the fire was a part of its body.</p>
<p>Before it gets close, it is unbearable to be sprayed by the hot air.</p>
<p>And in the middle of the air, the huge Fire Totem condensed by the red light seems to have been controlled by some inexplicable force and fell down, standing behind the beast, slowly rotating. All the demons on it seem to be staring at the one man and one monkey who disturb the spirit like the flame beast.</p>
<p>Little ash was held in his arms by the ghost, but his eyes were fixed on the strange beast. The red light in his eyes was not weak but full.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roar!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fire beast roared again and came again. This time, however, he didn&rsquo;t escape. In fact, the size of this beast is too large, and there are not many places left for the spacious hall to stand like this.</p>
<p>I saw the soul devouring like being manipulated by an invisible hand, floating to the ghost. The face of the ghost is gloomy. Put the ash on his shoulder, and then dash his hands in the air after the soul eating stick. A eight diagrams pattern appears on the blood eating bead in front of the soul eating stick, which is magnified in an instant and faces the fire beast.</p>
<p>A moment later, the strange animal collided with the eight trigrams of ghost and fierce sacrifice in mid air.</p>
<p>At this moment, if someone in Qingyun gate is here, he will definitely shout out. This is the authentic Qingyun gate&rsquo;s secret method of &ldquo;taijixuanqingdao&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The power of Taoist true method is naturally extraordinary. The fire beast looks like a powerful attack, but it is born and stopped by it, and its huge body falls on the ground.</p>
<p>But almost at the same time, a strong force rebounded back, and the whole body was shocked. The power of the fire beast&rsquo;s attack is even more powerful than that of the ordinary cultivation experts.</p>
<p>Although the flame beast was stopped, it was only seen that its giant was raised sharply. Its eyes were full of flames. It was clear that it had not been hurt. Instead, it seemed to be more angry. A huge roar came again. The huge Fire Totem behind it is also slowly spinning up.</p>
<p>The ghost Li eyebrow tightly wrinkles, is waiting for the hand, suddenly the shoulder one light, the monkey small ash actually jumped up, left his body, straight to that flame beast to rush.</p>
<p>The fright of ghost and Li was not trivial. He lost his voice and said: &ldquo;little grey, no&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The flame beast suddenly saw something coming. It was surprised and roared. The body that had just jumped up stopped for a while. We should see this thing clearly.</p>
<p>Only in the red light, a pair of monkey eyes have been completely bright red monkey ash jumped in the air.</p>
<p>When his body, which was almost insignificant compared with the flame beast, jumped to the top, it suddenly stopped in the air.</p>
<p>Just like the feeling that the moment is completely still, when the monkey stops in the middle of the sky, the hall, which is just full of flames and monsters, is suddenly quiet.</p>
<p>Carden!</p>
<p>A crisp voice slowly spread away. Among the countless red lights, a golden light rises.</p>
<p>Xiaohui&rsquo;s whole body stretches out, his eyes are closed tightly, and his whole body slowly emits a light golden light, which looks like a god Buddha. Between his eyebrows and on his forehead, the dark trace suddenly began to wriggle. A moment later, Xiaohui suddenly raised his head, clasped his hands and roared to the sky.</p>
<p>Standing in the back, he suddenly stopped and looked at the ash in the air.</p>
<p>The dark mark between the two eyebrows wriggled more and more fiercely. Suddenly, the little ash screamed again, accompanied by a sound like tearing, a cry in the dark. The dark mark split away, and a brilliant golden light shone from it.</p>
<p>Third eye!</p>
<p>Three eyed monkey!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s said that the unique and strange beast of the spirit of all things, just in this flaming hall, suddenly transformed! (to be continued. )</p>
