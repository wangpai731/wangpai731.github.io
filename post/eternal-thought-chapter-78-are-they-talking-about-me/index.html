<p>After hearing Qian song&rsquo;s words, all the people in the auction house showed interest and looked at them together.</p>
<p>However, most of the inner disciples who have been trained in the eighth floor of condensate gas pay no attention. Some are talking to each other, while others are keeping their eyes closed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can have a look at this pill, and then Qian will tell you the price.&rdquo; Qian song looks even more strange. After a dry cough, he immediately walks out of the light door beside him and walks out of a young woman with a wooden box.</p>
<p>The interest of the people around him became more and more. They wanted to know what kind of Ziqi shenglingdan was, which could make Qian song look like this.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun was more nervous. She stood there breathless. Looking at the auction table, the young woman slowly raised the box and took out a dark purple pill.</p>
<p>Her hands were white. Compared with this pill, she immediately made the pill more obvious. Even in the twinkling of light, she could clearly see three silver lines shining, and Next to the holy stripe, a little turtle is carved on it.</p>
<p>This moment, countless people stare, slowly around a silent, but soon, bursts of noise, suddenly spread out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three times! Oh, my God, I read it right! &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m crazy. I&rsquo;ve refined a second-order elixir three times! It&rsquo;s all successful</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too crazy to make the purple Qi into the spirit elixir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sound was so high that all the disciples were shocked. In this moment, the sound of uproar spread throughout the auction house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn it, who did it, such a loser!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three times of alchemy, what a hobby it must be to have such abnormal ideas!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Especially those inner disciples who didn&rsquo;t pay attention to the auction were also surprised to see them. When they saw the two silver lines on the pills, they all stared and took a breath. Some even stood up and were stunned.</p>
<p>You should know that the success rate of soul refining is not high. One time is good, but two times is poor. As for three times That depends on luck, even the master, also dare not say that three times will succeed.</p>
<p>In Lingxi sect, too many people in the spirit refining three times, the magic weapon is broken, heartache, so that they love and hate the soul refining. If someone around them succeeds, they will surely attract countless admiration.</p>
<p>If a magic weapon is refined three times, the magic weapon will be much more powerful, enough to shock other people&rsquo;s minds and be pursued by countless people. Now They actually saw a pill, refining three times!</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just a second-order pill!</p>
<p>That kind of feeling is like a beautiful pattern. If it grows on a butterfly, it is very beautiful. But if it grows on a pig Then waste!!</p>
<p>They looked complicated and had endless thoughts in their hearts. Even some of them held their fists and their faces were full of blue veins. Especially those inner disciples of ziding mountain, what they learned was soul refining, which was even more painful at the moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so lucky that I went to refine the elixir and showed it here. Damn it, if I had this kind of luck, it would be a treasure for three times of soul refining!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even those foundation building monks looked strange in the attic and were surprised by the large amount of the pill.</p>
<p>When Bai Xiaochun saw this scene on the balcony, he took a breath. He was shocked. He looked at those angry people with red faces and thick necks. He felt as if he was Some over, quickly put out a look of indignation, pointing to the pills on the auction table, very angry low roar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a loser. I&rsquo;m a loser!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sun Chen in the distance is smiling bitterly at the moment. When he got the pill, he felt the same way. At the moment, he suddenly saw the appearance of Bai Xiaochun on the balcony in the distance. He was stunned for a moment, and his forehead was sweating</p>
<p>At this time, in the crowd near the front of the auction table, someone with sharp eyes saw the pattern of a small turtle on the pills in the hands of the young woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why? How can this little turtle look familiar&hellip; &quot; As soon as he uttered his words, people around him looked at the past one after another. Just now they were all attracted by the three silver lines, and they did not pay attention to other places. At this moment, they immediately saw the pattern of the little turtle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The little turtle I remember, isn&rsquo;t this the little tortoise with the first ten steles in Wanyao Pavilion of Xiangyun mountain, right? &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As like as two peas, the charm is the same. By a man</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could it be that mysterious little tortoise of Tianjiao mountain in Xiangyun mountain was the one who refined this pill and went crazy to refine spirit for three times?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly, there were more people around. All of them were disciples of Lingxi sect, and many of them were from Xiangyun mountain. At the moment, they all noticed the little turtle and immediately exclaimed.</p>
<p>Gradually, more and more people saw the little tortoise and took a breath one by one. Countless people directly stood up. We should know that the little tortoise in Xiangyun mountain, though disappearing for a long time, has a great reputation. It has been widely spread in the clan, and people often guess who the other is.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is no answer until now, the other party is too mysterious, mysterious to the extent that no one knows, is more low-key, as if the character is indifferent, do not care about all foreign affairs.</p>
<p>And today, actually Again!</p>
<p>And as soon as it appeared, it was in this way that it shocked the auction house and everyone.</p>
<p>Zhou Xinqi in the crowd, at the moment, her eyes suddenly show the essence, staring at pills, chest ups and downs, strong mood changes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You finally appear, such as your arrogance, can not disappear in the sea of people, you are good at hiding, but your talent has decided, no matter how you hide, you will show up, I will find you!&rdquo; Zhou Xinqi takes a deep breath. She has been looking for the little turtle secretly for a long time, and once doubted Bai Xiaochun, but she quickly denies it. In her heart, she has outlined a figure of the little turtle, which is a calm and persistent person who will not be tired of fame and wealth.</p>
<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s not Zhou Xinqi&rsquo;s own opinion. This is almost everyone&rsquo;s consensus. Even Hou Xiaomei thinks so. The big point is that Bai Xiaochun brags about big and small turtles.</p>
<p>Even people have analyzed why the other side painted tortoise, and the answer is that this person is indifferent, but he has great ambition. To use tortoise as a metaphor for his pill, it can last for thousands of years.</p>
<p>Hou Xiaomei is not far away. At the moment, her eyes are wide open, and her eyes instantly show countless adoration. Because of Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s teaching, now she is the most worshipping person in the clan. She even has many friends with her to form a League of little turtles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, it&rsquo;s a little turtle!&rdquo; Hou Xiaomei almost jumped up and pointed to the auction table in surprise.</p>
<p>The voice of uproar, at this moment, because of the appearance of the little turtle, immediately caused a sensation, but this time did not question, and then to scold, but all in the thoughtful, the mind was shocked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the ultimate pursuit of him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This man is arrogant and arrogant. He is refining elixir not for business, but for the essence of medicine, for exploration and persistence!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even those inner disciples who had been suffering from heartache were all looking at each other, taking deep breath one after another and looking at the pill with dignity. At the moment, no one thought that the other side was a show off alchemy for three times.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Tianjiao. I understand that this man is not insane, nor is he showing off again. He has great ambition. This is the performance of persistence. He is persistent in making his pills reach the highest quality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very powerful, also very amazing, this persistence, this perseverance, this kind of persistence for the perfect pill, is worth learning from all of us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Refining three times can improve three qualities, that is to say This pill itself is a middle-class pill. He is far away from us in refining medicine. He is worthy of being a little turtle! &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This pill is worth remembering. I&rsquo;ll order it!&rdquo; Those inner disciples showed a strong light in their eyes. The pill was not suitable for them to swallow, but it made them feel a spirit on it.</p>
<p>They looked at the pills, as if to see a indifferent fame and wealth, obsession, the pursuit of the ultimate medicine of Tianjiao figure.</p>
<p>Seeing the change of the tone of the people around him, Bai Xiaochun was filled with indignation with the crowd. At the moment, she raised her hands and opened her eyes. She looked at the people and listened to their words. Bai Xiaochun suddenly blushed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They Are they talking about me&hellip; &quot; Bai Xiaochun trembled with excitement. He didn&rsquo;t show up. He was so excellent. At the moment, he suddenly realized that he wanted to shout and tell everyone that he was the tortoise master who moved the world!</p>
<p>At this time, Qian song on the auction platform coughed and showed a smile in his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now that everyone can see it, this symbolic elixir costs 500 spirit stones at a low price, and the price is no less than 50 spirits each time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This price, let Bai Xiaochun take a breath, this is already sky high, the vast majority of the disciples, simply can not afford to buy, but then Bai Xiaochun was stunned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Six hundred spirit stones!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seven hundred spirit stone, this pill has the spirit of medicine, I am determined to get it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;800, who is better than me?&rdquo; Those inner disciples immediately offered the price, and the voice spread all around. For a moment, it ignited the boiling of the place.</p>
<p>After that, a large number of offers continued to spread, and soon reached the price of 1500 spirit stone. Bai Xiaochun was thirsty and short of breath. He couldn&rsquo;t believe it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crazy, crazy Be a little bit crazy come on. You are all good Bai Xiaochun spoke excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;1800 spirit stones.&rdquo; Zhou Xinqi suddenly opened her mouth in the crowd. When her voice came out, she attracted countless people to see her. Bai Xiaochun also quickly looked to cheer Zhou Xinqi.</p>
<p>This price is already the limit for the inner disciples. Although many of them are unwilling to accept it, they can only sigh. After all, it was Zhou Xinqi who offered the price, and she herself was Tianjiao. She showed her determination to buy the pill. Everyone was in the same school, and it was not easy to continue to compete.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun was also very satisfied with the price. He wished he could not go to replace Qian song to make the decision. But just as four weeks later, the voice of a young girl, proud and unconvinced, suddenly came out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I Hou Xiaomei belongs to Xiuzhen family. Some of them are spirit stones. I open 3000 spirit stones!&rdquo;</p>
