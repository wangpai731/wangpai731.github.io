      <p>Go to &ldquo;small talk → net&rdquo; to provide you with wonderful novels to read. A kind of Go to &ldquo;small talk → net&rdquo; to provide you with wonderful novels to read.</p>
<p>This time, the trial of promotion from a mixed servant to a layman was over. As Hou Xiaomei and Hou Xiaomei stepped on the top of the mountain and gradually left, Zhang daphou looked at Hou Xiaomei&rsquo;s back, touched her plump chin, and his face was meaningful. [love to go to the small</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, white, small, pure&hellip;&rdquo; With that, he aimed at Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>At this time, Bai Xiaochun is also looking at Hou Xiaomei&rsquo;s back. Her heart is extremely complicated. Especially when she hears Zhang daphou&rsquo;s words and sees Zhang daphou&rsquo;s eyes peeking at herself, Bai Xiaochun can&rsquo;t help shouting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look at me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seeing that Bai Xiaochun is angry, Zhang daphou quickly laughs and takes out his pocket full of Lingshi to change the topic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, let&rsquo;s count the spirit stones. It&rsquo;s big this time. Ha ha, this method is really good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The spirit stone has what good number, count to go not just those.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun snorted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand this ninth younger martial brother. You are looking at the spirit stone and counting the life.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s hard for Zhang Da pang to say such a perceptive word. Bai Xiaochun is stunned and learns from Zhang&rsquo;s appearance to count the spirit stones. Finally, he is really bored and throws it to Zhang daphou.</p>
<p>At this time, the trail of light shining, everyone in front of a flower, when clear, have arrived at the foot of the mountain.</p>
<p>The middle-aged deacon, who had opened the road of trial before, looked strange when he saw Bai Xiaochun. After a while, he shook his head and ignored it. He thought that it was better to leave the matter concerning the fire stove room to zongmen.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun was still a little nervous. They looked at each other, coughed with each other immediately, left quickly, and went straight to the fire kitchen.</p>
<p>Zhang Da Pang counted the spirit stones by himself, again and again, until he returned to the fire stove room, several other fat elder martial brothers also came back, all of them were happy, and they were very proud after meeting each other.</p>
<p>After getting his share, Bai Xiaochun is still in the thatched cottage. His pursuit is long life. If it was not for the purchase of herbs for longevity pills, he would not have come up with such an idea to earn spiritual stones.</p>
<p>This night, all the people in the fire kitchen room didn&rsquo;t sleep well. After they became rich, Zhang daphou and others were excited for a night. They recalled the days when their pockets were shriveled a few years ago, and then they thought about the future. Later, they were afraid and worried, so they all lost sleep.</p>
<p>And Bai Xiaochun here, thinking of longevity pills, the same insomnia.</p>
<p>When the next day came, with the fermentation of the fire stove trial road blocking the door, in all the miscellaneous service areas on the South Bank of lingxizong, it spread from ten to 100, and in the end, almost no one knew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you heard that the fire kitchen has done a great job!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are they so poor and crazy that they actually do such things? Oh, my God, they sell the number of disciples from other schools! It&rsquo;s too much. Why didn&rsquo;t I think of this idea before? &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard for a long time that everyone in the fireplace has a good reputation. They are all related to the family. Otherwise, how could everyone eat so heinous?&rdquo; In the mixed service area, all the rooms, all the people, on this day, almost all of them were talking about the fire kitchen.</p>
<p>In recent days, the fire stove has been keeping a low profile. Almost all of us never go out alone. Until a few days later, when Bai Xiaochun was pouring rice soup into a big bowl with a thick mouth bottom, she suddenly heard the sound of footsteps on the road outside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the people from the fire stove room come out, the supervisor&rsquo;s room is ordered to come to investigate the matter of your trial road!&rdquo; When the cold voice suddenly came, the door of the fire stove room was kicked open directly.</p>
<p>With a clang, the gate was kicked, and more than a dozen servant disciples dressed in the clothes of the supervisor&rsquo;s room rushed in from the door. The first one was the man with a strong back and a strong back who had made his way for Xu Baocai.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said why I heard crows crow again this morning. It turns out that Chen Fei is here again.&rdquo; Zhang daphou and Bai Xiaochun looked at each other, pretending that nothing was wrong. Together with several other fat men, they calmly looked at the people in the supervisory room who were coming fiercely.</p>
<p>Chen Fei sneered. He glanced at Zhang Da Pang, and then looked at Xiaochun&rsquo;s eyes. All of a sudden, his eyebrows were slightly wrinkled. The people in the fire kitchen room in front of him were so calm.</p>
<p>When he came, he was very excited. He thought that he had finally grasped the painful foot of the fire kitchen room, and could knock down the fire kitchen room in one fell swoop and end the years of fighting between the two houses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretend to be calm!&rdquo; Chen Fei&rsquo;s heart sneers, his eyes show a fierce color, moribund mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huozaofang, Chen asked you if nine of you had ever participated in the test of being promoted to a layman a few days ago!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Zhang said with a big smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just take part, take it away!&rdquo; Chen Fei didn&rsquo;t talk much nonsense. He raised a finger in his right hand, and immediately after him, more than a dozen servants in the supervisor&rsquo;s room rushed out, holding chains in his hands, as if to tie the fire stove.</p>
<p>Seeing this, Bai Xiaochun beamed out his words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The supervisor&rsquo;s office is in charge of everything, which limits our qualification to be a layman. It&rsquo;s really prestige.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Chen Fei sees Bai Xiaochun, he can&rsquo;t help but see the scene of Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s flying sword that day. When he waves his hands, the people around him stop. He stares at Bai Xiaochun and gradually narrows his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Younger martial brother Bai, since you are unconvinced, Chen will ask you one more question. You are burning the stove, blocking the exit on the way of trial and selling quota in public. Since you have done it, dare you admit it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Admittedly, we did it!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun is very calm, a pair of clever appearance, nodded repeatedly, also pointed to Zhang Da fat them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They did it, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. We did it all. What happened?&rdquo; Zhang daphou and others all admit it with a smile.</p>
<p>This scene changed Chen Fei&rsquo;s face. He didn&rsquo;t expect that the people in the fire kitchen room actually admitted it. In his mind, this is something that people in the fire kitchen room have to admit after a hard fight.</p>
<p>At the moment, I feel strange. I have a bad feeling in my heart, so I don&rsquo;t speak much and roar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good, good, since admitted, also save Chen continued to ask, so follow me to the law enforcement hall, if anyone dares to resist, according to the door rules, will be expelled from the clan!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chen Fei said, his body jumped up and went straight to Bai Xiaochun. All the people behind him rushed to him.</p>
<p>But at this time, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s right hand suddenly lifted up, and a sword light flew out of his sleeve. The colorful wooden sword flew out in a flash, whistling between the supervisor&rsquo;s room and the fire stove room. The cold light was so strong that Chen Fei&rsquo;s face was suddenly ugly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bai Xiaochun, you dare to resist!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Senior brother Chen, the supervisor&rsquo;s office has the qualification to inquire. Where does it come from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you all admit that you have broken the rules. Of course I have the qualification to arrest you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what rules we have broken?&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun asked with a smile. Zhang daphou and others also squinted and sneered at Chen Fei.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have violated the rules of the gate by selling the quota for the outside door Yes Chen feizheng said, suddenly a meal, then the face color changes rapidly, gradually forehead actually out of a cold sweat.</p>
<p>He was shocked to find that there was no saying in the door rules that people were not allowed to sell places outside the door on the trial road After all, few people can think of this method. Even if they think of it, they don&rsquo;t have the courage to do it</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elder martial brother Chen, why are you sweating? Which one did we commit? Do you mean that we didn&rsquo;t violate the rules of the school, but did you cheat the law enforcement hall and avenge yourself and come here to lynch us? Elder martial brother Chen, you have committed Article 11 of volume 9 of the gate rules. According to the rules, the punishment is not small! &quot; Bai Xiaochun put on a surprised look, after a question, the voice is more and more loud, the heart secretly comfortable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re talking nonsense. I&rsquo;m&hellip;&rdquo; At this moment, not only Chen Fei&rsquo;s face changed, but the other office workers behind him also realized the problem, and their faces changed in an instant.</p>
<p>At the same time, Zhang daphou raised his hands with a grim smile and rubbed his hands in front of him. Several other fat elder martial brothers showed fierce in their eyes and walked towards the supervisors&rsquo; room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chen Fei, the law enforcement hall is responsible for your violation of the door rules. Now we have huozaofang, the gate forged by countless martyrs in those years, how to compensate? You have to give us an account today.&rdquo; Zhang daphou&rsquo;s smile is ferocious, and his momentum suddenly rises at this moment.</p>
<p>Since they dare to block the door on the road of trial, they are naturally well prepared. When Bai Xiaochun put forward the idea two months ago, they had already broken the door rules, and this was the great event.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fight!&rdquo; With the spread of Zhang&rsquo;s words, his flesh mountain like figure makes Chen Fei and other people tremble.</p>
<p>For a moment, the sound of fighting in the yard was thumping, and Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s body was shaking. She was also habitually standing on the fence wall beside the yard. With her small sleeves and hands on her back, she pretended to look at the distance deeply, showing that she was lonely and retired after success.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My white little Chun shot my fingers, and the supervisor&rsquo;s room went up in smoke&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
