      <p>　　</p>
<p>For a long time, the old man with white beard was the first to react. He jumped up to the challenge arena and came to Chu Yuhong. After a careful inspection, he found that he was in good condition and showed no signs of poisoning. It seemed that he was severely damaged by the magic weapon of the immortal family and his inner organs were severely shaken.</p>
<p>He frowned, stood up and looked at Zhang Xiaofan. He couldn&rsquo;t help but stare at the young man. He also glanced at the black burning stick tightly held by Zhang Xiaofan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won.&rdquo; The old man with white beard pressed down the doubts in his heart, and he was calm.</p>
<p>Dahua, the disciple of Chaoyang peak, was in front of us, but there was nothing to say. It was just that Chu Yuhong had lost so inexplicably. It was unimaginable. It was clear that the victory was in hand. Suddenly, he lost with a roar, which was unacceptable.</p>
<p>At this time, Zeng Shushu also looked silly, but when he heard the three words said by the old man with white beard, he rushed to Zhang Xiaofan, slapped him on the shoulder, and laughed loudly: &ldquo;good boy, you are hidden!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan turned around, his face like frost, and stared at him coldly.</p>
<p>Those cold but black eyes!</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu suddenly felt a cold in his heart and said, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter, Xiao Fan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Zhang Xiaofan was asked by him, his body shook, as if he thought of something. His eyes softened, and the strange cold feeling in his eyes disappeared. He replied to his usual feeling, as if he was still confused, saying: &ldquo;no, nothing, I&rsquo;m ok, what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu stares at me and says, &ldquo;why don&rsquo;t you ask me why you didn&rsquo;t know you won this game?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was startled and said, &ldquo;what, did I win? Did I win?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu was more frightened by him. His face turned white for a while. He reached out his hand and measured it on his forehead. He said: &ldquo;bitter, are you confused by the fire just now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan grabs his head and then sees several disciples of Chaoyang peak on the platform in the distance carrying the unconscious Chu Yuhong down. Some of them look at themselves hatefully.</p>
<p>Looking at those people go further and further, Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s mind, the scene of fighting just now clearly emerged. Subconsciously, he lowered his head and looked at the black burning stick in his hand.</p>
<p>The ugly short stick was still in his hands, but in Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s eyes, the burning stick that accompanied him for two years had never been so strange, as if it had returned to the valley many years ago and reproduced the terrible nightmare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pa&rdquo; is actually Zeng Shushu watching Zhang Xiaofan in a daze, knocking his head with a fan in his hand and saying: &ldquo;what do you want</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan shook his head, sighed, and received the stick in his arms, saying, &ldquo;nothing, let&rsquo;s go. By the way, how can you come to see me compete? &quot;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu glanced at the torch in his arms and said: &ldquo;before the contest started, I ran to see you. Unexpectedly, I saw a good play. Eh, what do you call your three eyed monkey today&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan said, &ldquo;Xiaohui.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shu said, &ldquo;yes, Xiaohui, why didn&rsquo;t you see Xiaohui today?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan shook his head and said, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen its shadow in the morning. Maybe it&rsquo;s where he and rhubarb have slipped to play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu called out, &ldquo;ah!&rdquo; with a look of regret. Zhang Xiaofan could not help but guess that this guy was coming to see his own competition. In fact, he didn&rsquo;t just want to see Xiaohui?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the distance, there was a big noise suddenly. They heard it from a long distance. They looked up and saw that in the middle of the distance, the disciples of Qingyun sect surrounded by the &ldquo;Qian&rdquo; platform, and the exclamation came one after another.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan hasn&rsquo;t responded yet. Zeng Shushu has already fallen and cried, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s too bad. I just look at you and forget the most important thing.&rdquo; Said pulling Zhang Xiaofan to run.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan didn&rsquo;t know why. He ran and asked, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu said regretfully, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s competition there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan can&rsquo;t help smiling, but also can&rsquo;t help but feel a touch in his heart. He looks up to the friend who has only known him for two days. Just now, under the cold challenge arena, he can&rsquo;t see his peers, senior brothers, but only this person stands on his side alone under the platform full of disciples of Chaoyang peak.</p>
<p>A warm, slowly from the heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master Zeng&hellip; Book, thank you for coming to see me just now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu, who was running at a gallop, froze for a moment, slowed down his pace, looked back at Zhang Xiaofan, and then smiled: &ldquo;ha ha, little things, if you are too moved, why don&rsquo;t you put Xiaohui&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu shook his head on one side of his body and ran with Zhang Xiaofan, who ran as fast as the wind.</p>
<p>　　※※※</p>
<p>When they ran to the nearest place, they saw a group of Qingyun disciples had dispersed. Most of them were very excited and argued with each other fiercely. They looked up and saw that there was no one over the platform, but the wooden platform was scarred. It seemed that the competition was over.</p>
<p>Zeng Shuzhu turns his eyes, pulls Zhang Xiaofan to turn left and right, and wears them around in the crowd. Within a moment, he finds the target - the disciples of Fenghui peak.</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu hurriedly leaned up, and those disciples of fenghuifeng all laughed when they saw him. Zhang Xiaofan, one of the tall men who still had some impressions, said with a smile, &ldquo;younger martial brother, don&rsquo;t you say you have to see Lu Xueqi? How can you run without a shadow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu gave a dry cough and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not, er, busy. By the way, what&rsquo;s the result?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A man with thick eyebrows said: &ldquo;needless to say, even the elder martial brother duanlei, who is connected to Tianfeng in changmen, is not an opponent when there is Tianya!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu was surprised and said, &ldquo;even elder martial brother Duan was defeated by her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan said to Zeng Shu, &ldquo;is elder martial brother duanlei very powerful?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu nodded: &ldquo;yes, Duan Lei is a very outstanding figure in changmen in recent years, and the call for him to win the championship is also very high.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tall man shook his head and said, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the use? You don&rsquo;t see that. The power of Tianya divine sword is so powerful. After a few flashes of blue light and a few rings, elder martial brother duanlei was defeated.&rdquo; when he said that, he seemed to have more than enough meaning. He sighed and said, &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t believe it. At the end of the day, Lu Xueqi still didn&rsquo;t pull the Tianya divine sword out of the scabbard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu stayed for a while and said, &ldquo;what is the competition? Who else is her opponent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tall man shook his head and said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s not enough. Tianya and other gods have the same power even if they don&rsquo;t pull out the scabbard. It&rsquo;s Lu Xueqi who practices Taoism, but it&rsquo;s really amazing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu looked at him and said, &ldquo;senior brother Gao, how do you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan took a look at the tall man and thought to himself that this surname is worthy of the name. He only listened to the elder martial brother&rsquo;s saying: &ldquo;I also listened to Shifu.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu was surprised and said, &ldquo;my father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Senior brother Gao said: &ldquo;yes, when you didn&rsquo;t come, Shifu was here to watch. At the end of the day, she said that she was afraid that she had built Taiji Xuanqing Taoism to more than eight levels of Yuqing, and that she would not know the Ninth level.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu changed color and stood still for a while, unable to speak. Zhang Xiaofan was surprised. He thought that Zeng Shushu said he didn&rsquo;t care about the result of the test from the first meeting, but he cared about it very much.</p>
<p>At this time, the sound of bell tripod came from afar. It seemed that some of the people headed by senior brother Gao went to the sound place one after another. Zhang Xiaofan stayed in the same place when he read Zeng Shushu and pulled him.</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu wakes up and laughs: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s over. Now we have no hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan really didn&rsquo;t care and said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s over when it&rsquo;s over. By the way, haven&rsquo;t you had a competition yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu took a look at the distance and said, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t started yet, but it&rsquo;s time to go. Where are you going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan thought for a moment and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to report it to Shifu, although I&rsquo;m lucky to win.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu nodded and said, &ldquo;come to me when you are free.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan nodded and said goodbye.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan turns around and walks to the other end of the crowd. Listening to the Qingyun disciples passing by, most of them talk about Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s battle with Duan Lei. After searching for him for a long time, Zhang Xiaofan finally found a group of people in dazhufeng in the West. However, from a distance, he could see that Tian was not easy to get angry, and his face was iron blue. Zhang Xiaofan was always not very afraid of Tian. Now he sneaked over and Tian was not easy to see him. He turned his eyes away and didn&rsquo;t even ask about the result.</p>
<p>Su Ru and Tian ling&rsquo;er, as well as several other disciples of dazhufeng, are all here, except for senior brother song Daren.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan glanced at the crowd and saw that Tian ling&rsquo;er was ok, but the faces of his senior brothers were full of depression. He quietly asked Du Bishu, &ldquo;six senior brothers, what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Du Bishu took a hard look at Tian and saw that he didn&rsquo;t seem to look here. He whispered: &ldquo;we all had a competition just now, except for the elder martial brother. As a result, only the younger martial sister won. The master was angry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan stayed for a while and didn&rsquo;t know what to say.</p>
<p>Su Ru stood by and saw all the disciples trembling. Tian was not easy to look blue. He shook his head and sighed. Wen Sheng said to Zhang Xiaofan, who had just come back, &ldquo;Xiaofan, you are back. What&rsquo;s the result?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan hesitated for a moment and said in a low voice, &ldquo;Shiniang, I am lucky to win.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru: &ldquo;Oh, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. If you lose, you lose. Let&rsquo;s have a look&hellip;&rdquo; her voice suddenly decreased. Looking at Zhang Xiaofan, she was surprised and said, &ldquo;what did you say just now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>All of them, including Tian not easy, turned to look at Zhang Xiaofan at the same time. Zhang&rsquo;s face turned red. But for the first time in his life, he felt a trace of vanity and excitement, especially in the surprised eyes of Tian linger beside Su Ru. He raised his voice a little. Looking at Tian not easy, he said, &ldquo;Shifu, Shiniang, I just won by luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everyone was in a uproar.</p>
<p>　　※※※</p>
<p>Dazhufeng people gathered under the platform of &ldquo;Kun&rdquo; to watch song Daren&rsquo;s final competition. On the stage, song Daren and his opponent are fighting fiercely. The huge sword body of &ldquo;ten tigers&rdquo; fairy sword seems to turn into countless fierce tigers in the mid air, making a loud sound of shaking the earth and mountains. One sword and one sword directly attack the opponent and occupy the advantage.</p>
<p>However, when everyone at dazhufeng was happy, they still couldn&rsquo;t accept what Zhang Xiaofan said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young martial brother, you mean that in the contest just now, you are going to lose. Unexpectedly, the guy named Chu Yuhong of the other side suddenly fell ill and fainted after bleeding all over his face?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, fourth elder martial brother, you and second elder martial brother, Third Elder martial brother and fifth elder martial brother have asked me 22 times. Why are you still asking? Six elder martial brother, please advise them quickly. I&rsquo;m really telling the truth. &quot;</p>
<p>Du Bishu: &ldquo;&hellip; Young martial brother, you mean that in the contest just now, you were going to lose. Unexpectedly, the guy named Chu Yuhong suddenly fell ill and fainted after bleeding all over his face?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan held his head and groaned: &ldquo;yes, the 23rd time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian ling&rsquo;er on one side said angrily, &ldquo;why do you force him so hard? Xiaofan won&rsquo;t panic?&rdquo; Speaking of this, she shook her head and said, &ldquo;but Xiaofan, are you too lucky to believe that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was speechless.</p>
<p>Listen to all the disciples chattering after him, Tian not easy and Su Ru have been looking at the stage. After a while, Su Ru suddenly whispered, &ldquo;what do you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian is not easy to wrinkle eyebrows, the reverse way: &ldquo;said that he wins by ability, do you believe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru smiled and said, &ldquo;our apprentice, luck is not so good!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian doesn&rsquo;t sing easily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boom&rdquo;! With a loud sound, song Daren roared on the stage. He saw the ten tiger fairy sword running through the sky. It was almost invisible to people. He killed the past with invincible momentum like cutting the mountain and cutting the sea. The opponent couldn&rsquo;t resist it at last. He was defeated by this huge force and flew back with blood.</p>
<p>Everyone in dazhufeng was very happy, and Tian&rsquo;s hard face finally showed a smile.</p>
<p>Song Daren stepped down from the challenge arena and returned to the crowd. He first met Tian not easy and Su Ru, and then they warmly congratulated them.</p>
<p>　　&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha ha, lucky! Junior brother six, don&rsquo;t be so sarcastic! Eh, little brother, you are back too. What&rsquo;s the result today? You haven&rsquo;t hurt anything. Alas, you look like this. Listen to the words of the big brother. You&rsquo;re shallow in cultivation. In the future, you&rsquo;ll have a chance not to worry about a victory&hellip; Er, why do you all look at me like this? &quot;</p>
<p>Tian is not easy to turn around first and walk away. Su Ru smiles at the apprentice and follows him. Song Daren is confused and asks the crowd, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian ling&rsquo;er came to him and said it to him. Song Daren turned to him incredulously. Zhang Xiaofan shrunk in fear and said: &ldquo;elder martial brother, I know that my luck is not good, but it is so. I can&rsquo;t&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren&rsquo;s eyes widened: &ldquo;little younger martial brother, you mean that in the contest just now, you were going to lose. Unexpectedly, the guy named Chu Yuhong suddenly fell ill and fainted after bleeding all over his face?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan falls down in despair.</p>
<p>　　※※※</p>
<p>On this day, there are only 16 people participating in the contest. To many people&rsquo;s surprise, Dazhu peak, which has been declining, has occupied three of them, far surpassing the previous one. No matter what happened inside, Tian was not easy to go out, but his face was very bright. On this day, his face was smiling. In the eyes of all the disciples, he talked about it in private.</p>
<p>Du Bishu: &ldquo;look at master&rsquo;s happy appearance. You can raise your eyebrows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wu Dayi: &ldquo;who says not? The eldest brother and the younger sister did give his parents face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He Dazhi: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ashamed to say that although my younger martial sister is younger, she is more competitive than my fourth elder martial brother. Her future is limitless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zheng Dali: &ldquo;don&rsquo;t forget that there is a younger martial brother. He has also entered the third round.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Du Bishu: &ldquo;or let&rsquo;s start gambling again to see how big it is possible for younger martial brother to make another breakthrough. Dare you bet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wu Dayi, he Dazhi, Zheng Dali and LV Daxin: &ldquo;I bet he loses! Double! &quot;</p>
<p>Du Bishu: &ldquo;&hellip; Keke, eh, why is the elder martial brother missing when walking, ah, younger martial brother? Junior sister? What&rsquo;s the matter? Where have all the people gone? &quot;</p>
<p>He Dazhi thought for a moment and said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about little brother and little sister, but I&rsquo;ve guessed something about big brother&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everyone looked at each other and said in unison, &ldquo;elder martial sister xiaozhufeng Wenmin!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren is a big man, but suddenly his body shakes inexplicably. Wen Min looks in his eyes and feels strange. He says, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren frowned and said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. It&rsquo;s suddenly cold on his body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wen Min glanced at him and said angrily, &ldquo;you should not be guilty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren immediately shook his head like a rattle, and even said, &ldquo;where is this matter, where is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wenmin&rsquo;s face slowed down, but he snorted and said, &ldquo;what are you doing secretly running to my little Zhufeng female disciple&rsquo;s room?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a burst of laughter nearby. Song Daren looked around awkwardly. At the end of the contest, most of xiaozhufeng&rsquo;s female disciples came back, smiling one by one and looking at him with interest. Song Daren&rsquo;s face was slightly red. He turned the topic aside and said, &ldquo;Oh,&hellip; Why didn&rsquo;t you see my little younger martial sister?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wen Min said with a smile, &ldquo;your little sister is born beautiful and lively, so she has been invited out for a long time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren was surprised and said, &ldquo;what, who asked him out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wen Min shook her head and said, &ldquo;if you see your sister ling&rsquo;er, you&rsquo;d better advise her to be careful tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren talked about Tian ling&rsquo;er, but he was not so embarrassed to Wen Min alone. His words were more fluent. He frowned and said, &ldquo;I know that younger martial sister Lu Xueqi and younger martial sister Lu Xueqi from xiaozhufeng will have a competition tomorrow. We two have been making good friends with each other. We should be OK. Besides, seven martial arts are just a competition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wen Min glanced at him and said lightly, &ldquo;your mother, uncle Su, is very kind to my master, but my master is very unhappy with your master. I&rsquo;m afraid that I still blame your master for turning away our uncle Su!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren is still waiting to say something, but Wen Min looks around at the little Zhufeng female disciple again. All the girls are quiet and look at this place. Song Daren is surprised: &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wenmin looked at him, hesitated for a moment, and then said: &ldquo;brother song, sister Lu is different from us. She has a strange temperament, but master dotes on her very much. After entering the challenge arena, it&rsquo;s hard to say anything. &quot;</p>
<p>Song Daren&rsquo;s face changed and said, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wenmin shut up and didn&rsquo;t go on.</p>
