There was a knock on the door, but there was no one outside. Grimly frowned, walked over and opened the door.
Standing at the door was a 13-4-year-old Miao boy with a childish look on his face. He carried a basket in his hand with some meat, wine and vegetables in the middle. It seems that the leader of tumagu clan sent someone to deliver food.
The boy handed the basket over and nodded grimly, &amp;ldquo;thank you very much." /><meta name="keywords" content="Hugo, theme, even" />

      <p>&ldquo;Dong, Dong, Dong&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a knock on the door, but there was no one outside. Grimly frowned, walked over and opened the door.</p>
<p>Standing at the door was a 13-4-year-old Miao boy with a childish look on his face. He carried a basket in his hand with some meat, wine and vegetables in the middle. It seems that the leader of tumagu clan sent someone to deliver food.</p>
<p>The boy handed the basket over and nodded grimly, &ldquo;thank you very much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy grinned, but only made a &ldquo;Yiya&rdquo; voice. He was stunned. Such a young man was a mute who could not speak. No wonder he just knocked on the door and didn&rsquo;t speak.</p>
<p>He could not help but look at the young man again. He saw that his clothes were patched. It was obvious that he had worn them for a long time, which was quite different from the Miao people who had just seen in qilidong street. He thought that the young man had a low status here. He was afraid that he was still an orphan.</p>
<p>At the thought of the word &ldquo;orphan&rdquo; in his mind, GUI Li was shocked for a moment. However, after smiling at him for a while, the young man turned around and walked away. Seeing his back, he was not sad and depressed, but quite a bit happy.</p>
<p>The ghost looked at the boy&rsquo;s back gradually away. Suddenly, he felt a sense of boredom in his heart. With a sigh, he turned into the room and slammed the door.</p>
<p>With the deepening of the west, the sky gradually darkened, and lights were lit up one by one in the numerous Miao people&rsquo;s houses in Qili cave.</p>
<p>The yellow light from one window to another, flickering in the dark, is like silent eyes in the night.</p>
<p>That each family&rsquo;s family, under each lamp light&rsquo;s people, may have own mood and the life!</p>
<p>GUI Li stood at the window and looked at the Miao people&rsquo;s residence in the distance without saying a word.</p>
<p>The night wind gradually blows, and from time to time the Miao people&rsquo;s joyful laughter comes from the distance of qilidong. In the meantime, there are dogs barking in some places, but these sounds come from the wind. On the contrary, it highlights the peace in this land.</p>
<p>Perhaps these ordinary Miao people, on the contrary, are more happy than those who practice Taoism.</p>
<p>He closed the window slowly and turned around. Isolate yourself from the outside world.</p>
<p>He turned his head and was stunned. A moment ago, Xiaobai, who was still sleeping quietly, sat up and leaned against the wall beside the bed and looked at him in silence.</p>
<p>He gave her a sharp look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you awake</p>
<p>Xiaobai laughed and rubbed his forehead gently with his hand and said, &ldquo;do you have tea? Pour me a cup! I have a headache. &quot;</p>
<p>GUI Li went to the table, poured a cup of water, handed it to her, and said, &ldquo;Miao people, where do you have tea, drink some water!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaobai nodded, took the cup and took a few drinks. Spirit seems to be one of the shock, long a breath, and then to the ghost of a glance, the way: &ldquo;your heart is not in blame me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a wry smile, he shook his head and said, &ldquo;without you, I would not have known that the great wizard in the Miao people might cure Biyao. Forget it, we will see him again tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaobai nodded and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sober after I&rsquo;m drunk. Have you ever seen the great wizard of the Miao people? &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he did. He admitted that he did know how to revive the spirit, but he had to ask your origin to find out how you knew the secret. Only if you will As he said this, he could not help but worry that Jiuwei Tianhu&rsquo;s identity was willing to be disclosed or not, and his reaction to Xiaobai was uncertain.</p>
<p>Xiaobai was silent for a moment and said faintly, &ldquo;after dawn tomorrow, I will go to see him with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He nodded grimly. Just want to say something more, Xiaobai suddenly laughed and said, &ldquo;look at this monkey, it&rsquo;s more drunk than I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ghost Li to still lie in Xiaobai side, limbs spread out, big sleep of the small ash looked at, shake his head no language.</p>
<p>Xiaobai reached out and touched Xiaohui&rsquo;s head. His eyes fell on the third eye in the middle of Xiaohui&rsquo;s forehead. After pondering for a moment, he raised his head and said to the ghost: &ldquo;there is one thing that I have thought about for a long time. It is Xiaohui&rsquo;s third spiritual eye&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before the words fell, suddenly a huge growl like a dog&rsquo;s bark broke out in the sky outside their house and qilidong. The sound moved everywhere, as if shaking the whole mountain range. Even the two of them, as practitioners, felt a buzz in their ears.</p>
<p>Both of them were surprised. They quickly walked to the door, opened the door and went out.</p>
<p>The huge sound reverberated in the qilidong Valley, and there were endless echoes from far and near. At the moment, all the Miao people in qilidong were shocked by the huge voice, and the original calm was suddenly broken.</p>
<p>GUI Li only saw that countless Miao people rushed out of the house one after another. Looking from afar, they all looked frightened. Many people kept shouting the same sentence, but he couldn&rsquo;t understand what it meant.</p>
<p>After that, Xiaobai also stepped out and stood beside him. Looking at the confused Miao people in the distance, he gradually frowned and said in a low voice, &ldquo;maybe something has happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li also saw that things were wrong and said, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter? What are those Miao people talking about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Bai, with a dignified face, said: &ldquo;the loud voice just now is an alarm from the stone carving of the dog god worshipped by the Miao people. If it was not for the time when there was a dying race, the dog God would never have made such a sound. As far as I know, for thousands of years, the dog God of Miao people has only issued a warning</p>
<p>GUI Li&rsquo;s heart was agitated. At the moment, the hope of Biyao&rsquo;s life and death was placed on the mysterious wizard in the Miao people&rsquo;s altar. However, this strange thing happened at the moment. Just as he wanted to say something and asked Xiaobai clearly, great changes began to appear in the originally quiet night sky of qilidong.</p>
<p>Originally twinkling stars in the night sky, suddenly began to gather a thick dark cloud, will cover up the stars one by one. The layers of dark clouds swarmed from all directions, changeable and extremely weird.</p>
<p>Standing on the ground, the tiny people could not help but cry out of fear. Countless people began to run around, and then more people began to kneel down to the mountain where the Miao people&rsquo;s altar was located.</p>
<p>Under the dark clouds, this originally full of joy of the land a sad.</p>
<p>GUI Li frowned and said in a low voice, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s someone who practices Taoism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaobai was beside him, looking at the sky and saying, &ldquo;where&rsquo;s the man, do you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li slowly shook his head and said: &ldquo;from the perspective of the manipulation of the wind and cloud, it is very strange. It is not like the Middle Earth orthodox way, and it is also quite different from the demon sect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little white mouth moved. There was a strange look on his face. He seemed to think of something, but somehow, he didn&rsquo;t say it.</p>
<p>Now, with the dark clouds getting lower and lower. It seems that the Miao people in qilidong are more and more difficult to breathe. Everyone is shocked, and the image of chaos is more obvious. At this chaotic moment, a figure suddenly appears among the Miao people and looks far away. It is Tu Magu, the leader of the Miao people.</p>
<p>Tu Ma Gu yelled at the Miao people and waved their arms vigorously. Gradually, the Miao people calmed down a little. Under the command of tumagu, women, girls and children began to run to a mountain in the distance, leaving behind young men, most of whom were armed with weapons. Obviously, Miao people knew that things were critical and were ready to fight to the death.</p>
<p>In the chaos, Tu Ma Gu takes a look at the bank. Hell, Li and Li are standing outside the door. They are stunned for a moment. Then they nod their heads and turn their attention to the commanding clansman.</p>
<p>Black clouds gradually low, according to the small white face also cloudy and sunny. All of a sudden, she whispered to the ghost: &ldquo;with this enigmatic monk, I&rsquo;m afraid the Miao people are not rivals. Do you want to help them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li was silent for a moment, nodded and said, &ldquo;since Biyao depends on them&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not finished. Suddenly, there was a strange noise in the dark clouds in the sky, such as thunder, roar of beasts, and in a moment, the black clouds were like being burned. There was a great deal of light. Inside and outside the clouds, there was hot gold.</p>
<p>A moment later, in the roar of the deep clouds, a huge ball of fire fell from the sky, with a flaming flame, but in the center. But it seems to be burning a strange black flame. Before reaching the ground, all the trees around were scorched. The Miao people were astonished and exclaimed in all directions. However, the momentum of the Fireball&rsquo;s downward attack was so rapid that it did not wait for the Miao people to run away. They heard the sound of breaking the sky and rushing to the ground.</p>
<p>In the loud noise, countless broken arms and limbs flew out with the burning flame, which was terrible and howled everywhere.</p>
<p>GUI Li&rsquo;s face changed. Unexpectedly, the man in the dark cloud said that he would do it. He was about to get up and fly to help the Miao people. However, he felt that his back was suddenly tight, but Xiaobai held him.</p>
<p>Ghost Li heart strange, to her to see, small white to the distance a glance, way: &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t worry, look there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ghost Li followed her eyes and saw that Xiaobai was looking at the Miao people&rsquo;s altar on the hillside. On the platform of the hill, where the flame was blazing, a thin and bent figure stood erect and looked up to the sky. Although the figure of the first wizard was not very clear, it was not very clear from the figure of the wizard.</p>
<p>He stopped and gazed at the old figure in the mountain.</p>
<p>The flame clouds in the sky are burning more and more prosperous, and the whole night sky is dyed red, such as the image of the last world. Heaven and earth are all destroyed. In this border area of Southern Xinjiang, it is in full swing.</p>
<p>There was a roar and a blazing night wind. Suddenly, there was a cry of surprise. Behind the soldiers of the Miao people, there was a loud cry of death.</p>
<p>All the Miao people lost their color, and Tu Ma Gu&rsquo;s face changed greatly. Qilidong is easy to defend and difficult to attack. There is only one mountain road leading to the outside of the mountain. The Miao people have always been heavily garrisoned. At this moment, someone is attacking them unconsciously, isn&rsquo;t it</p>
<p>Is this really the day for the Miao people to die?</p>
<p>However, after 200 years of domination by the Miao Nationality in southern Xinjiang, Tu Magu, as the clan leader, was still able to calm down and shout. He rushed behind him first, and a moment later, the Miao soldiers followed.</p>
<p>The night is like blood. The cold light of countless weapons lights up one after another in an instant, crossing the sky and splashing with bright red blood.</p>
<p>Flames burning, heaven and earth to split, that group of soldiers like the devil, chest tattoo bear head, galloping, crazy out of the dark. His eyes were full of fanaticism and bloodthirsty. He was the first one. He was very tall and his naked upper body was scarred. He was holding a huge stone axe and fighting vertically and horizontally. Everywhere he passed, he was bleeding and crying.</p>
<p>Miao soldiers are known for their bravery, but one thing happened suddenly tonight, and the dog God barked at the sky, which was the omen of a once-in-a-thousand-year disaster, and the people of Miao were in turmoil and panic. Secondly, the Li people ambushed for a long time and suddenly killed them. In addition, they forged their bravery in the bitter land of Southern Xinjiang for 200 years, and the situation that they would die if they failed Unable to resist, they retreated.</p>
<p>Tu Ma Gu&rsquo;s eyes were like fire. At the moment, he had seen the enemy&rsquo;s appearance and roared: &ldquo;Li nationality!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The leader of the Li clan raised his axe and cut down another Miao soldier. He grinned and said, &ldquo;Miao dogs, I&rsquo;ll ask you to repay all of your 200 year old feud today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only when the voice goes down. As if against his words, Li&rsquo;s countless soldiers roared in unison, like wild animals barking at the moon, with endless madness. One after another, the Miao people could not resist it, and they were about to collapse.</p>
<p>At this critical moment, suddenly in the valley, a deep and mysterious voice sounded. Such as whispers, such as the nether world, reverberates around every inch of qilidong.</p>
<p>The soldiers of the Miao people were very happy and shocked. Looking at the Li nationality, from the head of the clan, they were all frightened.</p>
<p>The great wizard who was famous and awed in southern Xinjiang finally appeared at the most critical moment of Miao nationality.</p>
<p>The red light flickered in the burning flames all over the sky, and then rapidly increased. With the great wizard standing on the mountain platform as the center, it spread to the whole qilidong. Where they passed, the burning flames were extinguished.</p>
<p>A moment later, the red light has already extended to the battle field between the Miao people and the Li people. From behind, the Miao people are safe and sound under the red light. But at the end of the red light, a strong soldier of the Li nationality touches the mysterious red light, and suddenly gives a scream and falls on the ground convulsing. After a moment, the whole body trembled and the seven orifices bled to death.</p>
<p>Most of the Li people were shocked and retreated one after another. These soldiers were used to fighting. In front of them, any powerful enemy and giant beast will not even blink their eyes. However, such mysterious witchcraft has always been the most frightening power of the southern Xinjiang people. For a moment, everyone looked frightened.</p>
<p>The head of the Li clan also had a panic on his face. The name of the great wizard of the Miao people is a devil like existence to the other four ethnic groups in southern Xinjiang. At this moment, he deeply realizes this point.</p>
<p>But instead of ordering a retreat, he looked up at the sky.</p>
<p>That piece of flame burning in the night sky, blazing and surging!</p>
<p>There was laughter, which came out with contempt and hostility.</p>
<p>The clouds all over the sky were bright in an instant, and the burning flame seemed to be suddenly transparent and blazing, and turned into a terrible beast in the middle of the sky. The wind helps the fire, the fire rises higher, and the wind and cloud change constantly, like the roaring sea.</p>
<p>In front of the clouds, someone appeared, like a god man, with flames all over his body. Looking down from the air, he looked down like a proud God.</p>
<p>He waved his arms in mid air and made a series of strange actions. A moment later, if there was a mysterious force behind him, the sky was suddenly filled with flames, clouds were flowing wildly, and only a huge explosion was heard. In an instant, countless fireballs fell from the sky and rushed down into the world with a raging flame.</p>
<p>All the people on the ground, including GUI Li and Xiao Bai, all changed their faces. Just now, only one fireball fell, which was so powerful. Once the countless fireballs fell, qilidong would turn into a sea of fire and could no longer be kept.</p>
<p>Ordinary people can see it, and the great wizard naturally knows this. The red light in the valley almost lights up at the same time. Looking from afar, although he still can&rsquo;t see his face clearly, the thin figure looks very old under the powerful fire.</p>
<p>At the moment, people looked carefully, and it turned out that the red light came from the great wizard standing on the mountain platform. To be exact, it was from a wooden stick in his hand.</p>
<p>The stick was dark in color and even taller than the whole wizard. Especially on the top of the stick, there was a strange stone not made of gold or jade. Under the urging of the great wizard&rsquo;s mysterious sorcerer, it gave out more and more intense red light.</p>
<p>The people of the Li nationality suddenly became agitated, and countless soldiers turned red in the twinkling of an eye. The leader of the Li clan, the giant, roared with a roar, as if with two hundred years of deep hatred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bone jade!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked up at the sky and cried out: &ldquo;the great bear God ah ah ah ah ah ah&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The voice was shrill and ferocious, moving in all directions. In a moment, all the soldiers of Li nationality roared together and rushed forward one after another. The moment of blood splashing was just the edge of life and death.</p>
<p>Night is burning, people are crazy!</p>
<p>Miao soldiers fight to death, but in the face of crazy Li soldiers, they gradually lost the courage to fight, and gradually retreated.</p>
<p>The river in qilidong is gradually red, reflecting the countless fireballs flying down in the sky!</p>
<p>The red light surged up to the sky, facing those huge fireballs, forming a bloody barrier, covering the qilidong sky.</p>
<p>Countless hot balls of fire almost hit the red curtain at the same time, and the huge explosion echoed among the mountains, blowing up a huge red flame.</p>
<p>The great wizard raised his hands over the top, and the tall wooden stick pointed straight to the sky, fighting the mysterious figure in the sky with all his strength. It&rsquo;s just that as time goes by, the pressure from the sky is getting bigger and bigger, and it&rsquo;s almost inhuman.</p>
<p>The great wizard was shocked. There had never been such magic and strange methods among the Li people for thousands of years. Otherwise, they would have used them in the decisive battle to determine the fate of the two clans 200 years ago.</p>
<p>However, in front of him, the mysterious figure in the sky seems like an invincible God of war</p>
<p>Deep in the heart of the great wizard, there is a growing haze. This strange magic is not owned by the world at all, but the legend of the mysterious devil that has been secretly circulated in southern Xinjiang for thousands of years</p>
<p>In the sky, the flame is blazing. Standing on the cloud top of the ah Tai, the excited face reflected by the surrounding flames can no longer hide his pride. Deeply shocked by the tribesmen&rsquo;s disaster since childhood, he abandoned everything and went deep into the mountains of 100000. He found the devil and begged for his endless and powerful power. Today, he is finally able to rescue the people from the abyss of suffering.</p>
<p>The first step of the Li people&rsquo;s good life is to trample all the Miao people and take back the bone jade inlaid on the black stick of Miao people&rsquo;s sacred utensil to sacrifice to the great bear God. No, what is the bear God? Where is the bear God when the Li people suffer?</p>
<p>Ahetai roared in his heart and urged his magic power. In a moment, more than a dozen huge fireballs rushed down from the clouds. When he watched with pleasure the impact of the fireball and the red curtain made the once invincible figure tremble again and again, he had already decided that after winning the Li nationality, he would let all the people believe in the God, and only he could give it to Li Family brings new life!</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Note: Li nationality is a branch of Baiyue in ancient times. Before Qin and Han Dynasties, a branch of Luoyue crossed the sea from the mainland to Hainan Island. In the Sui Dynasty, Hainan Island residents were called &ldquo;lilao&rdquo;, the ancestors of Li nationality. Today, they mainly live in the Li and Miao Autonomous Prefecture in central and southern Hainan Province, and the rest live in Wanning, Tunchang, Qionghai, Chengmai, Lu County, Ding&rsquo;an and other counties. Li is their pronunciation transformation of &ldquo;mountain&rdquo;. (to be continued. )</p>
