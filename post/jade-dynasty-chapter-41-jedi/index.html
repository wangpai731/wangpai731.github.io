      <p>The waves of the merciless sea gradually subsided, but the fear in the hearts of the people did not abate at all. The huge body of the black water black snake is coiled in front of the eyes, standing there like a demon from ancient times.</p>
<p>It seems that the snake head of this behemoth is slightly swinging. I didn&rsquo;t expect to encounter the breath of living people in the lifeless abyss. I looked at all the people for a few more times, but there was no movement for a while.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi is calm. First of all, she turns to see Zhang Xiaofan still looking up at the black water black snake, and gently pulls his sleeve. When Zhang Xiaofan turned around, Lu Xueqi said softly, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s step back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan immediately woke up, nodded and helped Lu Xueqi back. Standing at the back of Biyao&rsquo;s side, the masked woman saw the corner of her eyes and lost her voice: &ldquo;don&rsquo;t move.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan and Lu Xueqi were stunned, but in a twinkling of an eye, the green light in the black water black snake&rsquo;s huge eyes burst up, which seemed to be startled by something, making a huge roar. All the people on the scene covered their ears, but they still felt the buzz in their ears.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was shocked. Suddenly, he saw the body of the black water snake move. The snake&rsquo;s tail, which was soaked in the sea water, swept away. Suddenly, a row of water walls, which were several Zhangs high and tens of Zhangs wide, spread all over the place. Among the water flowers, there were black snake&rsquo;s tail mixed with it, rushing with boundless energy.</p>
<p>The water is still a few meters away, and the strong wind is coming. It&rsquo;s hard to stand. If you&rsquo;re hit by the tsunami like water wall, you&rsquo;ll have to break your bones if you come across the huge snake tail. Zhang Xiaofan doesn&rsquo;t care about so many things. He holds Lu Xueqi in his right hand and flies back with all his strength.</p>
<p>But the water wall was like the wind, faster than any action. Zhang Xiaofan was caught up by the water wall before he flew out. The sound of the water was thundering, almost in my ear. Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s whole body is tense, and there is almost no thought in his mind. At the moment of life and death, Zhang Xiaofan shouts. He flew up with all his strength, but only a foot away from the ground. Zhang Xiaofan felt cold all over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boom&rdquo;!</p>
<p>He was involuntarily involved in the huge waves, and his whole body was soaked in a flash. More listen to beside Lu Xueqi silent exclamation, in the hands of a pine, in this force can not be when, he and Lu Xueqi were hit by the living scattered.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan loses his color and is struggling to hold Lu Xueqi. But how powerful the waves are, only in an instant the two have separated by a few feet.</p>
<p>Seeing the huge waves surging, Lu Xueqi, who was still around, disappeared into the turbulent darkness in a flash. Zhang Xiaofan was shaking all over, and his mind was in chaos. The whole person was pushed by the huge waves and rolled forward in the waves.</p>
<p>Just at this moment when Zhang Xiaofan felt that there was almost a crack in his whole body, which was squeezed by great force, he suddenly saw it in the waves. At the sound of the roar, the black shadow flashed, and the huge black snake tail of the black water Xuan snake rushed over like a mountain.</p>
<p>In the place where the black passed, the water burst into flames. In the middle of the room, I didn&rsquo;t know that the sand and stone of luou iliyejiao J were flying, and there was no match. Zhang Xiaofan was killed, and he didn&rsquo;t believe that he could survive the huge tail attack.</p>
<p>At this moment of life and death, Zhang Xiaofan rose up to be brave, and his body did not know where to pour out his strength. Among the waves, only the dark blue light rose again. Zhang Xiaofan is attached to it, flees for his life and rises up in the sky. He has rushed up a foot in this huge wave.</p>
<p>He was in the middle of a euphoria. Suddenly, he felt that a powerful force was sweeping under him, and his whole body quivered. Even though he was swept by this force, his eyes were already dark, and he wanted to faint. If he didn&rsquo;t know it was a real life and death moment. It&rsquo;s close to death to stay awake.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true, but the power of the black water Xuan snake&rsquo;s tail sweeping is so powerful that Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s whole body is shocked and his bones are breaking. Almost the whole person will be split. In this huge wave, there is no more power. He is hit by this power and flies away.</p>
<p>Others in the air, involuntarily flying straight to the boundless darkness ahead. Turning over, I looked down and saw that the huge waves like mountains and the huge snake tail had engulfed those people of Biyao in a twinkling of an eye. The people in yellow flew apart, but they were immediately hit by the waves.</p>
<p>The woman in green jumped up and made a gesture with her hands, but when she saw the white light rise, the white flower in her hand was sacrificed in front of her body. In a moment, six strange flowers appeared, surrounded by the flower in the middle. Each flower has a pure white light connecting with it, which looks like a white light wheel.</p>
<p>Then I saw that Baguio was pale, but he didn&rsquo;t seem to be flustered. As soon as the white light came into being, it suddenly turned up. The dazzling white light was facing the huge waves. It was Sheng Sheng who blocked the huge waves. In the middle of the air for a moment, the huge waves piled up like a mountain, almost terrifying.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of this moment to breathe, Biyao flew up, but at this time, I saw the noise in the huge waves suddenly Sheng Sheng, rumble do sound, the huge black snake tail was at this time, swept to.</p>
<p>In a moment, the white light wheel disappeared, but it couldn&rsquo;t hold back a minute and a half. Seeing that the girl in this pattern was about to be hit by this huge tail, suddenly in the spray, the masked woman suddenly appeared, the soft pale yellow circle in her hand flashed in the air, and came quickly. Before taking advantage of the big tail of UB, she held a support under the body of Biyao.</p>
<p>This was the danger for Biyao to avoid the life-threatening thing, but she was still swept by the rest of her strength. When she was light, she drifted out to the dark place behind her. At the next moment, the figure of the masked woman is again submerged in the waves.</p>
<p>The power of sweeping the tail of black water snake is unimaginable. Zhang Xiaofan was in the middle of the sky, but he felt that the wind was blowing in his ear, and the whole man was flying backwards.</p>
<p>If it suddenly bumps into something, such as a hard rock cliff, all the bones of the whole body may not be broken. But knowing that Zhang Xiaofan has no control over himself, the whole body can&rsquo;t help but let it go.</p>
<p>Who knows that the abyss of the dead spirit is really huge. After flying for a long time, it has not met anything. Even Zhang Xiaofan felt that the speed was slowing down gradually, and he was falling slowly. It seemed that the rest of his strength was fading.</p>
<p>Although it&rsquo;s hard to fall to the ground, it&rsquo;s better to be disheartened than to bump into the wall. Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s heart is in a happy place. All of a sudden, he feels that the darkness in front of him suddenly solidifies like a mountain and presses his head.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a mountain and a precipice, standing in front of it. Zhang Xiaofan hunched his head and hit it hard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bang!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rubble flying, Venus flying, Zhang Xiaofan body shock. Wow, then spray a mouthful of blood, sprinkle on the lapel. Only in this moment, he felt that his whole body was scattered. If there were not two Dharma protectors in his body. I had to die.</p>
<p>However, he did not feel well. After a pause on the cliff, the whole man was unable to slide down, and his body was sliding down. Several times, he bumped into the hard stone wall. In the &ldquo;bang&rdquo; sound, his whole body was in sharp pain, and he didn&rsquo;t know how many bones were broken. Anyway, he only felt that there was no complete place in his whole body.</p>
<p>After falling like this for a while, after another collision, Zhang Xiaofan turned out. At this moment, he almost gave up hope, but between the turns, there was a faint light from the burning stick in front of his chest.</p>
<p>There was a dark shadow not far below, like an old tree growing on the cliff.</p>
<p>In this critical moment, he didn&rsquo;t expect that there would be trees growing on the hard stone wall of the dead soul pit. Instinctively, he stretched out his hand and grabbed the old tree.</p>
<p>The wind was rapid, and he fell faster, but he finally caught the old tree at the time of the lightning and flint.</p>
<p>Between the tentacles, as expected, there is no coldness of the cliff stone. It&rsquo;s a little warm, but it&rsquo;s a huge fall. The old tree seems to be unstable. Zhang Xiaofan grabs the trunk. But the tree body shakes violently, and the earth and stone fall. It shakes a few times. In the roar, the tree and people fall down together.</p>
<p>At the moment of falling, Zhang Xiaofan only felt his heart sank. A heart, like a bottomless abyss, is still falling down in a panic, but after this resistance, the speed is still slower, only to hear a loud sound, fell heavily on the ground, and then fainted.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how long it took for Zhang Xiaofan to wake up slowly. Before he opened his eyes, he felt a sharp pain all over his body, like a broken frame. However, with the pain, it seems that there is still life, but my heart is not all sad.</p>
<p>He opened his eyes and went into them, but he couldn&rsquo;t help but be stunned.</p>
<p>At the moment, as like as two peas in a cave, the two people came to the high cave top. They were only three feet wide, very narrow, and the cold edges and hard edges of the stone were just the same as those on the cliffs just now.</p>
<p>However, there seems to be something shining in the stone in the cave. It&rsquo;s not very big but a lot. One by one, it emits soft light, which makes the cave very bright.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan carefully looked at the situation in the cave, and thought that it seemed to be on a corridor, one end of which was a pile of rubble, which blocked the road tightly, the other end extended inward, but turned a corner not far away, unable to see the situation inside.</p>
<p>He was stunned on the ground for a while, then he wanted to get up. Unexpectedly, he moved. His left hand supported him on the ground. Suddenly, his whole body ached and he cried out. &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; The body trembled for a while, especially the pain in the left hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A cold hum suddenly came from the deep part of the cave. Zhang Xiaofan was shocked and turned to look at it. However, he saw a woman turning around the corner. She was in green clothes and beautiful appearance. Who was that evil cult fairy?</p>
<p>The two of them were still in a confrontation just now. When Zhang Xiaofan suddenly saw the people in the demon sect, he instinctively raised the fire stick and kept alert. For a while, he forgot the pain on his body.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the young girl named Baguio stared at him. She didn&rsquo;t mean to do anything at all. She looked strange and lost. It seemed that the whole person couldn&rsquo;t get up. She was impatient and said: &ldquo;OK, OK, look at your silly appearance. You&rsquo;ve broken seven or eight bones. You&rsquo;re still so energetic!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan frowned, but when he saw Baguio, he didn&rsquo;t seem to have the intention to start. Although it was strange, he slowly put down the fire stick. Unexpectedly, as soon as he relaxed, the pain began to diffuse, and he could not help shouting again.</p>
<p>Looking at the strange face of the righteous young man, Biyao couldn&rsquo;t help but smile, and the atmosphere eased down. But after the laughter, she sighed again with sadness.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan snorted. He was obstinate and was laughed by the young woman. He was greatly ashamed and said angrily, &ldquo;what is milk laughing at?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biyao looked at him and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m laughing at you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan heard that she was so direct that he didn&rsquo;t save face at all. He was more angry and said angrily, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s funny? Have a look at the milk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as Biyao&rsquo;s face changed, she seemed to be going to teach the boy a lesson. Unexpectedly, her hand moved, but suddenly it meant nothing. She sighed, &ldquo;we are all dead soon. What else can I fight with you for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan is on alert. Suddenly, hearing this woman say such things, I couldn&rsquo;t help being shocked and said, &ldquo;what does milk say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>After looking at him, Biyao said, &ldquo;this is a cave. Can&rsquo;t you see that? &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan said, &ldquo;yes! So what? &quot;</p>
<p>Biyao snorted, pointed to the stone in front of her, and said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the only exit. Now it&rsquo;s under the pressure of mountain like stones. If you have the ability, you can open the mountain and break your belly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan opens his mouth wide.</p>
<p>He took a look at the disordered stone and saw that the entrance of the cave was tightly blocked by the huge stone without any gap. He knew his own business. If he was against the enemy, his fire stick and his Taoism were still useful. But if it was used to dig mountains and fields like a fool, it was really not the best thing.</p>
<p>After a while, he suddenly thought of something important. I quickly turned around and said, &ldquo;I remember that I hit the cliff and fell to the ground. Why did I come to this cave?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dragged you in,&rdquo; said Biyao faintly</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Zhang Xiaofan is very angry.</p>
<p>Biyao glanced at him and said, &ldquo;I fell not far away from your coma. I saw you. Now the black water snake chased us again. I looked up and saw that the old tree you pulled was actually a cave. There was still light in it, and the cave was not big. Then he hid in. Before I leave, I see you are pitiful, and then I pull you in, fool! &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan frowned and said, &ldquo;why is this cave buried?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Baguio shrugged. With a sad look on his face, he said: &ldquo;the black water Xuan snake can&rsquo;t come in. In a rage, he swept the tail of the snake and hit the cliff. As a result, he collapsed half of the mountain and brought it here. Bury us all alive. &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan looked at her for a long time and said, &ldquo;really?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The anger on Bagao&rsquo;s face appeared, and she grabbed a big stone and threw it, &ldquo;I lied to you? It&rsquo;s best to know you&rsquo;re dead! &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan couldn&rsquo;t dodge, so he had to protect his head with his hand. Unexpectedly, the stone was hitting his left hand, and he felt pain when he boarded it. He almost fainted again when it was dark.</p>
<p>When Bagao saw Zhang Xiaofan in the distance, her face suddenly turned white. She took the left hand that was thrown by the stone and made a painful color. Her heart leaped. Then she said coldly, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t pretend to be dead. I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of people like you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan still has the strength to deal with what she said &ldquo;pretending to die&rdquo; at the moment, but he feels that he is really going to die of pain, and his whole hand is so painful that he loses consciousness.</p>
<p>After watching for a while, Biyao saw that he didn&rsquo;t seem to pretend. She stepped up to Zhang Xiaofan and looked at him. She ignored Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s face. She reached out and pinched Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan burst into a cold sweat and said angrily, &ldquo;what does milk do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But she was not angry. She apologized and said, &ldquo;your hand bone is broken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan snorted, but he was stubborn and said, &ldquo;this is what I broke by the black water snake. It has nothing to do with milk.</p>
<p>Milk, go away</p>
<p>Baguio looked at him a little more and said nothing. He walked away, stood aside and looked coldly. It was like watching a good play.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was in great pain, but he could not lose his face in front of the fairy at the moment. At that time, he stood up strongly and checked himself. But he saw that there were many bruises around him, but most of them were injuries. Only his left hand was broken, which was a great fortune.</p>
<p>But even so, the pain of the broken bone was not tolerable. He moved like this for several times, involving the injury, and cold sweat came out again.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan clenched his teeth and tried to fix his arm according to the general healing skill he learned from the bamboo peak of Qingyun Mountain. Unexpectedly, he searched everywhere, but all of them were strange stones with abrupt shapes. There was no straight wooden bar to fix his arm, which made him worried.</p>
<p>At this time, Biyao stood aside and suddenly said, &ldquo;your stick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was stunned, and then woke up. The fire staff was a foot long and was just used. At the moment, he looked at the young girl and said thank you, but he saw her look down on her face. He swallowed his words to his mouth and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve thought of it for a long time. I need more milk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a sip of her mouth, she said, &ldquo;what are you looking for</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan said angrily, &ldquo;can&rsquo;t I see the way out? Are you really stuck here all your life if you don&rsquo;t find a way out? &quot; Speaking of this, he suddenly remembered something. When he was shocked, he turned his head and said to Biyao, &ldquo;by the way, can you see my elder martial sister?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seeing his anxious appearance, Biyao was stunned for a moment, then shook his head and said, &ldquo;at that time, everyone was at the critical moment of life, how could anyone pay attention to others?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was silent and worried. Lu Xueqi had been poisoned before. He was in such a big trouble again. He was afraid of his life. He sighed at the thought. Head down.</p>
<p>Biyao&rsquo;s face slowed down. Seeing the young man bow his head and fix his injured arm on the ugly fire stick, he couldn&rsquo;t help asking, &ldquo;are you and your elder martial sister very well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was shocked and shook his head and said, &ldquo;no, but she is me after all. Why should I tell milk?&rdquo; Hum. Zhang Xiaofan suddenly woke up and stopped paying attention to her. She tore off her clothes, tied her left hand firmly with her mouth and right hand, and looked at a lot of stones at the door. Finally, she sighed and turned to walk into the hole.</p>
<p>Watching Zhang Xiaofan go in, Biyao couldn&rsquo;t help saying, &ldquo;where are you going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Zhang Xiaofan walked along, he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been buried here alive. Let&rsquo;s see what&rsquo;s going on inside!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biyao snorted, but somehow, in the dead cave. She still followed up, as if two people together, there is no such panic.</p>
<p>Turning around the corner, Zhang Xiaofan was presented with a corridor similar to the one he had just been in. However, it was more spacious, and the stone walls on both sides were still shining. The light here was quite bright, but the dust under his feet was very thick, so there were obvious footprints when he stepped on it.</p>
<p>There is a footprints in the middle of the road. It seems that Biyao left it when she came in to investigate.</p>
<p>I walked for a while. At the end of the corridor, there was another corner in front of it, and there was a faint sound of water.</p>
<p>At this time, the Biyao walking behind him suddenly called out, &ldquo;Zhang Xiaofan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Zhang Xiaofan subconsciously replied, but immediately turned back. &ldquo;How does milk know my name?&rdquo; he said</p>
<p>With a chuckle, Bagao said, &ldquo;you told me in the city of Heyang!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan then remembered that he was so embarrassed that he turned his head and walked forward. At the same time, he said, &ldquo;how can there be a sound of water in front?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biyao said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s at the end of the passage. There&rsquo;s a curtain of water. Besides, there is no way out. Alas! I didn&rsquo;t expect to die in this place. &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan ignored her and walked forward. After a while, the sound of the water grew louder and louder. After a while, I saw the end of the passage in front of me. I hung a curtain of water directly from the top of the cave. The water splashed and glistening. At last, it fell into a small pool at the end of the passage. If it wasn&rsquo;t in the Jedi, it would be a scenery.</p>
<p>But now no matter who it is, there will be no good mood to enjoy the scenery. Zhang Xiaofan went to the waterfall and looked at it carefully. Then his heart cooled.</p>
<p>Behind the waterfall is the hard stone wall, which is no different from the stones on both sides of the passage. The small pool is more clear and can see the bottom, and where the water flows out. A small place can only penetrate into the ground. On the top, the dripping place is just on the top of a stone wall cave. I don&rsquo;t know if loug is full of water and drips continuously. Where is the way out?</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan looks back and meets the eyes of Biyao. They both look at each other and are silent.</p>
<p>For a while, the cave fell into a dead silence.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan felt confused and worried about Lu Xueqi, who was in a desperate situation. He was upset and didn&rsquo;t say whether the wound on his left hand could be handled well or not. The pain came again and again, which was extremely painful.</p>
<p>Biyao looked at his appearance, and somehow she felt a bit impatient. She said in a low voice, &ldquo;sit down and have a rest! Let&rsquo;s think of a way to get out. &quot;</p>
<p>Among the Jedi, Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s original hostility to her seemed to fade. If he was in the outside world, he would be irreconcilable with the Witch of the demon sect. But at this time and here, both of them would die here together. Where can we pay attention to the opinion of any sect?</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan sat down in silence and looked around. At last, he looked at the stone wall on the dripping ground. He thought to himself, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect that I had suffered so many setbacks when I first went down the mountain. Now I&rsquo;m even dead. If master knew, I&rsquo;m afraid that I would scold the unworthy disciples again!&rdquo;! If elder martial sister ling&rsquo;er knew it, she did not know that from her side, Biyao could not help but say, &ldquo;what are you thinking?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan woke up with a red face, but how could he tell the truth? He looked at the dead soul pit and said, &ldquo;there are so many strange things in the pit. Looking at the red places on the top of the cave, the water drops flow through them. They are all reflected like blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biyao suddenly jumped up, eyes wide, look nervous, urgent way: &ldquo;what do you say?&rdquo; (to be continued. )</p>
