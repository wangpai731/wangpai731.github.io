      <p>In the early morning, when the sky was just bright, the sky around Qingyun Mountain was covered with dark clouds, and rain drops soon fell. The rain increased from a small age, and soon became gray between the sky and the earth. The sound of rain was everywhere, enveloping the towering mountains in a water mist, which was hazy and mysterious.</p>
<p>The sound of rain beating green bamboo leaves seems to have not changed for thousands of years, and it always seems lonely on Qingyun Mountain. From the top of the roof, which is covered with moss because of its long age, the water drops have changed into water curtains from tick to tick, falling like pearls one after another, falling on the ground made of bluestone, splashing water particles like pearls.</p>
<p>There is wind in the rain, blowing in the rain flowers, with a touch of moisture and rain powder, wandering between the windowsill, seems to also miss something.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi looked out of the window in front of the independent window, the rain and mountain scenery were endless. In such a cold time, it seemed that only the sound of rain beating bamboo leaves in the distance reverberated between the landscape of heaven and earth.</p>
<p>The dark hair on her temples fluttered gently in the breeze, and the feeling of the rain powder brushing her face was like a burst of cold into the skin. She gently pursed her lips and supported the window sill. The sound of the rain seemed to be far and near, but it seemed to fall into her deep heart at last.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if there are any ripples?</p>
<p>The sound of footsteps rings outside the house. Someone knocks on the door. Lu Xueqi looks back in silence, quietly wakes up from the misty misty rain, and goes to open the door. Outside is the elder martial sister Wen min.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s mouth corner light smile, way: &ldquo;elder martial sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wen Min looks at her slightly emaciated face, frowns and walks in. Lu Xueqi closes the door immediately and the two sit down in the simple room. Wen Min first looked at the bed, but saw that the bedding on the bed was neat, sighed and said, &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t you sleep last night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi said quietly, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wen Min looks at Lu Xueqi and feels tingling in her heart. She enters xiaozhufeng gate earlier than Lu Xueqi. Lu Xueqi has always been a good friend. With Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s lofty and aloof character, in addition to her mentor Shui Yue, Wen Min is the only one who is best with her on weekdays. I can say a few words. Recently, Lu Xueqi has been in constant trouble. Wen Min is also worried. Although she is worried, she still has nothing to do. She has to watch Lu Xueqi and her master and the elders of Qingyun gate getting more and more difficult.</p>
<p>There was a moment of silence in the room.</p>
<p>Wen Min didn&rsquo;t know what to say, but after a while, Lu Xueqi said softly: &ldquo;elder martial sister, this time for my sake, I really can&rsquo;t help you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wen Min was stunned and said, &ldquo;what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi said, &ldquo;I heard that martial uncle Tian and uncle Su Ru of dazhufeng personally brought elder martial brother song Daren to propose a marriage. However, the master refused in person and had a big fight with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wen Min gave a bitter smile. There was something bitter in his smile. He shook his head slowly and said, &ldquo;Alas Well. That&rsquo;s nothing. Besides, it&rsquo;s none of your business. It&rsquo;s all because he and I have no predestined relationship. Moreover, we all know that Shifu always hates people from dazhufeng. &quot;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi shook her head in silence and said, &ldquo;no, it was on that day that I contradicted my master and made her angry. Therefore, I also implicated you. Otherwise, uncle Su Ru was on the side. Uncle Tian is willing to give such a big face and personally propose marriage. Most of your things can be done. But I&rsquo;m sorry, elder martial sister! &quot;</p>
<p>Wen Min smiles and breathes a sigh. He said, &ldquo;well, don&rsquo;t blame yourself here. I&rsquo;m not very good. Moreover, master is only angry for a while, and he may not have no chance in the future.&rdquo; Speaking of this, she took a look at Lu Xueqi. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk about me. It&rsquo;s you. What are you going to do? You can&rsquo;t keep fighting with master like this all the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s face turned white for a moment and she was silent.</p>
<p>Wen Min pondered for a long time and said, &ldquo;younger martial sister, I know a little about your mind, but it&rsquo;s no way for you to go on like this, Zhang That man, after all, has entered the magic Road, and is despised by the world&rsquo;s righteous way. Moreover, if you go to the southwest this time, in the fierce battle between the demon sect and the monster, you can see the scene there&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>Wen Min suddenly stops and stops talking, because Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s face seems to lose her blood color in an instant. Even her clear eyes seem to be engraved with deep pain.</p>
<p>There was silence in the middle of the room for a long time, and the rain outside the window was silent and silent.</p>
<p>Finally, Wen Min said in a low voice: &ldquo;he is afraid that he is no longer in the world. If you are so persistent, you will only suffer from yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi, pale and speechless, slowly stood up and went to the windowsill and looked out. The mountain was covered with rain and fog, misty and lingering. It was like a dream. Even the rain powder drops blowing with the wind at the moment seemed to have a trace of unreal feeling in the cold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know&hellip;&rdquo; This cold and beautiful woman, in the misty rain, gently said: &ldquo;he may have gone, and sometimes I think, in fact, for him, this is not a relief. I also know that there is nothing wrong with master scolding me. It&rsquo;s me who is wrong. I shouldn&rsquo;t be delusional. I shouldn&rsquo;t be Should not&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>Her voice suddenly choked. Wen Min stood up and tried to comfort her. Unexpectedly, Lu Xueqi suddenly turned around, and her white dress was floating around like a lonely cloud.</p>
<p>Her eyes seem to have water drops, crystal clear, with a trace of sadness never before, said: &ldquo;elder martial sister, I know, but I just can&rsquo;t put it down. Even though I have cut this love for thousands of times, I still can&rsquo;t escape. After I came back from Southwest China, I didn&rsquo;t know how many times I said to myself. He was dead, he was dead, everything was over. However, every night after I fell asleep, I dreamt of the miserable situation in the poisonous snake Valley, and I dreamed that he was possessed by an animal demon&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi suddenly stopped. Her expression was so excited that Wen Min was worried. However, Lu Xueqi soon calmed down. Only in her eyes did she still have that sad feeling: &ldquo;then, I woke up with a cold sweat, like being in an ice cellar!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at Wen Min in silence, then her expression gradually became fragile, as if her body began to tremble slightly, and said, &ldquo;elder martial sister, what&rsquo;s wrong with me, what&rsquo;s wrong with me?&rdquo; She suddenly threw herself in Wen Min&rsquo;s arms. Wen Min put her arm around her shoulder. She felt that her thin body was shaking slightly. Her low voice came from her ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elder martial sister, I can&rsquo;t stand it any more. I&rsquo;m really about to lose it&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wen Min is silent and hugs Lu Xueqi, who has never been so fragile. This once aloof and aloof woman, now seems to be the most miserable person in the world.</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>Silence covers everything again. Outside the window, the sound of rain is urgent, and there seems to be a low choking sound in the wind. Outside the hut, on the edge of the bamboo forest, master Shuiyue stands in silence. Holding an oil cloth blue umbrella in his hand, he was staring at the room in the wind and rain.</p>
<p>Then she slowly turned away and disappeared in the bamboo forest.</p>
<p>Between heaven and earth, the wind and rain are bleak. It&rsquo;s a sad time.</p>
<p>In Heyang City, it usually rains.</p>
<p>Zhou Yixian, Xiao Huan and the wild dog Taoist came out of another remote lane and joined the crowded street. After a few steps, they retreated to the side of the road. On the one hand, there were too many people to walk. On the other hand, they hid from the rain and discussed it.</p>
<p>This time, the three people have been divided into two groups. Xiaohuan insists that he wants to go back to the villa. However, the Taoist priest of wild dog gave his first support to him.</p>
<p>Xiaohuan is weak and weak, but she has a clever tongue. One person and two people argue. In addition, although the opinion of the Taoist priest of wild dog is different from her, she is often speechless when she stares at her. Therefore, most of the time, only one person is against it.</p>
<p>At the moment, the three people were standing by the roadside, and Zhouxian said in a low voice: &ldquo;you silly girl, what are you going to do in such a dangerous place? Do you want to go back to die?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A little ring mouth. &ldquo;Thank you for living so many years, grandfather, do you know that there is a thing called morality?&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Monday, the immortal angrily said, &ldquo;morality? Moral fart! What kind of morality do you talk about when you&rsquo;re dead? That ghost like guy is so fierce. Don&rsquo;t we go back and die? &quot;</p>
<p>The wild dog Taoist nodded and said, &ldquo;yes, it&rsquo;s not right to go back&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Huan&rsquo;s eyes are horizontal, white his one eye, wild dog Taoist heart a jump, can&rsquo;t say at once.</p>
<p>Xiaohuan looked back at Monday and said, &ldquo;grandfather. If it had not been for the rescue of us last night, we would have died long ago, and we would not have stood here arguing about morality and immorality.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it right to go back and have a look? &quot;</p>
<p>Zhou Yixian&rsquo;s face did not change. He said, &ldquo;it is because he saved us that we should cherish our lives. Otherwise, if we fall into the trap and fall into the tiger&rsquo;s mouth again, will we not fail to live up to the will of the devil?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan was stunned and couldn&rsquo;t think of anything to refute Monday immortal. When he saw this, he couldn&rsquo;t help feeling proud. He said with a smile, &ldquo;no more words?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Small ring angry way: &ldquo;you know that person&rsquo;s ghost gas is dense, enigmatic, don&rsquo;t you care about your Savior at all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Monday immortal was calm and said: &ldquo;don&rsquo;t worry, the ghost fierce fellow wants to have a good way and a magic weapon. In terms of ghost spirit, I&rsquo;m afraid he is more gloomy than that coffin. It&rsquo;s hard to die. What do you worry about?&rdquo; After a pause, he said, &ldquo;besides, you showed him a picture ten years ago. It was said at that time that this man was a&rdquo; chaotic devil &ldquo;in the world. Although there were many twists and turns, he was not short-lived and died. So what are you worried about&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, have you ever shown me a picture?&rdquo; Suddenly, a voice came out of his side. The three people were startled. They turned their heads and saw the ghost suddenly appeared beside them. In broad daylight, he seemed to flash out of the rain.</p>
<p>Although the rain has been quite heavy at the moment, there are too many people fleeing in Heyang city. Most of them are afraid of the coming beast demon and ignore the rain. In fact, in recent days, people in Heyang city who are out of control because of their emotional tension have been seen from time to time. Fortunately, the Qingyun disciples have maintained order in the city, and most of them have arrived to deal with it in a short time. However, people are worried and the city is immersed in an atmosphere of crazy edge all day long.</p>
<p>Xiaohuan and other three people were all stunned for a moment. Then Xiaohuan was overjoyed and couldn&rsquo;t help but whisper: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s you&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Monday fairy and wild dog Taoist priest both frowned at the same time. Monday immortal hummed and said the same thing: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s you&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li ignored the two men. First, he took a look at Xiaohuan. Seeing her young face, she had obvious real joy. She could not help but feel a little warm in her eyes. She nodded slightly and said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this time, lying on the shoulder of the ghost, because the rain has soaked the hair of the monkey, Xiao Hui also squeaked to Xiao Huan twice, grinning and smiling, and seemed very happy to see the little ring.</p>
<p>Xiaohuan beamed and said to Xiao Hui, &ldquo;you still remember me! Hehe</p>
<p>Said, she looked up at the ghost, hesitated for a while, way: &ldquo;last night you, you all right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He nodded and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ok.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan just put down his mind and looked at the ghost. Suddenly I don&rsquo;t know how, face a red, eyes immediately turn to small ash body, smile and open hands. &ldquo;Come on, come here and I&rsquo;ll hug you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Hui chuckled two times, and suddenly stepped on his feet, left his ghostly shoulder and jumped straight into Xiaohuan&rsquo;s arms. Xiao Huan chuckles. I just felt that the monkey was wet and wanted to take out a piece of cloth to wipe it. Unexpectedly, the monkey seemed to feel uncomfortable. At the moment, his whole body suddenly shook and the water droplets splashed everywhere. Xiao Huan exclaimed, but he didn&rsquo;t want to leave the monkey behind. He had to close his eyes. After a while, the monkey made a lot of water on his face and body.</p>
<p>Xiaohuan opened his eyes and glared at Xiaohui. The monkey&rsquo;s three eyes blinked and blinked. Still. Xiaohuan snorted, threw both hands, and threw Xiaohui back to Gui Li&rsquo;s body. Xiao Hui climbed to the ghost&rsquo;s shoulder with two feet and three feet. Seeing Xiao Huan&rsquo;s busy tidying up his clothes, he couldn&rsquo;t help laughing.</p>
<p>Xiao Huan couldn&rsquo;t laugh or cry. She bit her lower lip and secretly looked at GUI Li. Then she lowered her head and straightened her clothes. GUI Li turned to Zhou Yixian and looked at Zhou Yixian. She felt a little weak in his heart. &ldquo;Hello, stinky boy, I was your Savior at the beginning. You can&rsquo;t mess around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A moment&rsquo;s silence. Looking around, I saw that the people nearby were all self-care. No one noticed here, so he asked the fairy on Monday, &ldquo;who are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Monday, the immortal looked up and said, &ldquo;I am an expert.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next to the small ring and wild dog Taoist body is a shake, obviously this answer makes people feel very strange.</p>
<p>However, GUI Li obviously ignored this &ldquo;expert&rdquo;. &ldquo;Last night, you lost your skill of earth hiding for a long time, but it is said that this kind of Taoist skill was the skill of Qingyun sect founder qingyunzi when he was wandering in the world. How can you have it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at Zhouxian deeply and said, &ldquo;what do you have to do with Qingyun gate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a moment of silence, Monday fairy said, &ldquo;OK! So far, I will not hide it from you&hellip; &quot; Xiao Huan and Taoist wild dog are both stunned. Seeing that the immortal looks serious on Monday, they can&rsquo;t help but be serious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is what happened when I was young. When I was young, I was handsome, elegant, talented and intelligent Well, don&rsquo;t look at me like that. I&rsquo;ll just go on. When I was young, I used to collect herbs for a living. Once I went into a deep mountain to collect herbs and accidentally fell into a cliff&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>GUI Li, Xiao Huan and Taoist wild dog frowned at the same time, but Monday immortal seemed to be talking and gradually became happy. He continued: &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m so lucky that I was caught by a pine tree in the air, which blocked most of the fall, and then fell down again. Unexpectedly, there was a pool under the cliff, so I was lucky not to die&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan couldn&rsquo;t help but cut in: &ldquo;grandfather, how can I seem to have heard of your story, and it seems that many people have said that. In many storytelling stories, those great heroes are going to fall off a cliff like this&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Monday fairy glared at the little ring and said angrily, &ldquo;I said or you said, shut up. Er, what did I say? Well, I fell off the cliff, but I was lucky enough to survive. Then I found a secret book left by an old man who didn&rsquo;t know how many years ago. I was intelligent. I learned the secret collection under the cliff. I took the spirit of heaven and earth as food and traveled through time. Finally, I got the right result and became an immortal&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>GUI Li said coldly: &ldquo;what else do you look like an immortal besides your name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Monday, the immortal smothered for a while, his face was a little embarrassed, but then he returned to normal and said: &ldquo;I play for the sake of all the people in the world and do good deeds and accumulate virtues.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want to tell me that your skill of earth escaping is learned from that secret collection?&rdquo; he said</p>
<p>On Monday, the immortal nodded again and again, and said, &ldquo;yes, you can teach me.&rdquo; But after saying that, he turned his head to look around the people, not to say fierce, but to see small ring and wild dog Taoist face is also clearly put &ldquo;do not believe&rdquo; two words.</p>
<p>GUI Li looked at the man, and he would not believe it, but since Zhouxian said these things, anyway, he was not willing to say his origin and identity. However, although this person seems to be involved in Qingyun Mountain, he used to get along with him, and there is nothing wrong with it. What&rsquo;s more, in Gui Li&rsquo;s mind, he is more or less always looking at the three people, such as Zhouxian.</p>
<p>With this in mind, GUI Li stopped pushing each other, but he didn&rsquo;t want to say anything more. He just wanted to say a few words to them and left. Suddenly, a panic scream broke out in the crowd far away from the south of Heyang City, and the voice was extremely shrill.</p>
<p>All of them were startled and looked back. The people on the street nearby turned their heads together. They saw that the street was full of people, and the towering city wall was full of people, but they were running around now. In the misty rain water, there was a shrill scream in the sky. A huge Raptor opened its arms, and its big eyes twinkled with blood red and fierce light. From the sky, its wings spread out, and it was half the width of the city gate. It was really terrible.</p>
<p>The huge wind was driven by this giant bird, and the strong wind broke the mast on the wall and collapsed. At the top of the wall, people were so frightened that they ran around. The huge bird fell from the sky with a scream. The huge sharp claw of the bird was like a devil&rsquo;s hand. Shengsheng caught two people running, and then rose up and disappeared in the sky.</p>
<p>The whole Heyang city suddenly fell into a dead silence. After a long time, I don&rsquo;t know who was the first to scream: &ldquo;the beast demon, it&rsquo;s the beast demon, we&rsquo;re finished!&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a flash, the whole city fell into a hysteria, countless people howled and wailed, a chaos.</p>
<p>Only between heaven and earth misty rain, still quietly underground, as if nothing had happened! (to be continued. )</p>
