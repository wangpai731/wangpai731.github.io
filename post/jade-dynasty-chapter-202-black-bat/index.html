      <p>In the dark cave, there was a slight sound of footsteps, and a faint blue light flashed from the front. After the light, there is the figure of GUI Li and Jin Ping er.</p>
<p>The two men have entered the deep part of the ancient magic cave. However, the grotesque cave seems to never have an end. The dark and humid road twists and turns, and seems to extend forward endlessly. The light on the soul eating stick can only see the place six feet away at most in front of the body, and even further away, there is the deep darkness of silence.</p>
<p>Among them, it seems that there are mysterious eyes staring at the two intruders.</p>
<p>Jinpinger is not far behind the ghost. Somehow, she slowly feels that she has begun to feel a little nervous. At the end of the road, no one knows where or what will be waiting for them.</p>
<p>Even if she saw the ferocious monster at the moment, I was afraid that she could not shake her mind. However, the darkness of nothingness made her start to fret.</p>
<p>The fierce steps suddenly stopped.</p>
<p>Jinpinger&rsquo;s heart leaped and nearly hit his back. He quickly stopped his body, and at the same time his whole body was on guard. He looked around secretly and lowered his voice and said, &ldquo;what, have you found?&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li turned his head and looked at her. Under the faint blue light, the skin of the golden vase&rsquo;er looked a little strange. He was silent for a moment and said, &ldquo;your breath sounds a little disordered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jin Er&rsquo;s brow was cold for a moment, and then he straightened up.</p>
<p>Ghost Li looked at her, did not say anything more, and then turned to continue to walk slowly. After walking a few steps, he heard the woman behind him take a deep breath. A moment later, she followed up again, and her body and breath were calm.</p>
<p>From the back, the man&rsquo;s back is reflected in the Golden Vase&rsquo;s eyes, thick and thick. Steady, I don&rsquo;t know how, the Golden Vase son actually found that he had some sense of peace of mind. Just above his shoulder, the monkey was shrinking his head. It didn&rsquo;t seem energetic, only the long tail hung down and swayed back and forth with the stride of the ghost.</p>
<p>In the dark, the light of the ghost is very soft. Blood sucking beads once possessed the power of killing the spirit demon, but now it seems that they have all disappeared.</p>
<p>The light shoots across the stone wall, illuminating the past, and then slowly returns to the darkness. The Golden Vase looks around silently. After entering the ancient cave of demon suppressing, the unique Yin wind here is so cold that it can almost blow people&rsquo;s blood into ice. However, as they went deeper and deeper into the ancient cave, the Yin wind was not stronger, but gradually weakened.</p>
<p>And where they are now. Almost can not feel the existence of the wind, but without the wind, there is a dead silence around. Looking at the place where the light is shining around, the Golden Vase&rsquo;s eyebrows are more and more wrinkled.</p>
<p>When entering this ancient cave, Jin pinger didn&rsquo;t notice the surrounding stone walls. However, after going deep into the cave, Jin pinger found that there were more and more traces of man-made building in the depths of the legendary demon suppressing cave. On the surrounding stone walls. Although the years are long, but the smooth appearance is not natural can form, even the road under their feet, although tortuous. However, there are few ups and downs. All the way forward, it was unexpected difficulties.</p>
<p>And in this cave, there is no smell of the devil. There are no terrible human and animal skeletons on the ground. It seems that it is just a clean and quiet place, where it is like the residence of the first devil in the world.</p>
<p>In this way, they turned another corner.</p>
<p>The darkness suddenly became strong, like an invisible wall. The light emitted by the soul eating soul was rebounded by the invisible wall in front of them at the moment when they turned around. Almost at the same time, GUI Li and Jin Ping er&rsquo;s body stopped and quickly floated out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boom!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A muffled sound, just now they stand on the ground, exploded two big holes, broken stones randomly shot, hit the surrounding rock wall collapse sound.</p>
<p>The darkness, like a roar, dashed round the corner like a mountain and fell upon it. Until now, GUI Li and Jin Ping&rsquo;er still can&rsquo;t see what monsters and demons are among them. Jin Ping&rsquo;er&rsquo;s face is slightly white, and his body moves slightly, which is already flashing in the back of a Zhang&rsquo;s distance.</p>
<p>In the strong wind, suddenly the blue light was full, and the whole figure was covered by the blue halo. Standing under the seemingly boundless darkness, he looked at the black wall coldly. Even the little grey monkey on his shoulder, his three eyes also lit up, flashing light gold.</p>
<p>Under the black curtain, the wind was so strong that even the stones just scattered on the ground were shot again. However, in the darkness, the ghostly figure was still, and the blue light was not dim but strong. The strong light burst from his right hand. In a moment, his palm was stretched out and inserted into the darkness.</p>
<p>The strong blue light that originally haunted the edge of GUI Li&rsquo;s right hand suddenly disappeared at the moment when his palm was inserted into the darkness. It seemed to be covered by some object. But after a moment, there was a loud noise. The sound of &ldquo;aggressive&rdquo; was heard in the black curtain. After a while, he was torn open seven times by hard life, and the brilliant blue light came from it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roar&hellip;&rdquo; A painful roar suddenly burst out from the front. The black curtain of the mountain suddenly spread, and it was still dark. But in the dark, two huge red eyes were exposed.</p>
<p>With the help of this light, GUI Li and the Gold Vase standing behind can see clearly. It turned out that the one guarding here was a huge black bat, all black, with only two eyes showing blood red color. It must have been the huge body and bat wings that blocked the eyes just now, so I couldn&rsquo;t see the real body of the monster for a moment. But I&rsquo;m afraid that the attack of these monsters is just like this. It&rsquo;s really easy to panic and do not know how to deal with the sudden attack in the dark.</p>
<p>At the moment, the black demon bat&rsquo;s bat wing was opened seven wounds by the ghost. The strange light blue blood sprinkled on the body, which was obviously hurt. However, these monsters were never timid. Instead, they seemed to fall into a rage. They opened their mouths and roared, and the bat wings opened. Although they were unstable, the darkness flourished again and flew over.</p>
<p>The cold light in Gui Li&rsquo;s eyes flashed, and the blood sucking demon light on the top of the soul eating magic wand was lit up at the same time, and the demon bat was about to pounce on it. All of a sudden, he heard a whistling sound of &ldquo;creak&rdquo; on his shoulder, and the gray shadow flashed by. It was actually Xiao Hui who jumped out of his shoulder and rushed to the monster which was countless times bigger than the monkey&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p>The ghost frowned. Even the Gold Vase standing behind was stunned. At a glance, the two animals were so different in shape that they swept across the air.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the Golden Vase son thought so, and even slightly worried about the monkey.</p>
<p>In the light of the blue light, Xiaohui&rsquo;s body is growing bigger and bigger, but in a short time, it has changed from a little gray monkey less than three feet into a three eyed monkey that almost fills the whole cave space, howls furiously and has three red eyes.</p>
<p>Two giant beasts collided in midair.</p>
<p>The surrounding stone walls seemed unable to withstand such a huge impact and began to shake violently. The Gold Vase even felt the ground under her feet began to shake. But standing in front of the two monsters not far away. His face slowly returned to calm, and the corners of his mouth seemed to have a faint smile. He did not put the stones around him like rain and murderous in his eyes.</p>
<p>The giant black bat was obviously frightened by the sudden appearance of the great ape, but still fiercely rushed over, only the gray shadow passed by. The little gray quickly flashed in between the bat&rsquo;s claws. Two huge palms grabbed forward and caught the two wing roots close to the body of the demon bat.</p>
<p>The demon bat gave out a shrill scream, as if it felt fear for the first time, but the three red eyes in front of it were more terrible than it. Sharp fangs flashed through the darkness, then roared up into the sky.</p>
<p>The howling sound, like a torrent, roared away in the cave, unstoppable. As if in the face of all things in this world, defiant general provocation!</p>
<p>Under the flicker of black and blue light, the alternation of ferocity and anger, the giant ape roared, waving its huge arm, like a demon laughing and dancing!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hiss!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The blue blood splashed in an instant. The huge black demon bat was torn in two by the three eyed monkey and thrown away far away.</p>
<p>In the distance, the long howling echo still reverberates layer by layer, endless.</p>
<p>The power of anger, even so!</p>
<p>The ape slowly turned around and looked down. The man was still standing there, looking at it.</p>
<p>The blood red light in its eyes slowly disappeared. Suddenly, it reached out and grabbed its head. With a grin, it quickly shrunk back to its original size and turned into a small gray.</p>
<p>It squats on the ground, turns its head, looks at the host, the right hand touches the head from time to time, and the long tail behind him gently shakes.</p>
<p>GUI Li looks at Xiao Hui, and has a gentle smile in his eyes. Only when he is facing this monkey can he smile with all his heart!</p>
<p>He smiles and reaches out his hand.</p>
<p>Small ash &ldquo;squeak and squeak&rdquo; screamed a few times, a spring of feet, two or three times and then ran up the ghostly shoulder, lying down, grinning non-stop, very happy look.</p>
<p>GUI Li thought for a while, and then reached out to lift the monkey&rsquo;s little ash. He held it in his hands and raised it to his body. He looked up and down carefully. The three eyes of the grey haired monkey blinked together, and he didn&rsquo;t know what GUI Li wanted to do.</p>
<p>At this time, the Golden Vase son also slowly came forward, standing on one side, looking at the ghost, thinking on his face, and not knowing what he was thinking.</p>
<p>GUI Li looked at Xiao Hui for a moment, nodded and put it back on his shoulder. Then he touched his head and suddenly said with a smile: &ldquo;after going out, I&rsquo;ll buy you wine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jin Ping&rsquo;er is in a trance of meditation. Lengbu Ding&rsquo;s words are in his ears. He doesn&rsquo;t respond for a moment. He opens his mouth in amazement. There is a moment of blank in his mind. On the contrary, the monkey was stunned for a moment, and then he jumped with joy. He kept laughing and jumping around with his teeth and claws on his ghostly shoulders. After a moment, he seemed to suddenly wake up. He took off the big wine bag which had been on his back for a long time but had been empty. Without looking at it, he threw it vigorously into the ground, making a &ldquo;crack&rdquo; sound, and the dust flew high.</p>
<p>With a smile, he walked forward and gradually melted into the darkness. However, under the blue light, his figure was so bright in the dark, and the happy figure of the gray monkey was so harmonious with him, as if it were a whole and could not be separated.</p>
<p>Gold bottle son slowly walked on a few steps, looking at the figure of a man and a monkey, can not help but have a kind of cold feeling. But unconsciously, the surrounding lost the ghost biting blue light, gradually dark down, gold bottle son reaction, a stretch of the right hand, purple light up, re light around.</p>
<p>She was calm and just wanted to speed up her pace and catch up with the devil. All of a sudden, a dark figure swayed in the darkness ahead, and ran to her unexpectedly.</p>
<p>Jin Ping&rsquo;er was startled and quickly concentrated on the alert. Unexpectedly, the figure ran to the nearest place. Under the purple light, it turned out to be monkey grey.</p>
<p>Jin pinger frowned, but she was still relieved. I don&rsquo;t know what happened to this monkey, who was as strange as its owner, but also extremely powerful.</p>
<p>Little ash jumped to the Golden Vase a few times. Looking around, he suddenly looked angry and roared at the Golden Vase.</p>
<p>Gold bottle son one Zheng, spread out both hands, surprised way: &ldquo;what do you do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohui&rsquo;s three eyes stare at the Golden Vase. The Golden Vase is originally a gorgeous beauty, but apparently this beauty has no effect on the monkey. Xiaohui looks angry and points at his feet.</p>
<p>The Golden Vase looked down and said, &ldquo;ah.&rdquo;. Step back, but I just stepped on the big wine bag that Xiao Hui lost just now.</p>
<p>Angry, Xiaohui picked up the wine bag again, patted the dust with his hand, and actually hung the big wine bag on his body again.</p>
<p>Jinpinger was angry and funny in her heart. She said angrily, &ldquo;Hey, dead monkey, you threw it away by yourself. What are you doing to me so hard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Small gray to the golden bottle &ldquo;squeak&rdquo; two strange, bared his teeth and made a grimace. Then &ldquo;whoosh&rdquo; of a backward run back, blink of an eye disappeared in the front of the dark, is obviously chasing ghosts.</p>
<p>The golden vase&rsquo;er was stunned for a moment, and finally shook his head with a bitter smile. Follow up.</p>
<p>Deep in the ancient cave, the fire in the fire pot is still burning lonely. The dust laden past seems to be still reverberating in this silent cave. The beast God and the mysterious woman in the dark did not speak. They were all silent, as if they were still immersed in the unforgettable past. Even one side of the Taotie, also some tired like lying on the ground. It seems to be asleep.</p>
<p>But it was in this silence that suddenly, Taotie suddenly raised his head from between his two claws. The huge copper bell&rsquo;s huge eyes glared at the far exit direction, and his mouth made a harsh roar with a trace of uneasiness.</p>
<p>The beast God slowly opened his eyes, slightly frowned, and in the dark, it seems that the woman also &ldquo;Yi&rdquo;.</p>
<p>That faint howl, although it has become a little weak, but still from the distance, such as wild wild wild animals rushed, unscrupulously broke the silence, roared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone&rsquo;s coming.&rdquo; The light way of beast God.</p>
<p>The woman in the dark was silent for a moment, then suddenly sneered: &ldquo;someone can find this place. I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s mostly Yun Yilan. The old man sent someone to come and die, and touch your bottom by the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The beast God&rsquo;s face seemed to be so tired, or did not put anything in his heart. He said, &ldquo;whatever, I don&rsquo;t care, but can these people enter the cave so deep? Listening to the sound, it seems to have passed the place where the black bat is. However, if you can enter the cave, you can probably deal with black bats. But there is a black tiger at the cave entrance. They can come in quietly. There is no movement in the black tiger. It is not easy. &quot;</p>
<p>The woman in the dark suddenly said, &ldquo;since you are no longer immortal, can you deal with these enemies whose strength is unknown with your serious injury?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The beast God laughed and said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, but I&rsquo;m not worried.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; said the woman</p>
<p>The beast God smiles: &ldquo;have you in, what am I afraid of?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman was silent for a while and sneered: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s none of my business whether you die or not. Don&rsquo;t think I helped you once, and this time I will help you. Although you have some friendship with me, I can&rsquo;t tell when I&rsquo;ll turn over in the future. It&rsquo;s better to die early than you! &quot;</p>
<p>The beast God coughed twice and seemed to have some pain on his face, but the smile on the corner of his mouth did not diminish. He just looked at the dark place and said, &ldquo;I will die sooner or later. Don&rsquo;t worry. But before that, don&rsquo;t you have to understand the eight fierce XuanHuo array handed down by the witch clan? If I die, will you not be all in vain</p>
<p>The woman snorted and said, &ldquo;the array is here. What am I afraid of you doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The beast God said with a smile: &ldquo;there are only eight fierce XuanHuo arrays that have been handed down in the world, only here and the XuanHuo altar of incense burning valley. The map of burning incense Valley has been destroyed, so this is the only place left. You still don&rsquo;t understand the mysteries of the array. Only I can launch the array for you to understand. If you have XuanHuo in your hand, you can also activate the array. Unfortunately, you don&rsquo;t have it</p>
<p>When he said this, he stopped for a moment, and a trace of melancholy flashed on his face. He said, &ldquo;you know now, this array was set up by Linglong in order to restrain me. In case I die, the array will also disappear. In this way, you can&rsquo;t get anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman was silent and said for a long time, &ldquo;you are cruel! I&rsquo;ll take care of these people</p>
<p>The beast God slowly shook his head and said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not that I&rsquo;m cruel. It&rsquo;s you who are worried about that make you so subject to others. But&hellip; &quot; He slowly raised his eyes, looked into the deep darkness, and said, &ldquo;can you tell me who you are, and you must risk being with me to understand this array?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no answer. There was a silence around. It seemed that at that moment, the mysterious woman in the dark had gone far away.</p>
<p>The fire in the brazier was still burning, reflected in the eyes of the beast God.</p>
<p>Taotie slowly stood up and kept yelling. He was very upset.</p>
<p>The beast God looked at the darkness of nothingness in front of him, silent (to be continued.</p>
