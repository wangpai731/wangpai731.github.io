      <p>The hard ground, under the burning of the blazing fire, even began to have the sign of melting. The flaming flame continuously spurted out from the huge mouth of the red flame Warcraft, which had the momentum of destroying everything, turned this huge stone chamber space into a terrible sea of fire.</p>
<p>The ghostly figure disappeared in the fire from the beginning, and never appeared again.</p>
<p>After spitting out a wave of mountain fire, the flaming eyes of red flame Warcraft looked hard at the depth of the fire sea. It seemed that they were looking for something. They stopped for a moment. The hot flame was still burning on the ground, and the surrounding air seemed to be boiling.</p>
<p>However, GUI Li and the little grey monkey on his shoulder disappeared at the same time.</p>
<p>Has he been reduced to ashes?</p>
<p>A moment later, the answer appears. In the sky above the sea of fire, a ghostly figure appeared in the sky. In the twinkling of an eye, it was as fierce as a demon that it flashed over the red flame Warcraft and completely escaped the terrible flame. At the moment, in his hands, the blue light of the soul devouring wand reappeared. In the fire, his face was indifferent and calm.</p>
<p>Monkey Xiaohui on his shoulder, facing the giant Warcraft below, suddenly bared his teeth and growled. Obviously, he was excited to this old opponent. Even if he was a monkey, he had been around for so long. In his blood, more or less, there was a strong and fierce smell of blood sucking beads!</p>
<p>Red flame Warcraft sent out an earth shaking roar, the sound reverberated far away, as if thunder. Then, the huge body soared into the air, and in a moment, the atmosphere around was almost evaporated by the burning flame, leaving only the heat. The huge body, which flickered with fierce fire, came suddenly.</p>
<p>This time, however, he did not dodge. Looking at the ancient Warcraft which was countless times bigger than his body, his eyes seemed to flash a strange light. And behind the body of the red flame Warcraft, the weird eight fierce gods circle, still follow behind it, slowly rotating. Bright and uncertain, like a mysterious eye, coldly watching this fight.</p>
<p>At the top of soul eating magic wand, the dark red blood thread on the surface of blood phagocytic bead is in a moment. All of them lit up and met the flying fire. Instead of retreating, they met them face-to-face this time.</p>
<p>Red flame Warcraft seems to have never thought that this tiny human should confront himself face to face. However, his body was slightly smothered, but then the fire was even worse. In the roar, he bit down.</p>
<p>The huge sparks, like rain in the sky, fell one after another, but when they fell three feet around the ghost, they met the invisible barrier and were all bounced away. At the same time, the ghost still swept to the red flame Warcraft&rsquo;s body, that pair of burning flaming flame giant eyes. Almost in front of him.</p>
<p>The ghost is surrounded by many flames. Beside him, Xiao Hui gives out a scream. The soul eating magic stick goes forward and stabs the head of the red flame Warcraft.</p>
<p>The blue light, a moment of great prosperity, like a brilliant lotus in the fire light, then, the lotus deep. It seems that the blood is as bright as the incomparable red</p>
<p>Bright red!</p>
<p>In the warm air, blood sucking beads seem to be shaking slightly. The power of infusing them has not been so strong for many years. The blue breath whirled in the depth of the pearl body, as if roaring to kill.</p>
<p>It was clearly a sea of fire, but the surrounding temperature was in an instant cooling, cold breath fell from the sky, shrouded in red flame Warcraft. The first time. The ancient Guardian beast was instinctively afraid in amazement, but its stronger instinct made it roar more ferociously and bite down at the ghost again.</p>
<p>When the giant fell down, the flames roared down. At this time, the ghost stabbed the demon stick into the roaring mouth of red flame Warcraft.</p>
<p>The huge body stopped in mid air, and the air around was still as hot as before, but a cold, as if from the heart of the people, just like that. I don&rsquo;t know when to start, Xiao Hui still lies on the fierce shoulder, and his body has not changed. But among those three eyes, it seems that he has been stimulated by something, and has turned into red, which is very dazzling.</p>
<p>At the moment, seeing the red flame Warcraft under the fierce soul biting attack, the decline of the instant flash, small ash is the face of a ferocious image, toward the red flame Warcraft, showing fangs, a grim smile.</p>
<p>In a twinkling of an eye, the surrounding temperature continued to drop, and the high temperature on the red flame Warcraft also retreated, as if with a trace of indescribable fear in his flaming eyes.</p>
<p>The ghost of the empty sky and the rising of the spirit slowly rose up, and the red flames filled the whole magic weapon from the spirit magic wand that he had seen. It seemed that he was sucking the essence of the red flame warbler with every little bit of mercy.</p>
<p>There was a slight pain on his face, and there was a layer of red and yellow light on his face, but after three flashes, it was covered by a layer of golden light.</p>
<p>Red flame Warcraft can no longer support the huge body, fell down from the air, just a moment ago, the monster has become such a weak scene, if not seen with his own eyes, almost incredible. The flame in the stone chamber is rapidly dissipating, and the temperature is falling rapidly. Instead of the high temperature, it is extremely cold and cold from Gui Li&rsquo;s body, with a trace of evil smell.</p>
<p>The red flame Warcraft fell to the ground, and there was not much flame left on his body at the moment. From a distance, the guardian Warcraft seemed to have lost most of its power. After watching the slowly falling ghost with hatred, the red flame Warcraft finally let out a roar, and then the huge body slowly dissipated in the air.</p>
<p>However, although its body dissipated, the aura of the mysterious eight evil gods in the air did not disappear. Moreover, it did not seem to have been affected by the fighting method just now. It was still bright and uncertain. It slowly rotated and slowly retreated. Finally, it stopped on the old fire pot, which was still sitting in front of the beast God on the ground.</p>
<p>In the brazier, the fire was still burning.</p>
<p>This is the only flame and light in the cold breath which is shrouded by the ghoulish blood sucking Demon power. It seems that it is completely unaffected by the ghost force.</p>
<p>He fell to the ground again, but there was no joy of victory on his face. Looking at the burning flame, his pupils seemed to be shrinking slightly.</p>
<p>The mysterious circle of light, slowly rotating, eight ferocious and ferocious gods, in turn, light, dark and bright, as if in the mysterious telling something.</p>
<p>Under the aperture, is the beast God that with deep tired but still smiling face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;PA. PA, PA&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>The beast God clapped his hands, and said with a gentle smile, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s very powerful. It&rsquo;s amazing. I didn&rsquo;t expect you to have such a good moral conduct and such powerful magic weapons. Although I had expected you to be a good Taoist, I didn&rsquo;t expect to be so high. &quot;</p>
<p>He gave a low sigh. It seems that I&rsquo;m always wrong, isn&rsquo;t it</p>
<p>The ghost looked at him and said slowly, &ldquo;although the red flame Warcraft appeared this time, it was not as powerful as the one in the XuanHuo altar of the burning incense valley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The beast God looked at the ghost, did not speak, but in his eyes, he slowly had the meaning of approval and nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The red flame beast,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Clearly, it is the spirit beast protecting the eight fierce XuanHuo array passed down by the sorcerer family. So long as the array can be activated, it can summon such a class of Warcraft. However, the red flame Warcraft is the soul beast confined in the array. The greater the power of the dark fire contained in the array, the greater its power. &quot;</p>
<p>He glanced at the brazier in front of the beast, and said, &ldquo;this brazier is the&rdquo; gathering pot &ldquo;in legend, which can gather the world from the essence of fire.</p>
<p>The beast God laughed and said, &ldquo;yes, it&rsquo;s the hot pot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He nodded grimly. He said calmly: &ldquo;with this fire gathering basin, you can drive the dark fire with the power of leaving the fire, start the array, and summon the red flame Warcraft. But this magic weapon is magic. However, it may not be comparable to that in the underground of the xuanhuotan in the burning incense Valley, the fiery lava&rsquo;s abundant firepower for thousands of years has continuously supplied the array of Dharma. Therefore, the red flame Warcraft you summoned this time, although it seems to be very powerful, is just empty and empty. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha ha. &ldquo;Good, good,&rdquo; laughed the animal God, stroking his hands. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity that there&rsquo;s no one but you who can say that in this world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li took a deep look at him and said, &ldquo;at least, the person who beat you seriously is qualified to speak like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The beast God&rsquo;s smile was suddenly restrained, his face sank, and his eyes turned cold and looked at the ghost. He looked straight at his eyes and eyes, calmly relative, but also felt a frightening momentum, which was sent out from the sick and weak body.</p>
<p>The beast God looked at the ghost and said slowly, &ldquo;I heard that the man who hurt me seems to have a bit of a festival with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His fierce face changed.</p>
<p>The two men looked at each other and did not speak again, but the breath between the stone chambers seemed to have dropped to the freezing point.</p>
<p>At this time, all of a sudden, they both seemed to feel at the same time. The beast God raised his eyes slightly, but the ghost turned and looked at the entrance of the stone chamber.</p>
<p>That one eye, in the dark, such as startled, in the heart of the scratch marks</p>
<p>Red flame Warcraft has disappeared, the whole huge stone chamber, again into the dark, only in front of the beast God in the fire pot, there is a fire quietly burning, illuminating the nearby small place, emitting some light and warmth. Even the halo of the eight evil gods slowly rotating above the fire pot is not so dazzling.</p>
<p>However, at that moment, in the dark depths, a figure, gently covered by the light blue gentle light, stood there quietly, with a familiar face, a startled moment, as if thousands of years had passed.</p>
<p>Staring at her.</p>
<p>Step by step, step by step.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s hand, in the dim light, looks very pale. I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s because she grabs Tianya too hard. But her face, but it seems that there is no emotion, as the first meeting, that cold woman.</p>
<p>Slowly, she approached.</p>
<p>Walk up to him and stand.</p>
<p>No words, no words, her eyes, now only left the reflection of the flame. At that moment, how long did it take?</p>
<p>The beast God looked at this man and a woman in silence. He did not say anything or do anything. In his eyes that could never be seen clearly, who could understand the flashing complex expression?</p>
<p>Stand side by side with him.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s eyes, after coming, never looked at the ghost.</p>
<p>After a long time, in the quiet and slightly strange atmosphere, she was only heard low and calm, but it seemed that there was an unspeakable feeling in the calm, and whispered: &ldquo;so It&rsquo;s really you&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>GUI Li didn&rsquo;t speak. He looked at the graceful and beautiful face of the woman in front of him. After a long time. He did only one thing.</p>
<p>He turned to her, slowly——</p>
<p>smile.</p>
<p>Then he stood by her side. Standing side by side, breathing deeply, the flame echoing from the depth of the chest seems to warm the whole heart.</p>
<p>Xu felt something like snow. Her face was a little pale in the faint red, but she did not have any cover, she just - in the frost like face, toward the front, towards the group of warm flame, reflected in her eyes of the flame, smile.</p>
<p>So, warm, smile!</p>
<p>Two figures. Standing side by side, looking at the beast God, facing the incomparable devil in this world.</p>
<p>In the eyes of the beast God, however, there was a look of pain and slowly lowered his head.</p>
<p>The fire was still burning, and the scene in the stone chamber seemed to be hazy in the light of the fire. The three figures stood for a long time.</p>
<p>Until, the beast God raised his head again.</p>
<p>After a moment&rsquo;s gaze on Lu Xueqi, she falls on GUI Li and suddenly says, &ldquo;you promise me something, OK?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was stunned. I never thought that he would say such a thing. He didn&rsquo;t know how to answer it for a moment. He only got the answer: &ldquo;what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The beast God&rsquo;s face had a deep and deep weariness, and said faintly, &ldquo;you two will fight with me no matter what your purpose is. If you die of my hand. Naturally, there&rsquo;s nothing to say. If I lose, I won&rsquo;t blame you. I just hope you can do something for me after you get out of this ancient cave. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say it,&rdquo; he said</p>
<p>The beast God was silent for a moment and said, &ldquo;you remember there is a stone statue at the entrance of the cave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a strange look on his face. He nodded slowly and said, &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The animal God&rsquo;s voice became low and said, &ldquo;if you have a chance to go out, pick a bunch of her favorite lilies for me and put them in front of her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lily I see. &quot; GUI Li nodded slowly, but in his tone, it seemed that there was a little more strange emotion. Lu Xueqi felt it, but did not speak. She just looked at him silently.</p>
<p>The beast God shook his head and seemed to laugh at himself. Then he said with a smile to the ghost: &ldquo;but what about you! If you stay here and have no chance to go out again, what will you want? &quot;</p>
<p>His eyes fell slowly on Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s face from the ghostly body, smiling slightly. His eyes seemed to be flashing a strange light, saying: &ldquo;how about you! Do you have any wish to say? &quot;</p>
<p>She was silent, and Lu Xueqi did not speak. After a while, Lu Xueqi quietly looked at the ghost. On his face, there was a vague and complicated look, with a bit of pain.</p>
<p>She took a deep breath and suddenly said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have a bigger wish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This sentence, although her tone is flat, but what she said is decisive, not to give herself half a minute of leeway.</p>
<p>Perhaps, she really did not want to, no longer want to, what room to give themselves?</p>
<p>The body of ghostly fierce, shake a shock.</p>
<p>Then he looked at the woman next to him.</p>
<p>Deep gaze.</p>
<p>No words.</p>
<p>The beast God looked at Lu Xueqi, but the light in his eyes was more and more bright. All of a sudden, he clapped his hands. Although he was still shaking, he still stood up. Bright silk clothes swept past him, and the evil beast Taotie also stood up and roared in a low voice beside his master.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good, good, well said!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Looking at Lu Xueqi, the beast God&rsquo;s eyes were filled with inexplicable fanaticism. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, that&rsquo;s it. Women in this world are just like her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked up at the sky and laughed like a madman. At the end of the laugh, he was like a howl, with a little whimper. With his body shaking, an inexplicable breath rises slowly. The original quiet and slow rotation of the eight evil gods circle suddenly starts to speed up, and the eight statues light up at the same time.</p>
<p>It seems that the ancient fierce breath from the ancient gods and demons, which is different from the previous red flame Warcraft, immediately diffused away, and the fire in the ancient fire pot, under the Demon power, grows slowly again.</p>
<p>This time, the burning flame left the brazier slowly, just like the body inlaid in the halo of the mysterious eight evil gods, and ascended into the air with the eight evil gods, burning fiercely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. The red flame Warcraft I summoned is not as good as the magic array in xuanhuotan because of the lack of power of XuanHuo.&rdquo; after the aperture, red light appeared on the pale face of the beast God. It seems that because of the arrival of the peerless Demon power, he also revived. &ldquo;But the array here was set by Linglong himself, which was far better than that of the relics of xuanhuotan Let&rsquo;s show you the mysteries. &quot;</p>
<p>In his long shrill laughter, his whole body floated into the air, slowly integrated into the growing fire, and finally disappeared. On the ground, he roared loudly.</p>
<p>At the next moment, on top of the eight evil gods, suddenly, the eyes of all the gods suddenly glowed with red light, like the devil waking up again. In an instant, the gods and Demons howled and screamed, deafening.</p>
<p>The flame burned more and more intensely, and the deep flame began to make a rumbling sound like thunder, and the center of the flame gradually turned into pure white. Even after a long distance of walking in the Guili and Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s ways, it was unbearably hot.</p>
<p>In the roar of demons all over the sky, the voice of mysterious incantation reverberates. The incantation is obscure and long, ancient and profound. It seems that the ancient ancestors worshipped the gods and summoned the gods in their dreams with all their faith and spiritual power.</p>
<p>Flame, burn!</p>
<p>The spell was like a storm, tearing people&rsquo;s hearts.</p>
<p>In the sound of the incantation, suddenly, a huge and irresistible momentum suddenly emanated from the depths of the huge flame. The power was so powerful that Gui Li and Lu Xueqi could not resist and were forced to fly backward.</p>
<p>What terrible mantra is it, and what terrible spirit is summoned that has such power?</p>
<p>For a while, GUI Li and Lu Xueqi changed their color together. Where is the strength that human can resist?</p>
<p>The flame was burning wildly, and the flame danced like a demon in the air, welcoming the arrival of terror in the depth of the flame. The most blazing place, almost pure white fireworks heart, suddenly, in the violent flash, like some kind of creature, slowly gasping, opened his eyes.</p>
<p>In an instant, the surrounding ancient and hard rock walls were broken one after another, and countless huge cracks appeared on the ground, and from the depths of the cracks, there was even more red light, as if under the feet, there was a terrible volcanic lava, which was about to erupt.</p>
<p>And the sound of breathing, like a dragon chant, in this space</p>
<p>Echo! (to be continued. )</p>
