      <p>The blood pool is deep in the cave of guiwangzong in Huqi mountain.</p>
<p>The huge space is still covered by a strong smell of blood, even the hard stone walls have been dyed with bright blood red color. In the pool of blood bubbling with bubbles from the depths of blood, the four ancient spirit beasts all showed tired and powerless appearance. Immersed in the blood pool, the dark red light and shadow shot from the mysterious and empty volong tripod in the sky now looks much dimmer than before. On the contrary, the Fu Long Ding in the air and in the air is full of aura and perfection. Even the mysterious inscriptions on the tripod have already glittered, and the strange devil head carved on the front of the Fulong Ding has completely changed into blood red, and there is a strange force hovering on it.</p>
<p>In the huge cavern where the whole blood pool is located, there is no sound except for the occasional sound of bubbles bursting from the blood pool under your feet. However, when you are inside, you feel as if you are in a torrent whirlpool. An invisible but huge force has awakened from the dark and gradually grown up and peeped into the world.</p>
<p>There is no wind, but the skirt is fluttering.</p>
<p>Mr. ghost in black clearly felt the cold and bloody power hovering around his body at the moment, but in his eyes, in addition to the strange heat, there was not a trace of fear in his eyes. His eyes moved away from the Fulong tripod in mid air and slowly looked around the huge cave. It was obvious that this was the source of the mysterious and bloody power in the ghost King clan. Under the ever-increasing power, even the passageways in the cave at the foot of the ghost King clan were scarred, and the stone walls here were more and more unbearable.</p>
<p>The largest crack is as wide as a ten foot wide, and the small one is three feet above. The hard wall here is like a thin paper, torn apart at will. It looks like some ancient god who broke the sky and cut the sea.</p>
<p>Today, the ghost King rarely came to the blood pool. However, Mr. ghost knows why. The ghost king went to see the thousand year old Nine Tailed Tianhu who came back unexpectedly a few days ago. He wanted to follow the thousand year Taoist practice of the Nine Tailed Tianhu. He was afraid that he would not find all kinds of strange things in the ghost King&rsquo;s clan. But Mr. ghost wants to be here. Under the black veil, however, he gave a cold smile, and obviously did not pay any attention to it. After a while, his eyes returned to the Fulong tripod.</p>
<p>Red light shining, as if there is a special frequency. It was like a kind of strange gasp. The blood red eyes on the Dragon tripod flashed, and it seemed that the devil was standing up against the ghost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shura&hellip;&rdquo; Ghost Mr. mouth gently called out this strange words, slowly knelt down, spread out his hands and prostrate on the ground.</p>
<p>The strange light in the air seems to be more intense.</p>
<p>But at this seemingly quiet moment, suddenly, the blood red light on the Fulong tripod swayed. It seemed to be stimulated by something, and then he did not wait for Mr. ghost to react. He felt a sudden shock in his ears, and an invisible sound wave roared through him like a raging wave. His way of doing was still faintly painful. However, the mysterious huge power that originally hovered quietly in the huge cave suddenly seemed to solidify suddenly. Then, the strange whistling sound gradually sounded, which had the meaning of roaring and roaring.</p>
<p>This strange situation, even ghost Mr. also greatly unexpected, completely unknown, so he jumped up. Staring at the Dragon tripod hanging in the air, his eyes suddenly froze, and he saw the devil&rsquo;s face which had been completely turned into blood red on the Fulong tripod. At the moment, in the middle of the forehead, somehow, a small spot with faint white and soft brilliance suddenly appeared. This white light was out of proportion to the bloody atmosphere that enveloped the whole cave. However, somehow, not only the mysterious power from the Fulong tripod could not eliminate it, it was under the cover of the blood light with amazing roaring power. That little bit of white shimmer is still glittering, not weakened.</p>
<p>Mr. ghost&rsquo;s body was shocked, and his face was completely blooded. He lost his voice and said, &ldquo;heaven and earth lock How could it be? &quot;</p>
<p>It seems that the sudden blow is too big, and Mr. ghost, who has always been calm, is stunned. Walking up and down the platform under the Fulong Ding, he murmured to himself: &ldquo;impossible, impossible. How could there be such prohibition of ancient divine law on the Fulong tripod? What&rsquo;s the matter</p>
<p>Suddenly, his body was stiff again. Almost at the same time of his keen sense, the mysterious white light on the demon&rsquo;s face on the Fulong tripod suddenly became bright, and a soft white light spurted out, like a sharp dagger, which was particularly dazzling in the blood red light all over the sky.</p>
<p>From a distance, the white light dagger seemed to have been inserted in the middle of the devil&rsquo;s face and nailed the face tightly.</p>
<p>&quot;</p>
<p>In the whole cave, a sharp whistling sound suddenly sounded. The Red Mansions all over the sky whirled rapidly. Powerful forces filled the whole space. The stone walls around the cave even began to shake, and huge stones fell one after another. In the blood pool, there were countless huge whirlpools on the blood water. Four spirit beasts looked up to the sky powerlessly in the blood Know what to do. In the center of the storm, the blood red light on the devil&rsquo;s face trembled violently and flickered. It was seen that the twisted and ferocious pole was extremely fierce.</p>
<p>However, under the terrible power of incomparable power, in the surrounding surging blood, the pale white brilliance stands arrogantly. Those terrible forces can destroy the heaven and the earth, but they can&rsquo;t do anything about it. Mr. Ren was still staring at the bloody face of the devil.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how long later, this terrible force finally weakened, the rapidly rotating blood awn gradually subsided, and the changes in the blood pool cave were also slowly quiet. In Mr. GUI&rsquo;s somewhat desperate eyes, the blood red devil face, which was already close to completion, was forced back by the soft white light dagger, and the blood on the whole Fulong tripod was forced back Color, light and shadow, actually also dim a lot. &ldquo;How can it be, how can it be&hellip;&rdquo; With a bit of desolation, Mr. ghost stood on the platform. It looks like dead, lifeless. In front of him, the mysterious power on the Fulong tripod actually consumed his whole life to pursue. It was not too much that he was entrusted by his life. How could he expect that this kind of change would occur in the file mouth which was about to succeed! &ldquo;No. No, it&rsquo;s not a complete failure. You can&rsquo;t rush, you can&rsquo;t rush&hellip; &quot; After all, Mr. ghost is not an ordinary person. He took a deep breath, calmed himself down, and began to think quickly. Although the mysterious power on the Fulong tripod was suppressed by the sudden appearance of the lock of heaven and earth, which was forbidden by the ancient divine law, it was still not defeated. It&rsquo;s just that the harm must be sealed tightly and no breakthrough can be made. As long as the lock of heaven and earth is broken, it will be a great success.</p>
<p>However, although Mr. GUI thinks highly of himself, he is not arrogant enough to think that he can untie the ancient divine Dharma. According to legend, this supreme ancient divine Dharma was used by ancient gods to protect heaven and earth from evil spirits. Except for a few ancient artifacts, it is not human.</p>
<p>However, the so-called ancient artifact. Not to mention that it has been handed down to the world, it is because people like him, who are almost omniscient and profound, have never heard of it, but only know that there is such an ancient legend. At this moment, where can we find any ancient artifacts?</p>
<p>With this in mind, Mr. ghost&rsquo;s body was on the verge of falling, and he suddenly cried out and spat out a mouthful of blood. The blood was red and fell on the platform.</p>
<p>In the cold stone room, GUI Li and the ghost king looked at each other in silence. The ghost King&rsquo;s look is solemn, his eyes are sharp, and his face is more indifferent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the jade plate in your hand? Why did you take it to Biyao?&rdquo; The ghost king asked coldly.</p>
<p>GUI Li didn&rsquo;t answer, took back his eyes and returned to Biyao. After half pay, he said slowly, &ldquo;I want to save her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a frown on his brow and a twinkle in his eyes, the ghost King walked over quickly and said, &ldquo;can this magic weapon save Yao&rsquo;er?&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li looked at the soft white light in the hands of the &ldquo;heaven and earth samsara plate&rdquo;, suddenly wryly smile, way: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost king was stunned and said, &ldquo;what do you mean by that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was silent for a moment and said, &ldquo;I just heard people say that this magic weapon is quite effective, or there is hope that it can cure Biyao. Therefore, I went to borrow it. I can&rsquo;t tell exactly how it works.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost king looked at the samsara plate of heaven and earth, and his eyes solidified. He was obviously surprised by the strange shape of the jade. But with his insight, he had never heard of this magic weapon. He frowned and said, &ldquo;what is the name of this magic weapon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li said: &ldquo;this treasure is the samsara plate of heaven and earth. It is said that this treasure can fix the soul and cut off life and death, but how&hellip;&rdquo; He flashed in his mind the haggard appearance of master Pude, and said with a bitter smile, &ldquo;how this is, but no one knows.&rdquo; The ghost King&rsquo;s angry face flashed by, and red silk appeared in his eyes, which implied a killing intention. But after a moment, he looked at Biyao. The reflection of his smiling and peaceful smile seemed to feel something in his eyes. His eyes finally softened slowly.</p>
<p>Maybe, at this moment, only Biyao can make him quiet for a while!</p>
<p>&ldquo;This treasure is not ordinary!&rdquo; The ghost king suddenly said, &ldquo;I can see that although I have never heard of this magic weapon, the jade is of extraordinary quality. Its light is simple and does not disperse. It&rsquo;s absolutely unusual. Try it quickly. Maybe Maybe it will work wonders, maybe&hellip; &quot; Speaking of this, his voice was also low. However, during the whole ten years, he also experienced countless setbacks and failures, even though he still retained a hope, but both men understood that taking it was only a little bit of hope in the end.</p>
<p>GUI Li nodded silently and put the heaven and earth samsara plate in his hand. Close to Biyao, he saw the white soft light flowing, but there was no change at all. With a fluke heart, GUI Li inputs Zhenyuan into the jade plate, but the heaven and earth cycle plate is like a deep sea, and the input of Zhenyuan is like a clay ox into the sea, and there is no life again, and there is no change on the jade plate. GUI Li was not surprised. In fact, he had used many methods to test the jade plate before he returned to Huqi mountain, including the input method of true elements. However, all of them ended in failure. On that day, master Pude of Tianyin Temple understood this strange treasure for decades, but he did not get any. In order to let GUI Li think of any method in the past few days, master Pude would have tried it Not a hundred times.</p>
<p>In fact, GUI Li didn&rsquo;t understand these things, but in any case, he couldn&rsquo;t put down a little hope to cure Biyao. I had no choice but to try my best and hope that there will always be a miracle. But in the end, I still failed. &quot;</p>
<p>GUI Li hung his head and sat in the same place. The ghost King&rsquo;s face flashed with disappointment, but he didn&rsquo;t scold him. He didn&rsquo;t take a look at the strange jade plate in person. Although they had not been in a good relationship recently, the ghost king had a good idea of how he treated Biyao. As long as there is a glimmer of hope, GUI Li will definitely not give up. This time, of course, all kinds of methods have been tried.</p>
<p>He sighed a long sigh, and his appearance seemed to be a little old. He shook his head in silence and was about to leave. Suddenly, he suddenly turned around, as if he had remembered something, and then he suddenly turned to the ghost and said, &ldquo;would you try to put the&rdquo; hehuanling &ldquo;and the jade plate together to have a look</p>
<p>He was stunned. Then he woke up, and a nervous color flashed on his face. He reached close to Biyao and gently opened the skin. She put her hands across the palms and tentacles of her chest. She felt that although her skin was still smooth and plump, it was extremely cold.</p>
<p>GUI Li&rsquo;s heart is sour, dare not think about it any more. He carefully takes out the Hehuan bell which is in the hands of Biyao.</p>
<p>The golden and huanling bells made a clear sound as they rocked gently. Light light flashed, like the eyes of a beautiful lover, watching him.</p>
<p>GUI Li held Qiankun samsara plate in one hand, and he Huan bell in the other hand, and put it down gently toward the jade plate. Those strange little jade blocks in the samsara disk of heaven and earth are still moving silently, with mountains, rivers, stars all over the sky.</p>
<p>Under the eyes of GUI Li and GUI Wang, gradually, he Huan Ling entered the top of the heaven and earth samsara plate. When there was still a foot away, GUI Li suddenly felt something. He frowned and his eyes flashed a trace of surprise.</p>
<p>The ghost king felt it immediately. Staring at him, he said, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li didn&rsquo;t speak, just took a deep breath, and then suddenly let go of his finger, which was a foot high above the jade plate.</p>
<p>The ghost king was surprised.</p>
<p>In the white and soft light of the samsara plate of heaven and earth, the bell of Hehuan did not fall, and it seemed to be floating by some invisible force. In the white light slowly undulating, a moment later, the melodious sound of the bell.</p>
<p>GUI Li and GUI Wang showed a surprise color at the same time!</p>
<p>But at this critical moment, before the two of them were surprised for a moment, the whole cold stone room, no, the whole Huqi mountain, suddenly and violently vibrated. A huge and terrifying invisible force with a strong smell of blood suddenly burst out from the bottom of his door. It was like a giant beast suddenly stimulated and roared To break free of bondage.</p>
<p>GUI Li and GUI Wang changed color at the same time. The difference is that Gui Li is e ran, but in Gui Wang&rsquo;s eyes it is startled and angry!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pa Pa Pa Pa Pa Pa &quot;</p>
<p>The shrill roar came from all directions at the same time. The ghost and the ghost king turned around and saw that the stone wall of the ice stone chamber, which was still in good condition, was finally unable to hold on in the sudden outbreak of uncontrollable power. The walls on all sides cracked at the same time, and the crack was spreading at a visible speed. At the same time, the land under their feet began to shake violently Come on, there&rsquo;s an illusion of the end of the world.</p>
<p>Outside the stone chamber, there began to be shouts of panic, accompanied by more and louder roars. You don&rsquo;t need to look at GUI Li and GUI Wang. They know that the situation outside can only be worse than that in the cold stone room. But at this moment, where do they have the mind to manage.</p>
<p>GUI Li clenched his teeth and held up the heaven and earth samsara plate, close to Biyao. At the same time, the Hehuan bell trembled slightly. The clear bell sound was so different from the fierce roar around. Although it was weak, it was in the ears of GUI Li and GUI Wang. The sound was louder than the real one.</p>
<p>In the white and soft light of the samsara disk of heaven and earth, the bell of Albizzia julibrissin floated and sank in the air, trembling more and more fiercely, and the sound of the bell was also tense and slow. There was a faint sense of pain. Both GUI Li and GUI Wang were sweating on their forehead. They didn&rsquo;t even dare to blink their eyes. They fixed their eyes on the trembling Albizzia bell.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, the huge and strange force around them disappeared in an instant, and the roar around them stopped. Only the echo echoing in the distance still had the traces of the drastic change just now, such as the water absorption of the long whale, the terrible force quickly recovered.</p>
<p>This is the moment when Mr. GUI saw in the blood pool deep in Huqi mountain that the ancient divine law banned the lock of heaven and earth, showing great power, and deeply sealed the Fulong Ding.</p>
<p>In front of the ghosts and ghosts, things have changed.</p>
<p>It turned out that the bell of Albizzia julibrissin had a strange change in the brilliance of the Qiankun samsara plate, and there was a faint relief. However, the Qiankun samsara plate itself did not change at all, but when the power suddenly disappeared, the Qiankun samsara plate suddenly seemed to feel something. There was an invisible force calling for each other in the dark, and the originally soft white light suddenly rose.</p>
<p>GUI Li and the ghost King&rsquo;s body are big shock, lose voice way: &ldquo;what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The white light on the jade plate instantly became dazzling, almost impossible to look directly at, and the speed of the countless small pieces of jade sliding in the center of the jade plate. The speed is ten times faster than before. There are countless pieces of jade gliding and galloping. It&rsquo;s hard to distinguish them, and each piece of them is originally engraved with strange characters. They all lit up one by one.</p>
<p>With the change of the heaven and earth samsara disk, the trembling Albizzia bell quickly quieted down, even the bell became slow, and soon it was silent.</p>
<p>The ghost king was very anxious and said angrily, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li is also very anxious.</p>
<p>Gritted his teeth and said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand either!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the end of the day, even the stars and river patterns carved on the edge of the jade plate seemed to have come to life. The whole circle seemed to have got life. It was like calling something, and echoing something in the distance.</p>
<p>But in the brilliant light, the Albizzia bell seems to have been hit hard, and finally trembled slightly in mid air, as if it had completely lost its strength. Falling from the air, there was no more movement.</p>
<p>GUI Li and GUI Wang looked at the Huan bell in the heaven and earth samsara plate, their faces were as dead as ashes.</p>
<p>The underground changes have subsided for a long time, and the suddenly changed heaven and earth samsara plate has also returned to its original shape, no longer dazzling halo, but in the white and soft light shining, the Albizzia bell seems to have lost its vitality, no matter how fierce they try, they have no response.</p>
<p>The ghost King&rsquo;s face was gloomy and ugly, but the initial angry expression had disappeared from his face. Instead of that cold indifference, he silently watched the ghost, holding in case of hope to try, and then again and again witnessed his failure. Finally, he slowly straightened up. He closed his eyes, stood for a while, then quietly turned around and left the cold stone room without saying a word.</p>
<p>The stone gate closed slowly, and there was a huge crack across the heavy and hard stone, as if it had been torn apart. In the quiet stone chamber. GUI Li finally stopped his futile attempt and sat on the stone platform, motionless.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how long after that, GUI Li slowly picked up the Albizzia bell dropped in the heaven and earth samsara plate, gently put it back in the hands of Biyao, and then carefully crossed her hands on her chest according to the original appearance. His every movement is very careful and gentle, as if afraid of a little force, will hurt the sleeping woman in front of him.</p>
<p>He gazed at Biyao&rsquo;s face, as if he were crazy. After a long time, he heard his deep, hoarse voice and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Biyao, I didn&rsquo;t save you&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>After leaving the cold stone room, the ghost King&rsquo;s face changed greatly, and his indifferent expression was replaced by a violent air. His eyes also showed a murderous spirit, which was frightening.</p>
<p>He looked around coldly and saw that there were many wounds on all sides of the passageway, which were obviously given by the mysterious power that suddenly broke out just now. At the moment, the stone wall which had been cracked everywhere was even more fragile and had created more new cracks. Not to mention, many of the cracks that had been in the past were much too large. It was shocking to see that there was almost the illusion that the cave would collapse. In the distance of the passage, we can see that many disciples of the ghost King sect are running around and shouting one after another. It is obvious that people are frightened.</p>
<p>The ghost King&rsquo;s face was more gloomy and angry. As soon as he turned and strode, his figure disappeared in the depth of the passage. After a short period of time, the ghost king had already arrived at the blood pool deep in the cave.</p>
<p>In the big blood pool space, the strong blood gas is still coming, but the amazing red mansions that once caused troubles have been strangely weakened. The ghost King frowned, and then saw Mr. ghost&rsquo;s black figure standing alone on the platform.</p>
<p>He strode over to Mr. ghost without thinking about it. He said coldly, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter? When I left, I was still OK. Why did the power of Fulong Ding suddenly lose control so much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost&rsquo;s body moved slightly, but he didn&rsquo;t turn around. The ghost king was more and more angry. He snorted coldly, and his murderous spirit flashed on his face. He said, &ldquo;I tell you, most of the reason just now was that the divine power was out of control or my Yao&rsquo;er&rsquo;s treatment was damaged. You have been watching here all the time. If you don&rsquo;t give me a reason, don&rsquo;t blame me for turning over my face mercilessly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the end of the day, the ghost king was in a fierce voice. Mr. ghost could feel a sharp blade of killing on his back without even looking back. However, he did not have the slightest fear. Instead, he pointed to the Fu Long Ding floating in the air in a tired tone and said in a weak voice: &ldquo;Lord. Would you like to see the Fulong Ding first</p>
<p>The ghost king looked up, but he didn&rsquo;t see anything for a moment. The Fulong Ding was still floating in the air, and the surrounding was still red and bloody. Then he said, &ldquo;what do you want me to see? It&rsquo;s not all good&hellip;&rdquo; In the middle of his speech, his voice was stifled for a moment, and he could not speak any more. Then his eyes seemed to be frozen and he was staring at the Dragon tripod in the sky.</p>
<p>In the blood.</p>
<p>Floating in the air on the front of the Fulong Ding, there was a strange white light in the middle of the forehead. It was like a light dagger, which was inserted on the top of the devil&rsquo;s head. However, the red color around the light dagger faded, and the color above the eyes changed to the original color of the Fulong Ding.</p>
<p>The ghost King&rsquo;s face changed greatly. He turned around and said to Mr. ghost, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost uttered a tone and said in a low voice: &ldquo;everything was OK originally. I can see that the four spirit blood array of Fulong Ding is about to be completed. However, at the moment when the array was running until the blood was complete and the Shura gathered, the forbidden system suddenly came out of the Fulong Ding. The ancient Ding&rsquo;s life eye was clasped, and the original blood was forced to disperse. During this period, the power of the blood array Shura did not dare to be bound up and counterattack. Even I was hard to control. But I could not help but suppress this divine law. On the contrary, the power of Shura was forced to vent without any way and ran around in a roundabout way. That&rsquo;s out of control. &quot;</p>
<p>The ghost King took a breath and turned to stare at the seemingly weak beam. After a long time, he said in a low voice: &ldquo;what kind of prohibition is this. How can it be so powerful that it can seal the power of Fulong Ding which can destroy heaven and earth? &quot;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost hesitated for a moment and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure, but it should be a kind of ancient divine law which forbids the lock of heaven and earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaven and earth lock?&rdquo; The ghost King frowned and whispered, &ldquo;Why have you never heard of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost shook his head and said, &ldquo;this kind of divine prohibition has never appeared in the world. Since ancient times, it has been vaguely mentioned on some incomplete capital stocks. No one really believed that there was such a thing in existence. &quot; Speaking of this, Mr. ghost pauses for a moment and looks at the ghost king. He still stares at the thin light dagger in the air, but his face is still very ugly.</p>
<p>Mr. ghost sighed in his heart, and then said, &ldquo;it is said that this prohibition of divine law was used by ancient gods to suppress demons. Only if human beings can find another ancient artifact can there be some hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost King&rsquo;s body trembled slightly, turned around and said, &ldquo;what is the ancient artifact?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost gave a bitter smile and said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even know this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The king of ghosts said angrily, &ldquo;so what we have done for the four spirits blood array is not all our previous achievements?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. GUI was silent for a moment and said slowly: &ldquo;in my opinion, the aura of the blood array around the blood pool has not been dispersed, and the blood is still abundant. Even if the power of Shura in the Fulong Ding is still gathering, it is only a temporary state. It can be seen that the vitality of the four spirit blood array is still there, and it is only half a step away from the completion. The problem is that the sudden appearance of heaven and earth lock has just sealed the Fulong Ding Their own Qi will cut off the aura of the four spirit blood array Fu Long Ding. If the blood and Qi do not go to the Fulong Ding, the power of Shura is difficult to stand out. This is still a dilemma like this. &quot;</p>
<p>The ghost King&rsquo;s face was changing rapidly, and all kinds of facial expressions were changing constantly. However, the fierce air that was gushing out was almost like a shape, which washed to Mr. GUI one wave after another.</p>
<p>Mr. ghost&rsquo;s black veil is still standing in the same place, looking at the ghost king in silence.</p>
<p>After a long time, the ghost king suddenly took a long breath. His face calmed down and even his voice calmed down. He said coldly, &ldquo;what do you think we should do now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost sighed in secret, and said, &ldquo;the most important thing now is the lock of heaven and earth. As long as we solve it, we can succeed in one fell swoop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost king said, &ldquo;what are you going to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost hesitated for a moment and said, &ldquo;if there is an ancient artifact in the legend, it will be the best, but it seems that there is little hope. However, I think that although the Qiankun lock is powerful, it is quite different from those legends left from ancient times. The Fulong Ding is a very ancient thing. I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s not ten thousand years old. Even though the heaven and earth lock is an ancient divine law, its power is incomparable, but if it&rsquo;s wasted for thousands of years, it&rsquo;s going to kill most of it. If you look at it carefully, you may not be able to crack it.</p>
<p>The ghost king was silent for a moment and nodded slowly. The expression on the face also gradually eased down, pondered for a while, seemed to have remembered something, the face turned gloomy. With a long sigh, he said, &ldquo;are they all lives?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost Mr. one Zheng, does not understand its meaning, way: &ldquo;what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost King grinned bitterly, and there was no anger on his face. A little more helpless bitterness, shook his head and said: &ldquo;nothing, now I&rsquo;ll work hard for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without waiting for Mr. ghost&rsquo;s permission, the ghost king turned and left the blood pool. Looking from behind, Mr. ghost saw the big back of the ghost king, but somehow he looked tired and trembling, as if there was a heavy burden on his shoulders.</p>
<p>And he seems to be working harder and harder</p>
<p>GUI Li pushed open the stone gate and returned to his residence. The stone gate closed slowly behind him, making a low voice, and the ghost seemed to feel nothing. His eyes were at a loss, and he didn&rsquo;t even know how he got back here.</p>
<p>There were also cracks all over the four walls of the stone chamber where he lived, ranging from thick to thin, deep to shallow, and occasionally small stones falling down from the rough cracks. It was obvious that there was no escape from the mysterious power in the blood pool deep in the cave of Huqi mountain. But everything seemed to turn a blind eye, and he fell on the bed. The hand completely lost its strength and relaxed. A disc wrapped in black cloth slipped gently from his hand and fell soundlessly on the bed beside his hand.</p>
<p>The gray shadow flashed. Monkey small ash jumped over from the side, jump to the ghost, but only see the ghost, Li is still lying motionless, no response. Xiaohui is a little strange. He looks into the ghost&rsquo;s head and sees that his eyes are closed. His face was pale, and his three eyes blinked. It seemed that he knew something. After two squeaks, he was quiet. He didn&rsquo;t disturb GUI Li any more. He jumped down from Gui Li and sat on the bed with his back against the master&rsquo;s body without saying a word.</p>
<p>In the stone chamber, he fell into a silence. After a long time, he was still as still as before. Xiao Hui looked at his master with some worry, but he seemed hesitant to disturb him. The monkey turned around and suddenly saw something wrapped in black cloth lying on the bed not far away.</p>
<p>Xiao Hui&rsquo;s three eyes blinked, looked for a long time, and then turned his head to see that he was still lying quietly. Xiaohui&rsquo;s tail swayed gently and grabbed his head. Then he leaned forward slightly and quickly stretched out his hand and took the thing in his hand.</p>
<p>Xiaohui turned the black cloth wrapped round things over and looked at it for several times, but he didn&rsquo;t see anything. On the contrary, the monkey&rsquo;s paw was accidentally not grasped firmly. In addition, he was restless in front of him. He just wrapped it with black cloth and relaxed very much. All of a sudden, the black cloth fell off, and a white jade plate slipped out of it. With a &ldquo;slap&rdquo; sound, it fell gently on the bed in front of Xiaohui.</p>
<p>Xiaohui was startled, and his whole body shrank back for a moment. Before meeting, the jade plate was quite strange, emitting a soft white luster. Besides, there were countless small pieces of jade sliding on their own in the center of the jade plate, which was never-ending. It was even more magical.</p>
<p>Xiao Hui&rsquo;s attention was immediately attracted to the past. The three monkeys did not even blink. They kept staring at the samsara plate of heaven and earth, and then carefully stretched out a pair of hands and gently touched the edge of the jade plate.</p>
<p>The Qiankun samsara plate slipped to the side quietly, and Xiaohui&rsquo;s hand was quickly taken back. It looked like a monkey was testing this strange plate, but it seemed that there was no danger. Xiaohui put his hand on the jade plate and looked at it carefully. It was not red, itchy or painful. Grinning for a while, he looked at the jade plate lying on the bed. His head turned around and looked around for a while. Then he reached out and grabbed the heaven and earth samsara plate.</p>
<p>The soft white light spilled from the jade plate, shining on the face of the grey hand hairy monkey. Xiao Hui widened his three eyes and looked at the heaven and earth samsara plate. Countless small jade blocks in the jade plate still glided quietly, just like the passage of time and never-ending.</p>
<p>Slowly, Xiaohui seemed to be fascinated. Her three eyes were getting closer and closer to the jade plate. Her eyes were also staring at the countless strange jade blocks that were sliding constantly. Those small things reflected in its three pupils, which faintly turned into the reflection of countless stars in the sky.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, Xiao Hui&rsquo;s body was askew. Somehow, he left the body and came to the edge of the bed. Without knowing it, Xiaohui suddenly fell off the bed and fell to the ground. &ldquo;Squeak!&rdquo; Xiao Hui immediately gave out a low cry, and then jumped like a spring. Fortunately, it held tightly to the heaven and earth samsara plate, and it did not fall to the ground. Xiao Hui jumps up and looks left and right. Three eyes together turn white eyes, one hand casually grasp the jade plate hanging on the side of the body, the other hand to touch the head, obviously also inexplicable. Ming Ming was still sitting next to the master. Why did he suddenly fall out of bed?</p>
<p>Xiao Hui tilted his head and thought for a long time. At last, he didn&rsquo;t think he had any idea. He didn&rsquo;t feel dejected, but he was lively. It&rsquo;s not decadent for a long time. It looked up at the head of the bed, only to see that the ghost is still the same appearance, no movement, it simply sat down on the ground, and put the Qiankun reincarnation plate in front of him.</p>
<p>In the white brilliance, the magic small jade block in the jade plate is still moving. However, this time, Xiaohui was not attracted and addicted to it as before. Her eyes turned around and suddenly grinned, but she raised her other hand and stretched out a finger. Towards those small jade blocks in the center of the jade plate.</p>
<p>In the soft white light, Xiaohui&rsquo;s finger crept in. Suddenly, it touched one of the small jade blocks. However, these jade blocks seemed to have potential. They were not affected by the pressure of Xiaohui&rsquo;s finger, but they still glided forward without any pause.</p>
<p>Xiao Hui was stunned for a moment. He was not angry, but rather a little happy. It seems to have found something interesting, and the second time he stretched out his hand to press the other side of the small jade block, and as expected, he did not suppress it. It became more and more happy, and squeaked a few times. Then he frequently stretched out his hand and pointed to the small jade block in the jade plate and pressed it, and had a good time.</p>
<p>Under the light white light, Xiaohui looks so happy</p>
<p>Just after pressing it for a long time, she always pressed it like this. Xiao Hui seemed bored and suddenly stretched out her finger. He pressed hard on one side of the jade. This time, his strength was not as light as before, quite a student&rsquo;s place. Xiaohui was a different species and had been following the devil for many years. In fact, his moral conduct was different. Under this pressure, the situation was not the same as before. I saw that the jade block was held down by it. I saw that the jade block still had some signs of struggling under her fingers. She wanted to break free and continue to slide forward. However, Xiaohui was excited and her fingers were more powerful. After several times of struggling, the jade piece finally came to a standstill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poof!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A low, dull sound suddenly rang in the jade plate, but it scared the small ash. In a flash, I saw that this small jade block was stagnant, but the other jade blocks were not static. In a moment, another small jade block glided over and hit this jade block.</p>
<p>It seems that there is nothing wrong with the collision of two jade pieces, but a sudden change occurs. The originally soft white light on the heaven and earth samsara plate lights up in an instant, but the matter is not over. Almost at the same time, &ldquo;poop, poop, poop&hellip;&rdquo; More and more jade blocks stopped sliding, and the white light on the jade plate became more and more bright. Later, it was even ten times brighter than that seen in the cold stone chamber before. It could not be seen at all, just like the sun in the sky falling into this small stone chamber.</p>
<p>Xiaohui was stunned and looked at the jade plate in his hand. Even if he was gifted, he could not bear the dazzling brilliance at the moment. He took a step back and let go of the hand, and the heaven and earth samsara plate &ldquo;pa&rdquo; fell to the ground.</p>
<p>However, the abnormal phenomenon did not disappear with the release of Xiaohui&rsquo;s finger. The dazzling but silent brilliance continued to radiate on the jade plate. Among the numerous brilliant brilliance, mysterious patterns gradually emerged.</p>
<p>Xiao Hui jumped up and hid in the corner of the stone room as if burned by fire. However, he seemed to be curious and kept looking back. On the bed, GUI Li didn&rsquo;t seem to feel the strange changes in the stone chamber behind him. He still lay still.</p>
<p>But the most amazing and unexpected thing actually didn&rsquo;t happen in this cave. In the cave of blood pool, far away from the grotto of the ghost stone chamber, Mr. ghost was sitting on the platform, closed his eyes and thinking hard. Above his head, the Fulong Ding, which was suspended in the air, was still firmly nailed to the tripod by the ancient divine law. Although it was weak, it still existed.</p>
<p>At this time, even Mr. ghost did not notice that the white light beam on the Fulong tripod suddenly changed.</p>
<p>It gradually became bright. With the brightness of the beam, the blood red gas that was still under the eyes of the devil&rsquo;s face was forced back a few minutes and fell on the bridge of the nose. The blood on the devil&rsquo;s face turned. From a distance, it seemed that it was twisted a little bit, and later it appeared more ferocious and angry.</p>
<p>With the passage of time, the light seemed to be awakened in general, more and more bright, like echoing something.</p>
<p>On the platform, Mr. ghost&rsquo;s body moved for a moment. He seemed to feel something, but he was not sure. After a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, he slowly opened his eyes and looked up to the Fulong Ding. (to be continued. )</p>
