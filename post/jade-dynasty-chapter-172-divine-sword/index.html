      <p>In the middle of the air, daoxuan real man&rsquo;s brow was locked, and he faced the beast God in front of him, which was like a devil coming out of the nine hell hell hell. He was not only him, but also all the people in the right path under his feet, and they were all stunned.</p>
<p>The monster in the air was as black as ink, and the muscles of its huge body curled up. I don&rsquo;t know how many thick arms extended from the body. Looking at it roughly, I&rsquo;m afraid that there will be no less than hundreds of them. In addition, the head and face deformed by witchcraft are even more ferocious and terrifying. It is really a monster that has never been seen since the founding of the earth.</p>
<p>After the silence, there was a lot of commotion and noise in the crowd. After that, more and more people had such a sense of certainty. It seemed that these barbarians in southern Xinjiang were indeed extremely vicious. In front of them, they were not like human beings, ghosts, ghosts, monsters or demons. Where are the natural creatures in the world?</p>
<p>In the middle of the sky, immortal daoxuan breathed deeply and slowly laid the ancient sword of Zhuxian across his chest. The dazzling white light constantly flickers from the ancient sword of Zhuxian. Not only does it wrap the ancient sword itself, but also covers the whole right arm of daoxuan immortal holding the sword. From the outside, at the moment, the sky is full of sword shadows, and the sword array is majestic. Immortal daoxuan is more like a fairy. But somehow, under the appearance of his immortals, his face began to pale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Demon,&rdquo; Taoist immortal&rsquo;s voice was like a yellow bell and drum, with a deep tone and a booming voice. Compared with the past, it was a bit more sinister, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you wake up and tie your hands to be captured?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The thousand handed monster who incarnated the God of beasts obviously didn&rsquo;t take the words of real daoxuan seriously. Moreover, after his transformation, his voice changed his peaceful tone and became hoarse and hard to hear, as if it was a broken sand paper sharpening a steel blade. He sneered and said, &ldquo;are you ready to be captured? Hey hey, how about if I strip you alive, and then I&rsquo;ll take these wastes under my feet one by one, and send them to the hell to meet with you? &quot;</p>
<p>The evil spirit flashed between daoxuan&rsquo;s eyebrows. What&rsquo;s more, the sword formula leads to the sky full of sword Qi, and Zhuxian sword array has been launched again. The monster was arrogant. However, facing the sword array which is only seen in the past thousand years, I dare not be careless and concentrate on each other.</p>
<p>But hear the clang sound of the golden drum, from far to near, roaring.</p>
<p>From the ancient sword Zhuxian, the seven colored awns galloped up and directly into the sky sword array. At that time, the light was shining all over the sky, and the sword shadow was vertical and horizontal. In a twinkling of an eye, they had condensed into seven huge monochromatic sword arrays, just like before, facing the monster incarnated by the beast God.</p>
<p>There was a deep roar from the beast God&rsquo;s mouth. Black air flowed on the surface of the huge body, almost like ink. Hundreds of strange hands were opened or closed. Facing the coming storm.</p>
<p>The immortal daoxuan roared like a Mountain Eagle rising to the sky and soaring into the sky. At the sound of the roar, the white light soared, and the killing immortal swayed. The huge Zhuxian sword array roared, and countless monochromatic air swords slowly turned their heads and aimed at the beast God.</p>
<p>A moment later, in the still sky. Once again, there was a sound of &ldquo;whoosh&rdquo; breaking the sky, and then all the sky was covered with the sound of piercing the sky, and countless sword of killing immortals passed through the sky one after another. With incomparable evil spirit and killing intention, he rushed to the beast God. In a twinkling of an eye, the first wave of purple air sword array had already rushed to the front.</p>
<p>The huge body of the beast God is about to become the living target of countless Qi swords. Just before the countless righteous disciples on Qingyun Mountain were about to cheer, hundreds of strange hands and long arms on the beast God&rsquo;s body were flying, and each arm was full of strong black gas. It looked like a huge black cloud and rose up to the sky.</p>
<p>In an instant, hundreds of Qi swords were stabbed by them, while the beast God&rsquo;s hundreds of strange hands danced like ghosts in the air. Facing these seemingly invincible Zhuxian Qi swords, these black hands were not afraid at all. In a flash, the first wave of purple air swords, either catching or beating, or wrapping or unloading, actually picked up all the air swords. In the black air, those Qi swords soon lost their color and quickly disappeared.</p>
<p>Countless people are dumbfounded. For thousands of years, this is the first person who can face to face with Zhuxian sword array!</p>
<p>However, there is no more time for people to think about these superfluous things in the changing situation. For example, there are more and more stingy swords separated from the huge colorful main sword in the sky. Under the control of the ancient sword Zhuxian and daoxuan immortal, more and more Qi swords have turned into endless swords. Each Qi sword is full of evil spirit and awe inspiring Shengwei, wave by wave, such as thunder, like lightning, to the beast God.</p>
<p>The beast God roared up to the sky, and the huge voice reverberated in the sky. At the moment, he seemed to be facing the gods in the sky and fighting against the sky.</p>
<p>A thousand hands and a hundred arms, waving in the wind and cloud, black gas billows, layers upon layers, should face the sound of sharp roar all over the sky!</p>
<p>One wave after another, thousands and thousands of Qi swords seemed to descend endlessly. However, the giant body of the beast God seemed to be the incarnation of a demon. At that moment, the two figures who had reached the peak of Taoism in the world ran into each other madly at the top of Qingyun Mountain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that the manpower will run out sometimes</p>
<p>One wave, another wave!</p>
<p>Until the 49th wave of square array air sword roared down, the whole seven color sword array had bombed seven times in turn. Standing at the top of the wind and cloud, the real man daoxuan was so white that even his right hand, which was holding the ancient sword to kill the immortal, was wrapped in the white light, and even faintly trembled.</p>
<p>In front of him, the appearance of the beast God is even more in a mess. After the baptism of the wild sword array like a storm, more than half of the original majestic strange arms have been destroyed. At the moment, the black air of the whole body is much thinner. However, when he received the last wave of Qi sword, the ferocious color on his face was stronger, but his fighting spirit was still higher. A hoarse strange smile, like the low roar of evil spirits, broke out.</p>
<p>At the moment, the crowd was silent, and everyone was pale. Just now, the thrilling and perfect fighting method made everyone dazzled and couldn&rsquo;t help themselves, but unexpectedly, the immortal sword array seemed to have returned. Why not the immortal beast in front of us? Can&rsquo;t we avoid this catastrophe?</p>
<p>The animal God looked up and laughed. Suddenly, his huge body suddenly rose into the air and rushed to the Taoist immortal. Suddenly, there was a cry of surprise in the sky and the ground. Only daoxuan immortal, startled but not confused, took a deep breath and drank softly. The water Unicorn at the foot of the horse has become spiritually enlightened, and immediately retreats.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, although the animal God&rsquo;s body was very large, it was as fast as lightning, and in a twinkling of an eye he had already rushed to his eyes. At that time, however, seeing the black air surging, I don&rsquo;t know how many huge arms grabbed it.</p>
<p>At this critical juncture, the sword of immortal daoxuan suddenly hung upside down. A pale face instantly turned red, but returned to pale, so fast repeated three times. The ancient sword killed the immortals. It was like a long whale absorbing water. In an instant, it sucked down countless air swords in the sky, and laid it in front of the Taoist immortal, making a group of colorful sword walls.</p>
<p>The beast God&rsquo;s face changed greatly, but it was not enough to stop his hand. However, he heard the voice of &ldquo;servant servant&rdquo; and &ldquo;Lakka&rdquo; in the sky. Suddenly, the black air was scattered, and I don&rsquo;t know how many strange hands disappeared.</p>
<p>Seeing the Taoist immortal turn from danger to safety, he even more severely damaged the animal God. At the top of Qingyun Mountain, countless disciples were in a state of great surprise and joy. Unexpectedly, before they could stop cheering, they could see that there was still one of the strongest black arms among the bright sword walls. However, there was still the strongest black arm. The black air was especially strong. It forced them to pass through and hit immortal daoxuan&rsquo;s chest with one hand.</p>
<p>The Taoist immortal was struck by lightning, and his body was shocked, and the unicorn roared up to the sky with his feet in the water. One man and one beast all flew back, flying straight to ten feet, and then stopped. And the people at the foot can see clearly that this is on the way back. The dark green Taoist robe of immortal daoxuan was smashed in an instant, and the red blood gushed out from his mouth, which seemed to fall on the ancient sword to kill the immortal. The dark red light was dotted in the white light, and then it gradually disappeared.</p>
<p>Heaven and earth. A moment of silence.</p>
<p>The sword array of killing immortals in the sky seems to have been affected. It sways and shakes, and the sword shadow is turbulent all over the sky, but finally it is still. I just don&rsquo;t know if it is because of the damage of the true dharma. The coverage of the originally overwhelming Zhuxian sword array has been reduced by more than half at the moment.</p>
<p>An ominous foreboding seems to be enveloped in everyone&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<p>Wipe off the bloodstain from the corner of his mouth. Immortal daoxuan looked at the palm of his hand, and the red blood was flowing on his palm. He looked at his hands for a long time, and then slowly looked forward. At the moment, the dark clouds of the sword were all dissipated, and the beast God in front of him was staring at him with a tiger&rsquo;s eye. However, although the beast God hurt himself, his own situation was not much better.</p>
<p>About half of the original strange hands were once again severely damaged in an instant, and most of them were killed by immortals. Now, there are only dozens left, but the rest are the most powerful arms, which are quite different from ordinary ones. The beast God&rsquo;s face, originally covered with black air, seems to be a little pale at the moment. However, his fighting spirit on his face is like the fiercest beast. He is more frustrated and has no intention of giving up at all.</p>
<p>Daoxuan&rsquo;s mouth twitched for a moment, as if in a bitter smile, but this slight movement, as if also affected the injury, the body was shaking a few times, causing countless people under the feet to scream out. But fortunately, he only shook a few times, and then stood firm, but now his weakness is obvious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;KaKa&rdquo; sneered and said in a low voice: &ldquo;how, like you ignorant human beings, even if there are such supernatural creatures to help, it is not a common end, you should kill yourself as soon as possible!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The immortal daoxuan raised his head in silence and looked up to the sky. The light of the ancient sword of killing immortals reflected his face and suddenly had a strange look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ancestors of Qingyun gate&hellip;&rdquo; Immortal daoxuan suddenly opened his mouth, but the tone of his voice was low and slightly painful. He said, &ldquo;disciple daoxuan is not good, and he is unable to subdue the demons of different ways, involving all living beings. A catastrophe will come. For the sake of the common people, I have no choice but to disobey the patriarch&rsquo;s prohibition. I hope that the grandmaster will protect me, kill demons and subdue demons. In the future, even if the disciples are doomed, they are willing to bear the responsibility. &quot;</p>
<p>His voice was so low that few people could hear him. But when they saw that he was saying something, his face seemed to be a little painful. For a moment, they were confused and did not know what xuanzhenren was doing. Just a moment later, in the middle of the sky, immortal daoxuan locked his eyebrows with awe and awe. Suddenly, he drew the sword formula of his left hand and ran straight to the ancient sword of Zhuxian.</p>
<p>The white light flashed, and the red light flickered. The left hand of daoxuan was inserted into the white light, and when he came out, it was blood. However, although his face was pale, there was no trace of pain. His left hand was scurrying, and a strange pattern was quickly drawn in the void. However, the blood drops dropped from his fingers did not fall down. Instead, he waved his hand and condensed into the air The case came to light.</p>
<p>A bright red, blood Tai Chi pattern!</p>
<p>The red blood quickly began to flow on the Tai Chi diagram, becoming more and more bright, almost like ruby, and the Taiji diagram itself began to rotate rapidly. Daoxuan&rsquo;s face became more and more pale. At the same time, the ancient sword Zhuxian wrapped in the white light at his hand began to vibrate slightly, as if something in this legendary magic sword was stirred up and longed for!</p>
<p>The Taiji diagram turns faster and faster. He rose slowly to three feet in front of immortal daoxuan. At the moment, he was very pale, as if his whole body&rsquo;s true strength had been absorbed by the Tai Chi diagram, but he still exhausted his last strength. When he mentions the ancient sword to kill the immortal, he suddenly stabs it with great force. A sword runs through the blood Taiji pattern. At the same time, he drinks in his mouth: &ldquo;God Machine Seal!&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>Every time he drank a word, there was no storm in the blue sky, accompanied by a thunder, earth shaking, awe inspiring force. From the top, it seems to be invisible.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the gale, &ldquo;bang, bang, bang&rdquo; was like an explosion. With the sound of his drink, he heard three times, and his clothes burst open and turned into ashes.</p>
<p>At his feet, above the vast land, the huge Qingyun mountains rumbled. The earth began to tremble slightly. The seven peaks of Qingyun Mountain towering into the sky, dragon head, Chaoyang, sunset, Fenghui, Dazhu and Xiaozhu have seven veins. Green mountains and deep valleys, among the majestic rocks, are actually showing golden light, becoming stronger and brighter, and gradually converging into shape. The golden light seems to be projected from the depths of the spiritual peaks of mountains. It is also like that many mountains have their own life. In the golden eyes, the huge mountains breathe slowly.</p>
<p>In the flickering and dazzling golden light, seven kinds of huge gold patterns are finally gathered together. On the mountain top of the earth, the ancient sword above the sky is far away to kill the immortal.</p>
<p>Shine in the sky!</p>
<p>Brilliant!</p>
<p>Even the beast God is shocked by it!</p>
<p>The ancient sword of Zhuxian vibrates more and more fiercely, and the Taiji diagram formed by blood that it runs through has been spinning rapidly and can&rsquo;t be seen clearly.</p>
<p>The gold and green on daoxuan&rsquo;s face flashed, and suddenly his eyes burst into a big drink.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Broken!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The word &ldquo;broken&rdquo; sounds out. In an instant, however, you can see that the sword shadow is swaying in the sky. The vast sky is full of darkness. The wind blows and rocks move, and the rocks fall one after another. The original solemn and magnificent golden pattern of seven veins seems to be torn by some Juli Shengsheng and begins to disperse gradually.</p>
<p>Almost at the same time, the light on the ancient sword Zhuxian became more and more intense, and the white light was dazzling. Even the whole figure of daoxuan immortal was wrapped in it. In this exciting scene, the original seven color light from the seven pulse mountain suddenly disappeared. At the same time, the shadows of swords all over the sky are gradually fading away. Only the colorful main sword in Zhuxian sword array is more and more dazzling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boom!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A thunder, resounding through the heaven and earth, the earth shakes even more fiercely. The golden halo on the seven pulse peak has reached the final moment, and finally, completely disappeared.</p>
<p>The thunder, like the tide, reverberated in the sky, but suddenly the earth was quiet, no longer shaking, no longer splitting. Then, almost at the same time, more than ten times stronger than before, all kinds of different lights rumbled up and soared to the sky, once again converged on the ancient sword to kill the immortal.</p>
<p>The blazing brilliance was like an explosion, shining on the world in all directions, and the incredible light covered the whole world. Above the ancient sword array, only the huge colorful main sword was left. But at this moment, the magnificent light reflected from the ancient sword killing immortal, bit by bit, in the eyes of thousands of people, the colorful sword of killing immortals was from the flowing light The splendor gradually merged, and gradually became a single color, blazing white sword, shining brilliantly in the world.</p>
<p>In a flash, countless people woke up from the fright and looked at the incredible scene in the sky. All the people were intoxicated with it, and the crazy cheers came and went one after another, filling the top of Qingyun Mountain.</p>
<p>Everyone suddenly recovered from despair, and suddenly seemed to be full of self-confidence. It turns out that the world is really evil, regardless of whether the fight is still not over, and the outcome is unknown.</p>
<p>However, in such a crazy crowd, everyone looked up at the sky, and no one would notice that in the midst of the madness, a white figure quietly left the crowd and quickly drifted back to the mountain.</p>
<p>Wind blowing cheek, as if there is a trace of cold, but how to cover up, deep in the heart of that burning blazing flame?</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s snow-white face, faint faint faint blush, tightly biting her lips, a pair of eyes deep in the eyes, has been to the deep back of the mountain!</p>
<p>At the edge of the sky, the wind and cloud are in a hurry!</p>
<p>But who cares?</p>
<p>You you ancient songs, low heart language, with the white clothes floating, with the wind away, to the unknown distance. (to be continued. )</p>
