      <p>At the moment of sneezing, Bai Xiaochun also woke up, and his consciousness was still immersed in the serious injury state before coma. As soon as he woke up, he subconsciously held his left arm and screamed, but the scream stopped suddenly. He looked down at his left arm in surprise, looked at his body, touched here, touched there, and even lifted his clothes to see himself White and tender stomach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why? Why is there no wound? &quot; Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s eyes were full of fear. He thought of the old man in the village that if a person died, his soul would enter the hell. Now he has no wound on his body. It is clear that he has only soul left He looked around shivering, and found that the place was deserted, the grass and trees on the ground withered, and Chen Heng&rsquo;s body disappeared.</p>
<p>When you look at the distance, there is fog all around, only a few areas can be seen, and the far place is indistinct. The breath of death fills the air and makes people feel cold all over the body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s over I&rsquo;ve been safe for a small part of my life, and I&rsquo;ve lost my life this time&hellip; &quot; Bai Xiaochun is more certain. The whole person is a little bit out of his wits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t given Du Lingfei a chance to reciprocate Senior brother Hou also made a promise to me No one knows that I am the tortoise. I still have enough Lingwei chicken. I I haven&rsquo;t had a long life yet&hellip; &quot; The more she thought about it, the more sad she was. Her tears were in her eyes.</p>
<p>But when he was howling with grief, suddenly A cough came from behind him.</p>
<p>The cough was so abrupt that she startled Bai Xiaochun. Bai Xiaochun suddenly climbed forward and turned around with a wooden sword in her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun shrieked and saw the position in front of him. There was an old man in a black robe standing there like a zombie. Now he was looking at himself.</p>
<p>Death was particularly obvious on him, especially the old man&rsquo;s face was pale and wrinkled, as if he had crawled out of the tomb, and with the strange surrounding, he looked very sinister.</p>
<p>After seeing it clearly, Bai Xiaochun felt that his sweat pores suddenly stood up, and countless legends about ghosts and ghosts asking for their lives appeared in his mind. But soon he thought that he was dead, so he immediately calmed down, raised his chin and snorted, and finally stood up from the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you are a ghost, and I am a ghost. Anyway, I am dead. Everyone is a ghost. Who is afraid of whom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun goes to the old man and turns around the old man in black, Zizi has a sound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are the ghost of this nameless mountain. Don&rsquo;t be nervous. I just died here by accident when I was passing by. I left soon. Alas, I don&rsquo;t know if I can continue to practice and become a immortal ghost after becoming a ghost.&rdquo; When Bai Xiaochun said this, she felt sad again and sighed.</p>
<p>The old man in black frowns and looks at Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s hoarse mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want to die so much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun was stunned. He suddenly seemed to think of something. He bit the tip of his tongue fiercely. When the pain came, Bai Xiaochun couldn&rsquo;t believe it and bit it again. This time, tears of pain were flowing down. He looked ecstatic, dancing and roaring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not dead!&rdquo;!!! Ha ha, I&rsquo;m white Xiaochun. I&rsquo;m invincible. How can I die? &quot; Bai Xiaochun grabs the arm of the old man in front of him excitedly, but his hand penetrates the other party&rsquo;s body instantly and grabs the air. Even when he touches the old man, he also feels a strong chill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Er&hellip;&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s body was stiff. He looked up at the old man in front of him. His eyes were dilated, and he screamed bitterly. His body suddenly retreated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ghost!&rdquo; Just now he thought he was dead, so it didn&rsquo;t matter, but this time he was really scared. The stories of ghosts and killing in his mind were rolling out more and more.</p>
<p>When he retreated to the edge of the fog, there was a layer of invisible diaphragm, which made Bai Xiaochun unable to rush out. He leaned against the diaphragm, holding a small wooden sword tremblingly. His eyes were wide open, and his mind was spinning rapidly. Finally, he looked at the old man in black with pity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grandfather, if you have any unfinished wish, I&rsquo;ll help you complete it&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man in black looks strange. After a careful look at Bai Xiaochun, he feels that he is not alone with the scene of iron and blood he has seen before, and gradually reveals his meditation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps, only people with this kind of character are most suitable to practice the immortal longevity work&hellip;&rdquo; The old man murmured softly, relieved at the bottom of his heart, shook his head and laughed, turned and drifted towards the distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Immortality and immortality can be divided into immortality volume and immortality volume, among which there are five volumes of immortality and five volumes of immortality What you practice is the most popular Volume I of immortality, immortality skin. Now the iron sheet is big and the copper sheet is small! &quot; The black robed old man gradually walked away, but his voice floated, echoing in Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Immortal volume, break through the five shackles of life, longevity volume, break the five seals of eternity!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Practice well. If you can reach the level of immortality, you can touch the first layer of shackles of life. Whether you can break through the shackles depends on your nature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s predestined to meet you. I&rsquo;ll give you a pill to make a breakthrough in the skin of immortality. When the copper skin is Dacheng, I&rsquo;ll give you a jade slip, which records immortality The second volume, the Immortal King Kong!</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t die and live forever. This skill Extraordinary The old man had gone far away and could not see his figure clearly. However, with the sound shaking, two long rainbow came in an instant and floated in front of Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun was shocked, staring at the back of the old man&rsquo;s leaving. At this time, he fully understood that the reason why he was not dead and the injury recovered was that the other party saved everything.</p>
<p>And the reason It&rsquo;s the immortality of self-cultivation.</p>
<p>Although Bai Xiaochun was afraid of death, he was very grateful for his kindness. He knew that he had been injured and almost died. At the moment, his body was shaking. He took a deep breath and knelt down to the place where the old man left.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you for saving your life and transmitting meritorious service. Please tell me the taboo&hellip;&rdquo; Exclaimed Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old man The tomb keeper. &quot; The old man has been integrated into the world, his voice is weak, with vicissitudes, with reminiscence, as if from countless years ago, if not.</p>
<p>In the distance, the pure air is broken, and the small air is blowing away from the pure space.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Immortality and longevity Five shackles of life and five seals of eternity He murmured, something he had never heard of before.</p>
<p>After a long time, Bai Xiaochun took a deep breath and looked at the pills and jade slips floating in front of her. She took the jade slips in her hand and swept her divine sense. What was recorded in it was the content of the second volume of immortality.</p>
<p>After putting away the jade slips, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s eyes fell on the pill. Although he became a medicine apprentice, he could not recognize the grade of the pill. He took it in his hand and looked at it carefully. He was cautious, and his eyes showed thinking. He knew that if the black robed elder wanted to harm himself, there were too many ways. So this pill was only good for him, not harmful.</p>
<p>In his meditation, he looked around, put away the pill, and walked out in a flash. He looked at the jungle all the way around. He looked with emotion. Recalling the fierce battle with the Luochen family before, he was still in fear of the danger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what happened to elder martial sister Du and elder martial brother hou Did you escape&hellip; &quot; When Bai Xiaochun was meditating, he did not take out the jade slips and try to contact him. He was worried that once the Luochen family was not destroyed, the fluctuation of the jade slips might cause some trouble. At the moment, he touched the storage bag and took out Feng Yan&rsquo;s popular boat. As soon as he put it into practice, he immediately found that the boat could be used.</p>
<p>He had a good look in his eyes and a guess in his heart, but he didn&rsquo;t worry to leave. He found a cave in this mountain range, took out the turtle pattern pot, and refined the pills given by the old man in black robe.</p>
<p>Soon, the silver light of the pill flickered, and there were three holy lines on it. Bai Xiaochun held the pill, and his eyes showed determination and swallowed it. At the moment of swallowing, his body roared. If a fire suddenly broke out, it turned into an indescribable vitality and spread rapidly towards the whole body.</p>
<p>His body trembled, gritted his teeth and insisted on it. He beat his body. Gradually, his whole skin was no longer black, but a copper color. The copper color became heavier and heavier. At the end of the day, he almost became a bronze man.</p>
<p>The power in his body suddenly increased, and a strong feeling continued to set off in his heart.</p>
<p>However, the effect did not end. After being refined by Bai Xiaochun for three times, the pill seemed to have reached an amazing quality. When Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s skin was completely copper, his whole body suddenly trembled, and there was a click in his ear. It seemed that something was broken.</p>
<p>At this moment, there were cracks in his skin. The cracks were more and more. When they covered the whole body, the pain was more intense. But with the patience of Bai Xiaochun, slowly, there was silver light in those cracks!</p>
<p>Undead skin, divided into iron, copper, silver, gold four levels!</p>
<p>Even the old man in black could not have foreseen that the pill he gave Bai Xiaochun was driven by Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s Alchemy. After breaking through the copper skin, he actually broke through again.</p>
<p>The sound of roar reverberated in Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s body for several days. His skin broke more and more. In the end, like molting, he began to fall off. Every time a piece fell, the exposed skin was silver.</p>
<p>Ten days later, when the last piece of broken skin on Bai Xiaochun fell off, his whole body was shining with silver light. Although it was only light silver, when he opened his eyes, even in his eyes there was a flash of silver.</p>
<p>When the body is shaking, the speed is so fast that it makes an amazing sound of breaking the air directly. It is obviously faster than before, at least twice faster!</p>
<p>White small pure eyes revealed ecstasy, his right hand clenched his fist, toward the side of the rock, roaring, that rock instantly collapsed, not into pieces, but into powder!</p>
<p>This power is as great as before.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun was excited. He took a deep breath. At this moment, he was confident that if he fought with Chen Heng again, he would never be so miserable.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more amazing in his attempt is his degree of protection and his immortal silver skin, which makes the wooden sword that has been practiced for three times can&rsquo;t hurt him at all.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun is excited. After watching her whole body do not work, she returns to her white and pure appearance, changes her clothes again, and unfolds at full speed towards the distance and goes away with pride.</p>
