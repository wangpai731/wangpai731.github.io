      <p>At the same time, there is a huge underground palace at the bottom of the house where the Luochen family is located. There is a blood lake where countless bones are soaked.</p>
<p>There is a shining array around. Countless people of the Luochen family are kneeling around one by one. Men and women, old and young, are densely packed. The kneeling place of each clan is a node of this array.</p>
<p>Each of them was silent. Their right hand was cut open, and the blood fell down. They integrated into the nodes around them, and gathered the blood of all the people of the whole clan into the blood Lake in the center.</p>
<p>In the center of the lake, there is an old man who meditates with his knees crossed. The old man is white haired, but he is not angry. At the moment, every breath he takes in meditation, the blood lake is boiling.</p>
<p>At this time, the old man&rsquo;s eyes suddenly opened, showing a touch of blood light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; His bleak voice echoed in the underground palace.</p>
<p>One of the people nearest him spoke in a low voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Laozu, there are three disciples from outside the Lingxi sect. They came so suddenly that I was unprepared. I was worried that it would affect our family&rsquo;s affairs. As a puppet outside, I planned to use the array to cooperate with other puppets to kill the three. Unfortunately The younger generation was incompetent. He killed only one person and let the other two escape. As for the disciple who was captured before, he was also It&rsquo;s gone. &quot; The young man was the man whom Bai Xiaochun saw fighting with them.</p>
<p>He is also depressed at the bottom of his heart. It usually takes at least half a year for a disciple of Lingxi sect to be found missing. Only then will he arrange for his disciples to explore. In this way, it usually takes about nine months to get to the Luoxing mountains.</p>
<p>But now only four months have passed, and a disciple of Lingxi sect has arrived. Let alone him, the whole Luochen family didn&rsquo;t expect it. After all, he was only a foreign disciple, and their family had not shown any signs before. According to the truth, it is impossible to be so fast.</p>
<p>As for Hou Yunfei, if it was not for finding out the secret of their Luochen family, they would not have caught it. Originally, according to their plan, it would only take six months to complete. Once completed, the family would be able to get rid of the control of Lingxi clan!</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s still a month away</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two outside disciples Hum, I&rsquo;ve opened the array and sealed all directions. You&rsquo;ll send someone to kill them as soon as possible. As long as it&rsquo;s another month That&rsquo;s enough! &quot; The old man opened his mouth lightly, but he didn&rsquo;t put it in his heart and closed his eyes again.</p>
<p>The young man took a deep breath and bowed his head and said yes.</p>
<p>After a while, seven figures came out of the house of the Luochen family. It was the young man who was the first one. At the moment, his real cultivation was revealed, which was the appearance of eight layers of condensation gas.</p>
<p>The other six people, the weakest is the sixth layer of condensate, and two are the seventh layer of condensate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They can&rsquo;t escape far, chase!&rdquo; Seven people&rsquo;s bodies shake, one by one in the eyes show the intention of killing, straight to the jungle.</p>
<p>In the jungle, Bai Xiaochun and Du Lingfei hold the comatose Hou Yunfei and gallop forward. He also tries to take out the flying boat. However, the formation here not only blocks the transmission of information, but also prevents the boat from running.</p>
<p>This scene makes Bai Xiaochun and Du Lingfei look even worse.</p>
<p>Silent all the way, they hold Hou Yunfei&rsquo;s teeth and gallop.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun is pale, and his sense of crisis has reached the extreme. Every inch of his body is screaming, and even seems to be delivering a strong appeal to him, telling him to flee quickly!</p>
<p>If you slow down a little bit, you&rsquo;ll die here!</p>
<p>This crisis of death is countless times stronger than that brought by Feng Yan. After all, even if Feng Yan wants to attack him, he has scruples and needs to be killed in secret.</p>
<p>As long as he is alert, although he can not avoid all of them, he can avoid most of them and even find opportunities to fight back.</p>
<p>But now As soon as Bai Xiaochun thought of the news that he and others had mastered, his heart was shaking and his forehead was constantly sweating. This kind of news about the rebellion of a Xiuzhen family, let alone the Luochen family, would not hesitate to kill him here.</p>
<p>The other side must be at all costs, but also their own and other people completely shut up.</p>
<p>It won&rsquo;t be a secret shot, but a direct killing like thunder.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s impossible to even give them time to escape too far. Maybe the people of the Luochen family are chasing after them in the rear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn law enforcement hall, this task It&rsquo;s not a task that can be accepted by other disciples at all! &quot; At the thought of the Luochen family and the existence of Zhuji ancestors, Bai Xiaochun is even more shivering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Building foundation The comparison between condensate and strong foundation builders is like the gap between ordinary people and condensate&hellip; &quot; Bai Xiaochun is short of breath and her eyes are red.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I practice It&rsquo;s for longevity&hellip; &quot; Bai Xiaochun wants to cry without tears. He looks at Hou Yunfei. He can&rsquo;t throw Hou Yunfei down for speed. He can&rsquo;t do this kind of thing.</p>
<p>Du Lingfei looks pale. Her accomplishments are the weakest, and her aura can&rsquo;t recover. At the moment, she feels bitter. She knows that this time she will die, and there is a great possibility that she will die ten times without life. If Feng Yan is there, it will be fine. After all, with her cultivation of seven layers of condensing Qi, only the founder of the other party doesn&rsquo;t show up. Maybe there is still a lot of strength.</p>
<p>But now Feng Yan is dead. She has only five layers of condensing gas, and she can&rsquo;t break through. Bai Xiaochun Du Lingfei has no hope for him who is afraid of death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect to die here the first time I went out on a mission.&rdquo; Du Lingfei laughed bitterly, but she bit her silver teeth. Before the end, she would never give up her vitality. At the moment, she patted the storage bag, took out the pill and swallowed it. She looked at Bai Xiaochun, who was pale and trembling. Du Lingfei sighed. At this time, she did not have any contempt for Bai Xiaochun. She took out a Dan bottle and threw it to Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Younger martial brother Bai, pay attention to replenish the aura in your body at any time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun is stunned. He takes the medicine bottle, opens it in silence and swallows one. He seems to think of something. He takes out two pills from Feng Yan&rsquo;s storage bag.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elder martial brother Feng, there are also pills here.&rdquo; He said, giving Du Lingfei half.</p>
<p>Du Lingfei takes over in silence. The two speed unchanged and gallop again. Gradually, they come to the place where they found the jade slips of Hou Yunfei. Looking at the big tree, Du Lingfei sighs deeply.</p>
<p>But at the moment, regret is useless. They help Hou Yunfei to run again. Gradually, Du Lingfei&rsquo;s speed becomes slower and slower. Bai Xiaochun is worried. She takes Du Lingfei&rsquo;s arm and runs with Hou Yunfei.</p>
<p>Du Lingfei has long found that Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s speed is always fast here. When she is caught by him, she will struggle subconsciously. She can see Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s pale face and the fear in her eyes. With a sigh in her heart, she lets Bai Xiaochun grab her arm and rush out together.</p>
<p>At this time, Hou Yunfei&rsquo;s body trembled, slowly opened his eyes, eyes showing fatigue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Younger martial brother Bai, I don&rsquo;t want to leave for several years. You and I met here.&rdquo; Hou Yunfei smiles bitterly and looks at Bai Xiaochun and Du Lingfei who are holding on to him.</p>
<p>Du Lingfei saw Hou Yunfei wake up and quickly took out the pill and handed it to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elder martial brother hou&hellip;&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun looks at Hou Yunfei and sighs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We still have hope. The Luochen family slaughtered the common customs for their own self-interest and exchanged bones for blood. The founder of the foundation, who wanted to preside over the blood rebellion, couldn&rsquo;t chase after him. Moreover, the whole Luochen family is now in the array, so There won&rsquo;t be too many people coming! &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Although there is no way to send information to the clan, as long as you escape from a certain range, you can!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this kind of event, the rebellion of a Xiuzhen family, as long as the clan knows, will come as quickly as possible!&rdquo; Hou Yunfei smiles and takes the pill from Du Lingfei. After swallowing it, the essence in his eyes twinkles. Instead of being supported by Bai Xiaochun, he bites his teeth and runs with them.</p>
<p>In this way, the three speed faster, and gradually saw the edge of the falling star mountain range. Soon after, the three people rushed out. Du Lingfei immediately took out the jade slips and tried to contact zongmen, but her face was paler and she shook her head bitterly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still not&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s heart thump, Hou Yunfei is silent.</p>
<p>The three men did not speak, and they continued to move forward, but at this time, all of a sudden, there was a whistling sound behind them. At the moment of their facial changes, seven figures suddenly rushed out in another direction of the jungle in the whoosh sound.</p>
<p>When the first one was the young man with eight layers of condensate gas, he saw the three people of Bai Xiaochun at a glance, and the opportunity to kill him flashed in his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I said before, you Can&rsquo;t escape! Remember, the man who killed you is Chen Yue</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kill them!&rdquo; All the people of the Luochen family took out their magic weapons, and suddenly rushed to them.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s face color changed greatly, and their teeth biting speed increased.</p>
<p>Chen Yue sneers. As soon as the big sleeve is swung, a purple skull appears immediately. It grows up in the wind and turns into half a foot in size. It gives out a loud laugh and goes straight to Bai Xiaochun. The speed is so fast that when Chen Yueyao points to him, he collapses and explodes on his own.</p>
<p>The sound of a bang formed a shock, which directly separated the three people. Du Lingfei and Hou Yunfei were suddenly blocked and stopped, and they were immediately caught up and surrounded by the people of the Luochen family.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun was originally very fast. He had to take Du and Hou with him. After he dispersed, he didn&rsquo;t think much about it. The speed naturally spread out with all his strength. The wind was howling, and he suddenly increased a lot. Before the people of the Luochen family could surround him, he rushed out in a flash. At the moment, he had already run dozens of feet away. It seems that the speed is still increasing.</p>
<p>With such a rapid increase in his speed, both Chen Yue, a member of the eight layers of condensate gas and other members of the Luochen family, were stunned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Run fast, kill these two first, and then go after this man!&rdquo; Chen Yue light mouth, wave, kill the sky, straight to Du, Hou two people.</p>
<p>During the roar, Du Lingfei spurted blood and barely supported. Her whole body was covered with blood and was surrounded by several people. She knew that she was bound to die. Looking at Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s far away back, she laughed bitterly.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun is afraid of death. She has known for a long time that although it is hard to avoid complexity in her heart, there is more bitterness and despair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Younger martial brother Bai, I hope you can escape&hellip;&rdquo; Du Lingfei pinches the formula, the flying sword roars away, with the speed of lifting the weight as light as possible, and again confronts with the people around her. The blood spurts out again, and her body is already on the verge of falling.</p>
<p>Hou Yunfei also laughed miserably, and his eyes showed the essence. He roared. Even though his aura was almost exhausted at the moment, he was still not ready to give up. Even if he was ready to die, he would try to pull several people of the other party to die together, and fight for more time for Bai Xiaochun.</p>
