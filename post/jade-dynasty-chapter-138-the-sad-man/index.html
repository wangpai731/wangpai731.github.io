      <p>Huqishan, the general Hall of ghost king.</p>
<p>It has been three days since the great wizard died. Qinglong has cremated the old man&rsquo;s body and collected it in an urn of ashes. At the moment, the small blue and white urn was quietly placed on the table beside him.</p>
<p>Qinglong gazed at the urn for a long time, sighed and turned away. In the past three days, Qinglong and Youji have been responsible for all the affairs in the ghost King&rsquo;s clan. After the incident three days ago, the ghost king and GUI Li all shrank into their own rooms and have not yet come out.</p>
<p>Qinglong still clearly remembers that three days ago, when the heavy stone gate opened slowly, the two men who came out of it, and the two men who looked at the world almost fearless, were as if they had lost their souls. They were in a trance and sad.</p>
<p>Ghost king is OK, low said a: &ldquo;in three days, no one to disturb me!&rdquo; As soon as he finished speaking, he went straight back to his bedroom and never came out again.</p>
<p>As for the ghost, the whole person was out of his wits. Without saying a word, he even ran into the hard stone wall directly, which made his forehead bleed with blood. And he, as unconscious as he was, slowly turned around and walked back to his room with a slight stagger at his feet.</p>
<p>Most of the people who were shocked by the strange scene had already guessed the result, but when they looked at the stone gate, there was blood flowing all over the ground, and the great wizard who was sitting in the pool of blood but had already dropped his head and died. The scene was really shocking.</p>
<p>Only Biyao, who is still lying on the cold stone platform, is still as quiet as ever in her serene and lifelike face, and the Acacia bell in her hand is emitting a light golden light.</p>
<p>The sound of footsteps interrupted Qinglong&rsquo;s thoughts. He raised his head and saw the shadow of Youji floating in like a ghost. Standing beside him, he did not look at him directly. Instead, he glanced at the room behind him and whispered, &ldquo;hasn&rsquo;t the Lord come out yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Qinglong slowly shook his head and said in a low voice, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s been three days. There&rsquo;s no news at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The black yarn on Youji&rsquo;s face moves gently. Silent.</p>
<p>Although they didn&rsquo;t see everything with their own eyes, they could imagine the desolation of the scene.</p>
<p>If there is anything more heartbreaking than despair in this world, it is that when you see hope, even when it is in front of you, you fall into despair again!</p>
<p>Just when they were relatively speechless. Suddenly, there was a slight sound coming from the door behind the green dragon.</p>
<p>The door, slowly opened.</p>
<p>Qinglong and Youji are shocked and turn around to look.</p>
<p>The simple wooden door slowly opened to the inside, issued a low and slight &ldquo;creak&rdquo; sound, with a bit of the past vicissitudes, Xu is also telling the master&rsquo;s sadness.</p>
<p>One foot, from that room, stepped out lightly. Ghost King&rsquo;s figure. Slowly appeared in front of them.</p>
<p>Qinglong and Youji are looking at the man who seems to be separated from the world.</p>
<p>Three days old!</p>
<p>The ghost King&rsquo;s hair has turned white.</p>
<p>Qinglong&rsquo;s voice suddenly became hoarse and hesitant. Even when he heard it, he doubted whether it was his own voice</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zong Lord, you&rsquo;re ok All right? &quot;</p>
<p>The ghost King&rsquo;s mouth moved, but did not speak, but closed his eyes and raised his head slightly. Take a deep breath.</p>
<p>Under the black veil, Youji suddenly said, &ldquo;Lord, take care of yourself The body. &quot; I don&rsquo;t know why. She suddenly thought of Biyao, and her voice was choked.</p>
<p>The ghost King&rsquo;s shoulder trembled slightly, but soon he was subdued. When he opened his eyes again, although vicissitudes and sadness were still engraved on his face, but in his eyes. But it has a light light.</p>
<p>It seems to have seen through the vicissitudes of the world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I look a lot older.&rdquo; He actually is so, said a, the corners of his mouth moved slightly, there is a slight smile, but among them, it is full of bitterness.</p>
<p>Qinglong and Youji bow their heads at the same time and can&rsquo;t bear to see this man again.</p>
<p>Once again, the ghost King took a deep breath, exhaled his breath in his chest, and his eyes turned. After a moment, he fell on the table beside Qinglong&rsquo;s hand, on the small blue and white urn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s in this is&hellip;&rdquo; He asked faintly.</p>
<p>Qinglong took a step, took up the small urn, handed it to the ghost king, and said, &ldquo;after the great wizard died, his subordinates made bold decisions to cremate the old man&rsquo;s body. In this small urn, it is his ashes and relics.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost King took over the blue and white urn in silence, stroked it with both hands for a long time, and sighed softly, &ldquo;although the master didn&rsquo;t rescue Yao&rsquo;er, he exhausted his vitality with his dying body, and recovered Yao&rsquo;er&rsquo;s soul. Although he failed in the end, he was actually our great benefactor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He handed the small urn back to Qinglong again and said, &ldquo;you are ready to return the master to southern Xinjiang with respect to my holy religion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Qinglong took over the blue and white urn and nodded: &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost king was silent for a moment and said, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s wrong with him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The green dragon hesitated for a moment, but Youji was already beside him and said: &ldquo;after coming out of the cold stone room, he seems to have collapsed. He has lost his soul and stumbled all the way back to his room and never came out again.&rdquo; At this point, she pauses and murmurs, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s been three days so far.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost king looked bleak and slowly put his hands behind him. After a long time, he murmured: &ldquo;ten years of sad things are in my heart all night! Well, let&rsquo;s go and see him. &quot;</p>
<p>With that, he walked slowly with his hands down. Qinglong and Youji looked at each other and followed him silently.</p>
<p>Looking from behind, the ghost king has white hair and his figure is strangely desolate.</p>
<p>GUI Li&rsquo;s room is far away from the ghost King&rsquo;s house, but very close to the ice stone room where Biyao is. This is why the ghost king didn&rsquo;t want to be more sad, so he was far away from his daughter&rsquo;s stone chamber. If GUI Li was in Huqi mountain, he would visit Biyao almost every day.</p>
<p>When the three people walk through the corridor and get close to the ghostly room, Qinglong and Youji, who are walking behind, obviously find that the ghost King&rsquo;s body is somewhat different. I don&rsquo;t know if it is because they are close to the sad place again.</p>
<p>But none of them said a word more.</p>
<p>Finally, he came to the lonely stone gate, where he lived. There was no one around. He always liked to be alone. Just outside his door, there was a ghost King disciple standing far away.</p>
<p>The ghost King stepped forward, opened the stone gate and went in. Then he was stunned. Qinglong and Youji also find something wrong. When they walk in and have a look, they can see that the room is empty, not only the ghost figure. Even the ash is gone. All the furnishings in the room were as usual, without any trace of using it. Only the bed was a little messy.</p>
<p>Green Dragon frowned and turned out to call.</p>
<p>Standing outside the door, the disciple of the ghost King clan rushed in and knelt down in front of the ghost king and saluted: &ldquo;see the Lord!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost king turned his head and looked, and Qinglong whispered at his side: &ldquo;in addition to dealing with the affairs of the clan these days, I have been waiting outside the patriarch&rsquo;s gate. As for this, I&rsquo;ll ask these disciples to stay alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost King nodded slightly, turned his head to the disciple of the ghost King sect and said, &ldquo;where is the vice patriarch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The disciple of the ghost King clan was obviously in awe of the ghost king, and even his voice trembled slightly. He said, &ldquo;report back to the master. The Deputy patriarch has shut himself up for three days and three nights in the room, and there is no movement at all. When my subordinates were worried. This morning, he suddenly came out with the grey haired monkey and left here</p>
<p>The ghost king was stunned for a moment. The green dragon frowned and said, &ldquo;where did he go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The disciple buried his head and said, &ldquo;the disciple followed the vice patriarch all the time. Seeing that he walked out of the mountain, he immediately broke through the void. Seeing his look, the disciple was very scared. He did not dare to ask, so he had to come back here and wait&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a flash of anger on Qinglong&rsquo;s face. The ghost king suddenly &ldquo;eh&rdquo; in front of him. He took a few steps forward, picked up a sealed letter from the head of the bed and took a look at it. But he handed it to Qinglong and said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Qinglong was stunned for a moment. He took a look and found it was written by Gui Li. He was confused and looked at the ghost king. But the king&rsquo;s face was blank. Looking away, Qinglong frowned, tore open the seal and read the letter again.</p>
<p>The letter wasn&rsquo;t long. He finished reading it quickly, but his face was gloomy and said in a low voice, &ldquo;Lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ghost King light way: &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Qinglong said: &ldquo;in his letter, he asked me to work hard to send the ashes of this great wizard back to qilidong of Miao Nationality in southern Xinjiang.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost King slowly shakes his head, and suddenly sighs, &ldquo;just, just!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Qinglong was stunned, but the ghost king turned his head and said to the disciple of the ghost King sect: &ldquo;you go down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In case of amnesty, the man knocked heavily three heads and quickly withdrew.</p>
<p>The green dragon looked at the ghost king and said, &ldquo;Lord, that ghost is fierce&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost king looked at the empty room, and his eyes were full of desolation. After a long time, he turned around and didn&rsquo;t greet Qinglong Youji. He just walked in silence. From his back, he heard a deep voice</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are all sad people&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Southern Xinjiang, incense valley.</p>
<p>This great school of righteousness, which has been constantly changing in recent days, has another shocking news today, which has spread all over the valley in an instant.</p>
<p>From the &ldquo;tianxiangju&rdquo; deep in the Fen Xiang Valley, the seven drums ring far and near, indicating that Yun Yilan, the master of the incense Valley who has been closed for a long time, will leave today.</p>
<p>All the disciples of the burning incense Valley returned to their places one after another, and no one dares to neglect it. In the main hall of the burning incense Valley, &ldquo;mountain and river hall&rdquo;, led by the above-mentioned official CE and Lu Shun, and Li Xun and other disciples were all in the back, tied in front of the hall and waited patiently.</p>
<p>Among all the people, what is particularly striking is a woman standing beside Li Xun, which is Yan Hong. Since the night when Jiuwei Tianhu escaped from xuanhuotan not long ago, shangguance still recognized Yan Hong as a fake in the chaos. Later, it was proved that she was disguised as a jinpinger of the Huan sect of the demon sect. However, the real Yan Hong was found in the cellar of a house in the burning incense Valley three days ago.</p>
<p>Naturally, the Gold Vase son did not know how to cure Yan Hong with strange skills and hid in such a place. These days, people in the burning incense valley have gone out and searched all the hills nearby, but they have not paid attention to the houses in the valley. Three days ago, a male disciple went down to the cellar of Tibetan medicine to find Yan Hong. Otherwise, he did not know how long the poor woman would stay in the cellar.</p>
<p>But these days, Yan Hong obviously looks haggard, but at the moment, people do not want to pay attention to her, all eyes are looking at the side door of the main hall. According to the Convention, Yun Yilan after leaving the pass should come out to meet the people.</p>
<p>Standing at the front of the crowd, shangguance was still dressed in black, standing there calmly, but in the depths of his eyes which could not be detected, there was a flicker in his eyes.</p>
<p>For him, in recent years, the valley master, Yun Yilan, who was the elder martial brother, met him every time with a screen. He was even more powerless when he spoke. He was getting older in recent years. At first, he couldn&rsquo;t believe it, but until recently. In his heart, he has gradually recognized that the elder martial brother who has been pressing on his head is really going to die.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, Tianxiang is in the middle today, and the sky drum is like thunder. Shengsheng shakes him in the local area, and Yun Yilan has even gone out of the pass!</p>
<p>Is he really practicing martial arts in seclusion. Rather than cover up what?</p>
<p>Shangguan CE&rsquo;s heart is very upset and uneasy.</p>
<p>But behind shangguance, Li Xun, standing at the head of the younger generation of disciples, has a sense of excitement in his eyes. All along, he is Yun Yilan&rsquo;s most proud disciple. In the incense Valley, he is even more favored by heaven.</p>
<p>Just a few years ago, Yun Yilan suddenly closed down, without any warning in advance, so he did not meet people.</p>
<p>Although Li Xun himself is still very special to Yun Yilan. Like his uncle shangguance, he is the only two people in the burning incense Valley who can meet with Yun Yilan. But I wonder if it is because Yun Yilan thinks that Li Xun is young and not good enough, and that he has let shangguance take charge of the major events in the burning incense valley. In such an invisible way, Li Xun&rsquo;s position has dropped a lot.</p>
<p>But now Yun Yilan is out of the customs again, and the situation has changed greatly. He is the most beloved disciple of the valley master today, and the next valley master is the most benevolent candidate. He speaks with different natural weight. What&rsquo;s more, just yesterday, the night before Yun Yilan left the customs, he had been secretly met by Yun Yilan and knew in advance that his mentor was going to go out.</p>
<p>And with the master&rsquo;s exit, there was a long-standing wish that he had been looking forward to, and it was finally possible to achieve it. At the thought of this, Li Xun&rsquo;s handsome face could no longer restrain his excitement.</p>
<p>Shangguan CE&rsquo;s body moved. He turned back slowly. Although the young nephew tried to keep calm behind him, the joy and excitement from the bottom of his heart could not be covered by his age. It is also impossible to escape shangguance&rsquo;s eyes, which can see through the world like an eagle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey&hellip;&rdquo; He slowly gave a cold smile in his heart and said to himself, &ldquo;young man, you don&rsquo;t know how long the road you are going to go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the same time when all of them were thinking, the drums were melodious, like flying from the sky. Hovering in the hall. The spirit of shangguance and others was so excited that they arranged their appearance and clothes and looked at the side door.</p>
<p>When the red shadow flashed, a shadow of everyone appeared slowly. His red clothes were the clothes of the valley&rsquo;s master, which represented the sect belief of advocating fire.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t feel the heat of the flame, nor did he have the dazzling light. But somehow, the people were so red in front of them, but they all had a feeling of a red flame. Shi Shiran came here like this.</p>
<p>But when people came back to their senses and saw the characters in the red light, including the calm and calm Shangguan policy, they all uttered a low voice of disbelief.</p>
<p>The visitor was just a middle-aged man who looked up and down at most in his 40s. His bright but soft red hair was not tied up, and he was just floating on his shoulders with a trace of elegant and unrestrained flavor.</p>
<p>People looked at each other. When Yun Yilan closed down a few years ago, everyone clearly remembered that he was an old man with gray hair on his head. However, he was much younger than Yun Yilan, and his skin was smooth and smooth, and he could not see any wrinkles.</p>
<p>However, this man&rsquo;s face is clear, but it is the appearance of Yun Yilan, especially shangguance. He has been with Yun Yilan for a long time than anyone else. What&rsquo;s more, he knows that this is what Yun Yilan looked like when he was young. It&rsquo;s just that his face is more than his young demeanor. Under such shock, people can&rsquo;t say a word.</p>
<p>But Yun Yi Lanxing, if nothing happened, swaggered to the main hall. In front of the crowd, his eyes were bright and his eyes were bright. He looked at them. Suddenly, he said with a smile. His voice was old and clear in the secret room. He said, &ldquo;why, you don&rsquo;t recognize me as the valley master?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as they were shocked, Li Xun first came back to his senses and bowed down first. He said in a loud voice, &ldquo;I welcome you to go out of the pass. Congratulations on your great success in practicing Dharma in seclusion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>People suddenly wake up and salute one after another. Shangguan CE&rsquo;s surprise in his eyes gradually fades away and bows his head and makes a salute.</p>
<p>Cloud Yi Lan obviously looks good, the mood is also excellent, waved his hand and said: &ldquo;OK, OK, everyone has not seen for a long time, get up and talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At last, LAN Yun starts to look at all the officials, and they all smile. He said with a smile, &ldquo;younger martial brother, are you tired of letting you take charge of the trivial affairs in the valley these years?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shangguan shook his head and said with a smile, &ldquo;elder martial brother is not here. It&rsquo;s my duty to be a younger martial brother. On the contrary, something happened to xuanhuotan a few days ago. I&rsquo;m&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>Cloud Yi Lan suddenly burst out a laugh and interrupted Shangguan CE&rsquo;s words, saying: &ldquo;the past. Younger martial brother, why should we be so worried about it? In the future, we should consider it from a long-term perspective. &quot;</p>
<p>On the face of official policy brush a silk surprised color, but also did not say what again, bow head way: &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yun Yilan looked at all the people present and saw that they were filled with respect and surprise. Obviously, he looked like a young man again, which made people really surprised.</p>
<p>But he didn&rsquo;t explain much. He turned to Li Xun, who had been standing by for a long time, and asked, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s going on in the valley recently?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li Xun took a step and said respectfully, &ldquo;this morning. The Taoist priest of Qingyun sect in the middle earth sent a letter, saying it was a reply to the letter sent by the master a few days ago. &quot;</p>
<p>He spoke like this, and his face was calm, but the Shangguan policy standing on the side changed. During the period of yunyilan&rsquo;s closing down, he was in charge of all the major events of burning incense valley. Communication with the leader of Qingyun gate is an extremely important thing, but he knows nothing about it. But this reply letter arrived this morning. Somehow, Li Xun intercepted it on the way without letting him know. It is clear that this is the elder martial brother cloud Yi Lan intentionally does not let him intervene.</p>
<p>Shangguance&rsquo;s anger gradually grew in his heart, but he remained the same on his face, and his strange expression flashed away.</p>
<p>Yun Yilan nodded and took the letter from Li Xun. Looking at it, I saw that the number on the top of the envelope was written: Brother Yun Yilan of the incense Valley personally.</p>
<p>The signature is: a visit to Qingyun gate.</p>
<p>As expected, it was the handwriting of immortal Xuan of Qingyun gate. Yun Yilan smiles slightly, tears off the seal, pulls out a piece of tissue paper, and reads it from beginning to end. Always with a smile on his face.</p>
<p>Finally, he nodded slightly, pondered for a moment, put the letter in his arms, and said in a loud voice: &ldquo;this is the end of this day. You go back and prepare. Soon, I will lead the outstanding disciples of the burning incense Valley to visit the friends of Qingyun gate and Tianyin temple and discuss the grand plan of the world together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a long time ago that the burning incense Valley entered the Middle Earth in a large scale. Unexpectedly, as soon as the master Fu of the valley left the pass, he issued this order. However, Yun Yilan has always been highly respected, and the people in the burning incense Valley did not think much about it. After seeing the ceremony, one after another withdrew and went to prepare for nothing. Only Li Xun was left by Yun Yilan.</p>
<p>After everyone left, only Yun Yilan and Li Xun were left on the mountain and river hall. When Li Xun and his master were alone, they were not as stiff as when they were present. He said with a smile, &ldquo;master, what kind of Dharma do you cultivate in seclusion, and have such miraculous effect?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yun Yi Lan laughed and said, &ldquo;this is a strange skill handed down by my ancestor of burning incense valley. When you have done enough in the future, are you afraid I won&rsquo;t pass it on to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li Xun was stunned, but he saw that Yun Yilan had a kind smile in his eyes, which seemed to have profound meaning. After a moment of thinking, he was overjoyed. He quickly fell down and said, &ldquo;thank you for your kindness. I will certainly live up to master&rsquo;s expectations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yun Yilan picked up Li Xun with a smile, looked up and down at him, and sighed, &ldquo;you are a good person to cultivate Taoism. But I think you are young and vigorous, and you are still a bit impetuous. You should grasp more. Only by doing so, can you become a great tool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li Xun nodded repeatedly and said, &ldquo;thank you for your advice.</p>
<p>By the way, master, what can I do for you</p>
<p>Cloud Yi Lan looked at him and said, &ldquo;yes, I want you to go to Zhongtu first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li Xun was stunned and said, &ldquo;Zhongtu? Where are you going? &quot;</p>
<p>The cloud Yi Lan light way: &ldquo;green cloud mountain. I&rsquo;ll write a reply later. You&rsquo;ll leave immediately and deliver this letter to daoxuan immortal of Qingyun Mountain. &quot;</p>
<p>Li Xun nodded: &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yun Yilan walked back and forth for a few steps, and then said, &ldquo;after reading this letter, immortal daoxuan will leave you to stay in Qingyun Mountain for a few days. You don&rsquo;t have to delay. You just stay in Qingyun for a few days. I&rsquo;ll take other people there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li Xun nodded, but was slightly confused and said, &ldquo;master, are you in such a hurry to enter the Middle Earth</p>
<p>Cloud Yi Lan tiny smile, way: &ldquo;it is not you beg me for a long time that matter!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as Li Xun&rsquo;s body shook, his face was filled with excitement. He immediately knelt down again and said in a loud voice, &ldquo;thank you for your success.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yun Yi Lan shook his head and said with a smile, &ldquo;OK, OK, you should go back and prepare for it. When you come to pick up my letter, you can start directly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li Xun promised excitedly and strode out.</p>
<p>When the figure of the young disciple disappeared, the smile on Yun Yilan&rsquo;s face gradually faded. He turned to the South and looked far away towards the 100000 mountains. After a long time, he suddenly snorted</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since you want to come out, I&rsquo;ll let the whole world stand in the way. I&rsquo;m not so stupid to take the burden alone (to be continued. )</p>
