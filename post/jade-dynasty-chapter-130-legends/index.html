      <p>Qilidong, Miao people&rsquo;s altar.</p>
<p>Last night&rsquo;s war did not seem to affect the atmosphere of silence here. Under the leadership of the young wizard, GUI Li and Xiao Bai walked silently in the altar. Lying on the shoulder of the small ash, now seems to be a lot of quiet, as if the surrounding solemn atmosphere, let it also be honest.</p>
<p>Through the long corridor, to the stone house deep in the altar, the young wizard nodded slightly, did not say anything to them, turned around and walked away. After a moment, he was not in the dark.</p>
<p>Around, only the two of them were left. GUI Li and Xiao Bai looked at each other and said, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaobai nodded and agreed, and they walked in together.</p>
<p>This room is still very dark, in front of the deep still burning a pile of flame, flame front, still back to them, sitting a bent figure.</p>
<p>In this familiar scene, in a trance, what happened last night seemed unreal. Maybe it was just a dream</p>
<p>A slight cough sounded on the old man. His back under the light of the fire trembled violently, breaking the silence here and letting people return to reality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here you are,&rdquo; the great wizard said slowly in a hoarse voice after the cough stopped. &ldquo;Come here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li and Xiao Bai walked behind him and sat down quietly in front of the thin old man. Somehow, they both felt that they didn&rsquo;t know what to say.</p>
<p>The great wizard seemed to sigh softly and said, &ldquo;just now my people were rude to you. Don&rsquo;t blame me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li slightly nods, way: &ldquo;dare not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wizard coughed twice again, but he was silent and said nothing more. GUI Li and Xiao Bai had to wait patiently. Unexpectedly, for a long time, the great wizard seemed to be asleep, motionless and unresponsive.</p>
<p>GUI Li&rsquo;s heart is more and more anxious. On the one hand, he didn&rsquo;t know what the great wizard was thinking. On the other hand, a sudden turmoil last night made him almost regret his whole life. If he had missed Biyao because of himself. It&rsquo;s a hundred deaths.</p>
<p>At the moment, waiting for a long time, see the big wizard seems to still not speak, next to Xiaobai is still patient, not in a hurry, Xiaohui has already boss impatient. Monkeys are playful. At the moment, I couldn&rsquo;t stand the solemn atmosphere here. I grabbed it from the East and slipped away from the ghost.</p>
<p>GUI Li was worried and didn&rsquo;t want to delay any more. He said, &ldquo;master, the one I asked for from you&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before the word &ldquo;event&rdquo; was uttered, the great wizard suddenly cut in: &ldquo;young man, let me tell you a story!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost Li one Zheng, looked to the side small white one eye. However, she also frowned. Her eyes were confused. Obviously, she didn&rsquo;t know what the old guy was thinking. But at this moment, after all, he had to sigh in his heart and hold back his impatience. He said with patience, &ldquo;master, please tell me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The great wizard with hoarse voice, in the dark of the altar, the faint ring, as if after thousands of years of time. At this moment, it turns around quietly</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our southern Xinjiang is located in the south of the vast land of Shenzhou. It has never been as prosperous as the middle land, but it has its own unique origin&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li nods silently, a unique custom here in southern Xinjiang. It&rsquo;s different from China.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now people all over the world know that there are five ethnic groups living side by side in southern Xinjiang. But in fact, a long time ago, there were five ethnic groups: Miao, Li, Zhuang, Tu and Gaoshan. In fact, they belong to the same ancient clan, named &ldquo;Wu clan&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both GUI Li and Xiao Bai are stunned. These things do not mean that Gui Li has never heard of them, that is, Xiaobai has no impression.</p>
<p>The figure of the wizard&rsquo;s back is slightly distorted by the burning flame, reflecting on the ground. In his voice, he also has the &ldquo;crack&rdquo; of firewood in the fire</p>
<p>Voice, quiet, with the vicissitudes of the past time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;According to the legend of the clan, in ancient times, the ancient witch clan managed the southern frontier, and had a strong influence. There were many strange people in the clan, among which the witch maids of each generation served the witches, and the witchcraft was the most powerful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The so-called witch maiden is to select a virgin with the highest spiritual power from each generation of the ancient witch clan, serve the witches in the altar, study the witchcraft, and command all the Wu people. This kind of life has been passed for many years, many years&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>GUI Li and Xiao Bai both raise their heads slightly. They are both intelligent people. At this moment, they all know the key point of the great wizard. They are about to come out. At the moment of the small ash, but do not know quietly in the dark where to go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;However, in the third year of the 11th generation of witch maids, a sudden change took place in the 100000 mountains in the southern frontier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The voice of the great wizard is still hoarse, but his tone rises quietly, as if his inner excitement is slowly showing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Among the 100000 mountains, there is a monster called&rdquo; beast God &ldquo;. No one knows the origin of that monster, as if he appeared in the precipitous and ferocious mountains like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At first, no one noticed the existence of the monster, but gradually, the ancestors of the witch clan felt the change. Although the rolling mountains of 100000 mountains are steep, the forests are lush and the animals are numerous. The skillful hunters of the witch tribe can always enter the hunting area. But from that time on, a vicious miasma was suddenly born among the 100000 mountains, and one inhaled it, that is, his whole body was festering to death. What&rsquo;s more, strange changes have taken place in the original normal wild animals. Some monsters have changed into animal heads and human shapes. They are extremely ferocious. They kill people when they see people and eat them when they die. It&rsquo;s creepy. People in the sorcerer clan are terrified for a moment. &quot;</p>
<p>GUI Li and Xiao Bai can&rsquo;t help but look at each other again. What the great wizard said is really weird and unheard of.</p>
<p>The great wizard pauses for a moment, as if immersed in the past that has been buried in the ancient history. After a while, she slowly continued: &ldquo;at that time, the witch lady called together all the wizard leaders of the family to discuss, and finally sent a team of fierce soldiers led by three witches to go to the 100000 mountains to see what strange things happened, which made the mountain suddenly grow poison and animals Change.</p>
<p>But on the tenth day after the team entered the mountain, only one of the most powerful wizard in the lead escaped back, and his whole body was festering. Under the full treatment of the witch lady, it was still invalid, and finally only on the deathbed. He said the word &ldquo;beast demon&rdquo;, and he died like this</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beast demon&hellip;&rdquo; GUI Li and Xiao Bai read the name slowly in their hearts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From this time on, the Wuzu ancestors finally knew. There&rsquo;s a monster out of 100000 mountains. Later, after many explorations, after paying the lives of many warriors, it gradually became clear that this monster suddenly appeared in the mountains of 100000, with incredible uncanny and miraculous power, under his magic law. The original lush mountains have become barren mountains. The clear rivers are full of venom, and there are poisonous miasma everywhere.</p>
<p>The original animals in the forest have also been transformed into monsters by him, such as bear man, tiger man, leopard man, wolf man and so on. They are ferocious and terrifying&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>The corner of the mouth suddenly twitched for a while, cut way: &ldquo;can there be a kind of Fishman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The great wizard&rsquo;s back was shocked and silent for a moment, as if he was recalling something. Then he nodded slowly and said, &ldquo;yes, it is said that there is such a fish man among those ferocious barbarians in the 100000 mountains. Why, are you&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>After pondering for a moment, he finally said, &ldquo;yes, I have seen such a monster with fish head and human body in the Western swamp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The great wizard&rsquo;s body was shocked, and finally he could not bear it. Huo turned his head, and the light of fire shone on his wrinkles. As if the years engraved under the deep ring, and his voice, at the moment has been hoarse: &ldquo;you, you actually saw these monsters?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grimly silent but sure, he nodded.</p>
<p>The face of the great wizard turned white. Na na tunnel: &ldquo;appeared, finally appeared, providence! God&rsquo;s will But why do they appear in the west? At the entrance of Shiwan mountain, isn&rsquo;t there an incense burning Valley guarding the entrance&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>On his old face, there was fear and confusion. The expression changes unceasingly, actually seems to be in a trance.</p>
<p>Ghost Li stretched out his hand and patted the old man on the shoulder.</p>
<p>The great wizard&rsquo;s body was shocked, as if he suddenly woke up. He looked at the ghost, and gradually calmed down. Then he turned his head again and faced the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go on! In any case, if it is the will of God, we mortals are powerless</p>
<p>In his voice, it seemed that there was more desolation in his voice: &ldquo;after knowing about the monster, the people of the witch clan have never lived a stable life any more. Moreover, with the deepening of time, the monsters under the demon began to gradually go outside the 100000 mountains. In this way, the news of the killing of the people was constantly spread from all over the country, and the number of people was increasing. In the end, the ordinary people of the witch clan even began to abandon their homes and move to the North recklessly. If this continues, the whole witch clan will be destroyed. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The witch maids of that generation wanted to know more about the monster and then discuss how to get rid of it.</p>
<p>But at that time, the situation among the sorcerers was furious, and the situation was really at the most critical moment. She finally decided to summon all the sorcerers and warriors of the whole sorcerer clan to fight against the monster and fight him to save the witch clan. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unexpectedly, on the night when the witch maiden made this decision, the monster led his countless demons to kill out of the 100000 mountains and directly killed the ancient witch altar. Wuzu altar is the place where Wuzu people sacrifice to the witches. It has always been the lifeblood of the clan and is sacred and inviolable. That night, it can be said that all the sorcerers, men and women, and even older children, all rushed to the battlefield to fight against those evil demons</p>
<p>Big wizard&rsquo;s voice, said here, gently stopped, and GUI Li and Xiao Bai held their breath. The bloody battle in ancient times, as if in the darkness around, in the bleak words of the great wizard, once again, quietly emerged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can not imagine that the fierce battle, handed down from generation to generation by our ancestors of the Miao nationality, is just a description of the war. In a word, after the blood stained all the land under their feet, and after countless witch soldiers died with their bodies and demons, the monster finally rushed into the witch altar guarded by the witch lady with some demons. Outside the altar, they are still fighting&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just that the great witch finally began to protect his people, and the witch maids of that generation were recognized as the strongest witchcraft people in all ages. After an earth shaking battle, the monster and his several powerful demons were finally trapped by the &ldquo;eight fierce XuanHuo array&rdquo; handed down by the ancient witches in the altar by the witch lady</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; GUI Li and Xiao Bai suddenly lost their voice at the same time.</p>
<p>The great wizard looked back at them strangely and said, &ldquo;eight fierce XuanHuo array&rdquo;, what&rsquo;s the matter</p>
<p>GUI Li and Xiao Bai looked at each other and were silent for a moment, then said: &ldquo;this name is quite strange.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The great wizard sighed. He said: &ldquo;this array was handed down by the ancient witches. It was launched by xuanhuojian, an exotic treasure of the essence of ten thousand fire. It was extremely powerful. It was even a monster who had supernatural powers. They are also trapped in this dharma array. The morale of the people of the sorcerer clan was greatly shaken, and those demons were in great disorder, and they were finally defeated gradually</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just that although the power of&rdquo; eight fierce XuanHuo array &ldquo;is boundless, the power of animal demons is really extraordinary. It can be burned day and night by the eight wild fire dragons. Although seriously injured in the body, but still survived, and Wunv Niang confrontation. At that time, in the whole altar, because the magic power of the array itself was too strong, the Witches of other clans could not get close to help. Only the witch maiden alone supported the huge array with her own magic power. After three days and three nights, when almost all the witch people were going crazy about it, the demon broke out of the array. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But although the beast demon escaped, it was still dying. He didn&rsquo;t dare to stay for a moment, and flew back to his nest in the mountains. When the crowd rushed to the altar, the witch lady was exhausted, almost exhausted, and the lamp was dry. However, the witch lady was really an admirable figure. After a day&rsquo;s rest, she decided to go into the 100000 mountains alone to get rid of the monster. Because if you wait for the monster to reply, I&rsquo;m afraid the end of the Lich will really come. &quot;</p>
<p>Xiaobai sighed softly and said, &ldquo;this witch lady. It&rsquo;s really a heroine of women, a kind-hearted Bodhisattva, who is willing to sacrifice himself for others! &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t believe in Bodhisattvas here in southern Xinjiang,&rdquo; said the great wizard</p>
<p>Xiaobai smiles. No words.</p>
<p>The great wizard continued: &ldquo;at that time, none of the witch people agreed with the practice of the witch lady. Everyone knew that once she went, she would never come back. But the witch lady was determined and finally went. But there were also the bravest soldiers among the seven sorcerers. In this way, a group of eight of them entered the most ferocious mountain of 100000</p>
<p>&ldquo;Along the way, they cut through the thorns and thorns, and I don&rsquo;t know how many monsters they killed. Finally, on the sixth day, they came to the ancient cave where the monster lived. At this moment, the witch lady made an unexpected decision. She asked the other seven people to wait outside the cave, and only she entered the ancient cave.</p>
<p>Naturally, the seven warriors refused, but the witch lady&rsquo;s will was so firm that it would not help to say that they would go in. Instead, it would drag her down. Finally, the seven warriors had to agree</p>
<p>&ldquo;After entering the ancient cave, there was no news any more. Seven warriors waited outside the ancient cave for two days and nights. Finally, two of them couldn&rsquo;t bear to rush into the cave to find the witch goddess. However, the other five thought that they should continue to wait and obey the orders of the goddess.</p>
<p>In this way, the seven warriors quarreled with each other. Finally, the two warriors entered the ancient cave, and there was no news from them</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this way, until the fifth day, when the remaining five warriors gradually lost their confidence, the witch maiden miraculously staggered out of the ancient cave. At that time, the whole person had lost blood, and her face was white and frightening. But the five warriors were so overjoyed that they didn&rsquo;t notice them at all. The witch lady called the five warriors to her side, gave each of them a glittering, full of strange magical power, and told them that the five sacred objects were refined by her body after removing the demon. However, animal demons are the monsters that have been transformed by the most ferocious force between heaven and earth. Although the body is destroyed, the soul will not disperse. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The five warriors were shocked, and the witch lady said again, as long as the five sacred objects do not return to this ancient cave, the beast demon will never be born again! After saying that, her body even trembled, and all of a sudden her seven orifices were bleeding. The five warriors were shocked. The witch maiden exhausted her last strength and told them to protect the five sacred objects forever and never let the beast demon revive. Otherwise, it would be the end of the witch clan and the world. And she, herself, will be forever outside the ancient cave, with her soul to suppress all the demons, lock them in the ancient cave. After barely saying this, the witch lady could no longer hold on and died. But a moment later, her body turned to face the deep of the ancient cave and turned into a stone statue! &quot;</p>
<p>The voice of the great wizard slowly sank.</p>
<p>In the light of the fire, all the people&rsquo;s faces were strange. For a long time, Xiaobai took a long breath and said, &ldquo;what a lady! But what did you tell us about this story, great wizard? &quot;</p>
<p>The back of the great wizard, as if bent by an invisible burden, is extremely desolate. Instead of answering Xiaobai&rsquo;s question, he went on: &ldquo;the five warriors returned to the witch clan after crying and grieving. Although the witch maiden died unfortunately, the monster demon, an unprecedented enemy of the witch clan, was finally suppressed in the ancient cave. The people of the witch family were not only sad, but also somewhat happy. However, at this time, the five warriors with high prestige due to the return of demons fought against each other because they were fighting for the leadership position among the Lich clan. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The most unfortunate thing is that the witch maids of each generation in the sorcerer clan were appointed by the previous generation of witch maids, but this generation of maidens did not leave any instructions. At that time, all the five warriors forgot to ask this question. In this way, the prosperous and powerful witch clan gradually split under the quarrel of the five warriors, and the common people supported one of them. Finally, it gradually divided into the Miao, Li, Zhuang, Tu and Gaoshan nationalities in southern Xinjiang, and the five key sacred vessels were also in the charge of the five clans. &quot;</p>
<p>When the old but thrilling story finally came to an end, he took a deep breath, looked at the back of the wizard, and said slowly, &ldquo;master, did you want me to help you find the sacred vessels of the Miao people?&rdquo; (to be continued. )</p>
