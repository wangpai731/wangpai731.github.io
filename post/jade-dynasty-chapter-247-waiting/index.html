      <p>At this time, a cruel and terrible thing happened, especially among the disciples of the ghost King sect who had finally obtained ten days&rsquo; peace. This once again came ten times more crazy and terrifying than before, which had already made people&rsquo;s nerves stretch to the extreme.</p>
<p>Soon after the violent earthquake, there were people who wanted to escape.</p>
<p>There were not many people who escaped. There was only one, and he was not an important person. He was a common disciple of the ghost King sect. He had been under the Guiwang sect for only three years. The ghost King sect is a branch of the demon sect, and now it is the leader of the holy religion. How can the severe punishment and cool methods of the demon sect be rare?</p>
<p>The fleeing disciple was quickly arrested and severely dealt with, but the shadow and the breathless atmosphere surrounding him could not be removed.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know from when, everyone was silent, so big ghost King&rsquo;s family is dead and lifeless. If you can&rsquo;t speak, no one will speak. The road is to the eye. Under the suffocating obsession, you don&rsquo;t know what is surging in the end?</p>
<p>In this case, the leader of the ghost King sect, the center of gravity of the whole line, remained silent. After making a quick execution of the ghost King sect&rsquo;s disciples to frighten the public, he was still in a simple and mysterious manner. No one knew what the once brilliant overlord was thinking. It was because he also received the influence of that terrible force that he went crazy, or What else did he judge in his mind?</p>
<p>Anyway, no one knows!</p>
<p>However, GUI Li clearly felt this strange atmosphere. In fact, as long as the mind is a little clear and some people need to be rational, they can clearly see the abnormality under the chaos in the Guiwang clan. However, GUI Li has no intention to do anything about this situation.</p>
<p>For him, Biyao is the first.</p>
<p>The most important thing at present seems to be the mysterious power which often appears when the old system is necessary, before he returns to the mountain this time. I have never felt such a mysterious power in Huqi mountain. It is so evil and terrible that it is totally different from human power.</p>
<p>However, he secretly searched up and down the cave of the ghost king. He found nothing but cracks and cracked ground everywhere.</p>
<p>Now there is only one place left that he has not searched - the residence of the ghost king.</p>
<p>However, before GUI Li thought of any way to explore the ghost King&rsquo;s residence, someone had come to him.</p>
<p>Because the earthquake was so strong that day. Even to the point that the rocks above many passageway stone chambers can be shaken down. Since these days, in addition to several times of going out to search secretly, he usually stays in the cold stone room. Even if he goes out, he will try his best to come back as soon as possible. He is afraid of another such violent earthquake suddenly. In case he is not around Biyao, the rock will fall down and hurt Biyao. That&rsquo;s a big, irreparable hate.</p>
<p>At this time, the cave of guiwangzong was obviously no longer a safe place. GUI Li thought of these dangers the next day after the earthquake and asked the ghost king for a talk.</p>
<p>In this regard, the ghost king did not dare to be careless about his daughter. However, in a hurry, he could not find a suitable way to settle Biyao. Besides, Biyao&rsquo;s body has been sleeping for ten years. At this time, she can&rsquo;t easily leave the cold stone platform and move out of the cave of ghost king. It will take time to find a dry and cold place.</p>
<p>Under helpless, although ghost Li is anxious, but also had to endure temporarily. The ghost king sent people to look for a suitable place, and GUI Li was guarding beside Biyao day and night.</p>
<p>After all, the cold stone room is different from other places. These days, the cracks around the stone wall have been repaired in the shortest time. Even the stone gate at the door has also brought a new huge stone from other places. Compared with the past, the cold stone room is not as miserable as other places outside.</p>
<p>GUI Li sat on the ground with his back against the cold stone platform. His eyes drifted in the cold stone room. The monkey was sitting beside him. He looked quite honest. He held several wild fruits from nowhere in his hand and ate them by himself.</p>
<p>In ordinary days, GUI Li usually doesn&rsquo;t bring Xiao Hui to the cold stone room, but now the situation is special. He has to stay by the side of Biyao all day and can&rsquo;t return to his residence. In addition, GUI Li&rsquo;s heart is suspicious of the mysterious power in the depth of Huqi mountain, so he doesn&rsquo;t want to let Xiao Hui run around alone, so he simply brings him with him.</p>
<p>White cold air, from behind the cold stone platform gently floating, in the air like mist general floating, ghost Li silently looking at those hazy cold white smoke, eyes also gradually blurred.</p>
<p>At this time, the stone door of the cold stone room suddenly made a low voice, and then slowly opened. Because it&rsquo;s a new stone gate, the sound sounds a little rusty. After the stone gate, a black figure comes in quietly. It&rsquo;s Mr. ghost.</p>
<p>He gave him a sharp look and did not speak.</p>
<p>The stone door closed slowly again after Mr. ghost, isolating the stone chamber from the outside world.</p>
<p>Mr. GUI walked forward slowly, but he didn&rsquo;t say anything to Gui Li immediately. Instead, he looked at Biyao and gazed for a while. Then he slowly said, &ldquo;miss Biyao has been like this for ten years without realizing it&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fierce face suddenly tightened, and a sharp color shot from his eyes looked at Mr. ghost. Under the black veil of Mr. ghost, I didn&rsquo;t know what expression it was, but I didn&rsquo;t feel it when I saw his body movements.</p>
<p>Slowly, the ghostly eyes gradually drew back and moved to Biyao. Looking at her quiet face with a faint smile, the ghost suddenly felt sad, and a trace of gloom passed on her face.</p>
<p>Mr. ghost looked at GUI Li&rsquo;s expression in his eyes. His eyes flashed slightly and stopped slightly. Then he turned to look at GUI Li and said, &ldquo;do you want to save miss Biyao?&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li raised his eyes to Mr. ghost, but he didn&rsquo;t show how excited his face was. He said faintly, &ldquo;if you have something to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. GUI didn&rsquo;t care about GUI Li&rsquo;s indifferent attitude. He said, &ldquo;although there were some changes and chaos when casting with the astrolabe you brought back that day, I thought about it carefully afterwards, but I didn&rsquo;t hope to cure miss Biyao by pressing the astrolabe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the ghostly face, he turned over and stood up. Seeing the master&rsquo;s action, Xiaohui, the monkey beside him, threw his tail and jumped twice. Then he climbed onto the fierce shoulder and sat down. Then he took a bite of the wild fruit in his hand and looked at Mr. ghost.</p>
<p>Under the gaze of GUI Li and Xiao Hui, one man and one monkey, Mr. ghost stopped for a moment and then continued: &ldquo;in my opinion. This astrolabe treasure is an ancient artifact that has been in the world for a long time, but it has never appeared. It is no small matter</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ancient gods?&rdquo; he said</p>
<p>Mr. ghost nodded and said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s handed down in ancient times. In ancient times, the gods had only handed down a few treasures, all of which had incredible powers and powers, which could not be controlled by human beings. This astrolabe magic weapon should be one of them. &quot;</p>
<p>He pauses. After a look at the ghost, he only saw his eyebrows wrinkled slightly. But he was listening attentively. The black veil on Mr. GUI&rsquo;s face moved slightly, and he said: &ldquo;in the legend, this star plate is mysterious and unpredictable. It contains the profound truth of heaven and earth, and contains infinite mysteries. It can cut off Yin and Yang, stabilize the soul, and observe the heavenly phenomena. Some ancient people said that it can even reach the nature and reverse the cause and effect momentum. It&rsquo;s an incredible treasure. &quot;</p>
<p>GUI Li&rsquo;s mind turned sharply. On that day, in Tianyin temple, two masters Puhong and Pude also said roughly. Although there were some differences among them, it was obvious that this jade plate was by no means an ordinary thing. Did Mr. GUI really have the ability to cure Biyao?</p>
<p>With this in mind, GUI Li&rsquo;s body trembled slightly. He took a step and said, &ldquo;please help her, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost dodged for a moment and avoided the evil. &ldquo;Miss Biyao is the natural daughter of the Lord of the ghost king. I am greatly favored by the Lord. If I can save her, I am bound to do so. But&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>He wanted to talk but stopped. &ldquo;Please say something, sir,&rdquo; he said anxiously</p>
<p>Mr. ghost was silent for a moment and said, &ldquo;as I said just now, this treasure is an ancient artifact. It&rsquo;s magical and unpredictable, and all kinds of powers are among them. I am sure I can understand the magic method and cure miss Biyao. &quot;</p>
<p>This was good news. After listening to it, his reaction was strange. He didn&rsquo;t look ecstatic. He looked away from Mr. ghost&rsquo;s face and turned to look at the direction of the icy stone platform. After a moment, he slowly turned around again. His face was indifferent, but his eyes were vague with sarcasm and vigilance. He said faintly: &ldquo;what does that gentleman mean&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost pondered for a moment and said, &ldquo;I need time to understand the mystery of this astrolabe. If you can trust me, and in order to cure miss Biyao, please lend me the astrolabe for the time being. Once I realize the mystery, I will come to cure miss Biyao immediately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The corner of his mouth moved slightly, slowly showing a sneer. His eyes also became a little chilly. He said slowly, &ldquo;what if I can&rsquo;t believe you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost was stunned and seemed to be suffocated for a moment. He didn&rsquo;t know what to say.</p>
<p>GUI Li said coldly: &ldquo;on that day, outside the ancestral hall of Tongtian peak in Qingyun Mountain, the old man clearly had a deep friendship with you. You killed me without blinking an eye, and I have fought with you several times. We all know whether we have the intention of killing. As you said, the astrolabe is so magical. First, it is related to the treatment of Biyao. Secondly, this magic weapon is not my own. How can I give it to you so easily? &quot;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost sneered and said, &ldquo;in this case, it seems that miss Biyao is not so important in your heart. You would rather give up when there is hope for treatment at present?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ghost Li cold hum a, way: &ldquo;want me to give you the magic weapon to take, that is absolutely impossible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost spread his hands and said, &ldquo;Oh, there is no way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a way, that is to ask you to&hellip;&rdquo; He looked at Mr. ghost, frowned, hesitated for a moment, and finally calmed down his voice. He changed his voice and said, &ldquo;Sir, if you work hard for a while, you can not only understand the magic weapon, but also solve my worries. Would you like to listen to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost &ldquo;Oh&rdquo; a, said: &ldquo;there is still such a way, please say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li said: &ldquo;please, please work hard. You can understand this magic weapon of astrolabe in this cold stone room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost was stunned and said, &ldquo;what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, I will accompany you, or you think it&rsquo;s not suitable for you to understand. I&rsquo;d like to ask you to choose places at will, but I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll follow you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. GUI looked at GUI Li, his eyes flashing, his face as usual, but his eyes were firm. Obviously, he didn&rsquo;t want to give in any more. Mr. ghost was silent for a moment and then said slowly, &ldquo;let me think about it. I&rsquo;ll talk about it later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that, he looked back at Biyao lying on the cold stone platform, and then said, &ldquo;but miss Biyao, she has suffered a lot in the past ten years. You should think about it clearly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He snorted coldly, a trace of pain flashed in his eyes, but his eyes were still sharp and sober, and said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you say more. I know a hundred times better than you</p>
<p>Mr. ghost nodded, turned to open the stone door and left the stone chamber.</p>
<p>When the black figure disappeared, the stone gate closed. GUI Li turned around in silence and sat down beside the cold stone platform. After a long time, he only heard his low voice saying, &ldquo;Biyao. Don&rsquo;t blame me for doing this</p>
<p>After Mr. ghost left the stone chamber, he stood outside the cold stone room for a moment. The passage outside the stone room was still empty as usual, but somehow at the moment, it seemed to be filled with a strange smell.</p>
<p>Mr. ghost looked at the empty passage for a long time, turned to the other side of the road, his feet were silent, in this strange silence, there was no sound at all. Straight as a spirit.</p>
<p>The more you go inside, the more dark the passage will be. But Mr. ghost, dressed in black, seems to be more suitable for such an atmosphere. From a distance, it seems that he is slowly melting into the darkness.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that he&rsquo;s walking.</p>
<p>Suddenly he stopped and looked forward. In front of him, there was a corner of the passage turning to the other direction. There was no light at the corner. It seems that the most dark, and that vague place, but as if there is a figure standing there quietly.</p>
<p>Mr. ghost took a deep look at the shadow and came slowly.</p>
<p>In the dark. The figure moved for a moment, and a low voice came out, saying, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost shook his head in silence and said, &ldquo;he won&rsquo;t give me that treasure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The shadow froze for a moment, as if unexpected, and then somehow. He suddenly took a step forward and said in a deep voice, &ldquo;does he care about Yao&rsquo;er&rsquo;s life or death?&rdquo; Mr. ghost shook his head again: &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t know his temperament. Miss Biyao is the most important person in his heart, but I don&rsquo;t think he can trust me, so he won&rsquo;t give me the astrolabe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The shadow hummed coldly, and slowly came out of the darkness, but it was the ghost king. He looked cold and said, &ldquo;since he refused to give up the treasure, and we haven&rsquo;t finished the blood array here, we can&rsquo;t turn our backs on him for a while. What should we do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ghost Mr. light way: &ldquo;Gui Li, he is still very concerned about Miss Biyao, so just now he made a condition with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost king was stunned and said, &ldquo;what conditions?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost sighed softly and said, &ldquo;he can lend me the treasures of the astrolabe for understanding, but I have to be under his eyes and watched by him all the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost King frowned, hesitated for a moment, and said, &ldquo;we took the treasure to release the heaven and earth lock that bound the Fulong Ding and the four spirits blood array. If he doesn&rsquo;t leave, how should we do the magic?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost gave a bitter smile and said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s difficult to do here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost king was silent and silent. Mr. GUI thought for a moment and said, &ldquo;in my opinion, maybe you should take the treasure first and look carefully at the silkworm. The ancient artifact is very mysterious. Maybe we can find some way to contact the heaven and earth lock from the sky. We should know that the previous astrolabe echoes with the heaven and earth lock on the Fulong Ding, but it&rsquo;s a long way away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost King nodded in silence and said slowly, &ldquo;this is the only way now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost turned and walked up. He said faintly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go and prepare for it first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost King&rsquo;s voice suddenly rang in the back. Mr. ghost smothered for a moment, turned to look at the ghost king and said, &ldquo;what else can I do for you, Lord?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost King&rsquo;s eyes suddenly became a little fierce. After staring at Mr. ghost for a long time, he said slowly, &ldquo;there is one more thing I want to ask you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost said, &ldquo;please speak, Lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost King&rsquo;s face was indifferent, but after his sharp eyes, he seemed to be at a loss. He said, &ldquo;I ask you, in addition to lifting the lock of heaven and earth, is it possible that the age of the ancient god in the astrolabe is also possible How about rescuing Biyao? &quot;</p>
<p>The ghost king was stunned and said, &ldquo;what conditions?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost sighed softly and said, &ldquo;he can lend me the treasures of the astrolabe for understanding, but I have to be under his eyes and watched by him all the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost King frowned, hesitated for a moment, and said, &ldquo;we took the treasure to release the heaven and earth lock that bound the Fulong Ding and the four spirits blood array. If he doesn&rsquo;t leave, how should we do the magic?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost gave a bitter smile and said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s difficult to do here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost king was silent and silent. Mr. ghost thought for a while and said, &ldquo;in my opinion. Maybe you can find a way to contact the heaven and earth lock from the sky. You should know that the previous astrolabe and the heaven and earth lock on the Fulong tripod echo. But it&rsquo;s a long way away. &quot;</p>
<p>The ghost King nodded in silence and said slowly, &ldquo;this is the only way now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost turned and walked up. He said faintly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go and prepare for it first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost King&rsquo;s voice suddenly sounded behind his back, and Mr. ghost smothered for a moment. Turning around and looking at the ghost king, he said, &ldquo;what else can I do for you, Lord?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost King&rsquo;s eyes suddenly became a little fierce. After staring at Mr. ghost for a long time, he said slowly, &ldquo;there is one more thing I want to ask you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost said, &ldquo;please speak, Lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost King&rsquo;s face was indifferent, but after his eyes were sharp, he seemed at a loss and said, &ldquo;I ask you, that ancient god of the astrolabe. Is it really possible to How about rescuing Biyao? &quot;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost was silent. After a long time, he said slowly, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I have to understand the magic weapon carefully before I can understand it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost King&rsquo;s mouth moved, then gently waved his hand and said in a low voice: &ldquo;I understand, you go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost arched his hand to the ghost king and turned away.</p>
<p>The ghost king stood alone in the passage. There was no action for a long time, and the darkness in the passage diffused quietly. The ghost King&rsquo;s lonely figure was gently integrated into the shadow, and soon after, except for the darkness, he could no longer be seen.</p>
<p>In the cold stone room. With his back against the stone platform where he had to go, Xiao Hui, the monkey, was lying on his legs, his head resting on his thighs, snoring and sleeping.</p>
<p>The stone chamber was silent, so quiet that it seemed that you could hear your own heartbeat, and his face was indifferent, but the God in one eye was flashing. There was a faint sense of anxiety. Now it has been a whole day and a night since Mr. Li Gui proposed to understand the magic weapon of the astrolabe, but the black figure has never appeared again. The ghost&rsquo;s heart gradually gets a little uneasy, especially when he sees the figure of Biyao lying on the cold stone platform from the corner of his eyes, the pain in his heart will become more and more intense.</p>
<p>He even has the idea of risking everything for the sake of Biyao.</p>
<p>However, at this time, it seemed to be the reward for his sleepless day and night. The stone door of the cold stone room made a low roar and opened slowly. Mr. ghost&rsquo;s black figure appeared at the door and walked in slowly.</p>
<p>The sound of opening the door boomed, deep and powerful, and woke up the monkey Xiao Hui who was still sleeping. Xiao Hui turned over, got up from the ground and grabbed his head. One or two eyes seemed to be sleepy. After a long time, he regained his mind. Then he showed his teeth and made a fierce grimace to Mr. ghost. Then he turned back and climbed onto the ghost shoulder that had already stood up. It seems that he is very dissatisfied with the ghost Mr. who disturb his dream.</p>
<p>However, the monkey was dissatisfied, but Guili obviously didn&rsquo;t show the same expression. He even gave a gentle breath and a faint smile. He looked at Mr. ghost and simply said, &ldquo;how?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course, Mr. ghost is not a nagging person. He replied directly and clearly, &ldquo;as you said before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li nodded, only to see Mr. ghost indifferent to look around, and suddenly said: &ldquo;but&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what?&rdquo; he said</p>
<p>Mr. ghost said, &ldquo;but we&rsquo;re just afraid it&rsquo;s better to change places.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Why is it a frown</p>
<p>Mr. ghost said: &ldquo;after all, the cold stone room here is the place where Miss Biyao is resting. There were changes in the previous launch of the star chart treasure. If you still understand it here, would it not be harmful to miss Biyao?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ghost Li pondered for a moment, slowly nodded, and said: &ldquo;yes, so to speak, it is really time to change another place to understand.&rdquo; He took a look at Mr. ghost and said, &ldquo;Sir, do you know where the right place is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost said with a smile, &ldquo;since I made a decision before I came here, I naturally thought about everything. Follow me With that, he turned and walked to the cold stone.</p>
<p>GUI Li looked back at the green jade who was lying on the cold stone platform, and said softly, &ldquo;Biyao, you can rest at ease. I will try to save you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biyao was lying there quietly, smiling with music. She looked at him for a long time. Then she turned around, took a deep breath, and strode out.</p>
<p>The stone gate closed slowly behind him. He looked at the black figure and said, &ldquo;please show me the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost gave a low smile. The voice was quiet and strange, and the ghost listened in his ears. I couldn&rsquo;t help frowning. But on weekdays, it seems that the tone of Mr. GUI&rsquo;s conversation is the same, but for some reason, today, it seems to be a little harsh. If you like this book. Please vote for me in Liancheng Book League.</p>
<p>Mr. ghost gently made a gesture to Gui Li, then he turned and walked along the passage toward the deep of the mountain. GUI Li followed him, and monkey Xiao Hui was lying on his shoulder. It seemed that he was not sleepy at the moment. He looked around on his shoulder, especially at the more and more thick and deep cracks on both sides of the passage they were in.</p>
<p>Two people in the dark passage slowly forward, no one nearby, only the sound of footsteps reverberated in the ethereal space. After walking for a while, GUI Li suddenly opened his mouth behind him: &ldquo;can you see the cracks around here, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost&rsquo;s black figure seemed to smother suddenly.</p>
<p>But he didn&rsquo;t stop and didn&rsquo;t turn around to look. He still kept a slow pace and walked slowly. At the same time, he said quietly: &ldquo;these things are so obvious. I naturally saw them, but I don&rsquo;t know why the vice Lord suddenly asked about this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no change in Gui Li&rsquo;s pace. As Mr. ghost walked forward slowly, he only looked at the cracks in the surrounding stone walls, and his eyes flashed. Finally, he slowly returned to Mr. GUI&rsquo;s back and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been to the ghost king for ten years. Such a strange thing has never happened. Sir, you have been living in the ghost King clan for a long time, and you have learned a lot. Maybe you can solve my doubts? &quot;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost suddenly stopped. The black figure seemed to solidify suddenly, and the ghost behind him almost stopped at the same time and looked at him quietly. The dark passage is empty. It seems that only the darkness is quietly diffused. It slowly gathers beside the black figure of Mr. ghost. Mr. ghost is silent for a long time. Then slowly turned around and looked at the ghost.</p>
<p>Ghost Li stands behind him, does not have the slightest evasive manner, looks directly at his eye.</p>
<p>Mr. ghost was covered with a black veil and could not see his expression clearly. However, his eyes and eyes were very bright, which was quite out of proportion to the darkness around him. He only listened to his low voice and stable tone. He said quietly, &ldquo;excuse me, the vice patriarch has let countless people in the ghost King&rsquo;s clan leave him alone. Why did he ask me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li stares at his eyes and says faintly: &ldquo;of course, I know that you are the first person in the Guiwang clan, so I sincerely ask for advice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. GUI was silent for a moment and looked at the ghost. However, he could not see what he was thinking in his heart. After a long time, he said slowly: &ldquo;these cracks are caused by several earthquakes in the area of Huqi mountain a few days ago, even the mountain body vibrates and the stone wall cracks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li looked at Mr. ghost deeply. There was light flowing in his eyes. He said, &ldquo;is it because of this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost suddenly asked, &ldquo;otherwise, what do you think is the reason?&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li didn&rsquo;t speak. The channel where they were still talking suddenly became quiet with a cold breath. Mr. ghost suddenly had a little illusion that he gathered around the young man in darkness and darkness around him.</p>
<p>After a moment, the ghost sharp light way way: &ldquo;I just sincerely ask for advice, there is no other intention, sir said it is this reason, naturally it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost took a deep look at the ghost, slowly turned around, and continued to walk forward, and behind him also sounded the ghostly footsteps.</p>
<p>On the stone wall of the passage beside them, the huge cracks crisscrossed and ferocious, seemed to be laughing at them and growling silently.</p>
<p>The shadow of two people, in the passage slowly to a deeper place, the dark behind them, quietly surrounded up, the last ray of light, are quietly swallowed up.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how long I walked in the passage. The ghostly eyes behind Mr. ghost are staring at the surrounding environment and frowning slowly.</p>
<p>Finally, Mr. ghost stopped and stood at the door of a very secluded stone chamber. Obviously, he chose this place. But the double eyebrow of ghost sharp, it is lock more tightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just as Mr. ghost stretched out his hand to open the stone gate, GUI Li suddenly opened his mouth behind him and said, &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t this the stone chamber of the Lord of the ghost king?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost slowly turned around and said quietly, &ldquo;yes, it&rsquo;s here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want to understand the astrolabe here?&rdquo; he frowned</p>
<p>Mr. ghost nodded. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said</p>
<p>GUI Li took a cold look at him and said, &ldquo;there are thousands of stone chambers in the cave of ghost king. Why did you just choose here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost took a sharp look, and the light in his eyes flashed by. &ldquo;Why, do you feel something wrong about choosing the residence of the Lord of the ghost king?&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li was silent. If he really wanted to talk about it, he couldn&rsquo;t really say what was wrong with the ghost King&rsquo;s stone chamber. But these days, in order to track down that mysterious power. He had secretly searched every corner of the cave, but the place where the ghost king lived. After all, he still had some fear and did not search carefully.</p>
<p>Staring at the stone gate, after a moment&rsquo;s silence, he said: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have anything, but this is the place where the patriarch lives after all. Is it better to inform him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost gave a low smile and said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t worry. I have already told the patriarch that it was to cure miss Biyao. Naturally, the Lord agreed immediately. As for why I chose to be here&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>There was a flash in his eyes. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just because it&rsquo;s quiet here,&rdquo; she said quietly</p>
<p>GUI Li took a look at Mr. ghost, then sneered and said, &ldquo;just quiet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost seems to be unable to hear the other meaning of the ghost sharp words, light way: &ldquo;that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shut his mouth and said no more.</p>
<p>Mr. ghost nodded, reached out and opened the stone gate. In the deep and familiar roar, the stone gate moved away slowly to the side, revealing the simple room decorated inside.</p>
<p>GUI Li followed Mr. ghost in and then looked around. I saw as like as two peas of the wall hanging around the wall, and the walls hanging on the wall, but I was not able to remember it for the moment. When was the last time I visited the ghost King&rsquo;s residence?</p>
<p>The ghost king was not in this room. Mr. ghost turned to meet the ghost and said with gentle eyes: &ldquo;the Lord of the ghost king has ordered in advance, so that we can have a good understanding here. He is very busy and will not disturb us these days. &quot;</p>
<p>GUI Li nodded silently, and then he thought of something and said, &ldquo;by the way, there is Biyao&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost waved his hand and said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t worry, the Lord has said that he will take care of miss Biyao during the period of our understanding. If you don&rsquo;t believe others, you won&rsquo;t even believe miss Biyao&rsquo;s father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a moment&rsquo;s silence, he nodded and said, &ldquo;so I&rsquo;m at ease. Sir, if there&rsquo;s nothing else, let&rsquo;s start now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost took two futons from one side and threw them to Gui Li. He sat down on a futon and said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s OK.&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li sat down on another futon, took out the magic weapon wrapped in black cloth from his arms, untied the black cloth, gazed at the astrolabe for a moment, and slowly handed it to Mr. ghost.</p>
<p>Lying on the shoulders of the monkey small gray eyes with the slow movement of the astrolabe, the face seems to have become a little strange.</p>
<p>Mr. ghost took over the astrolabe. His hands were warm and the light white soft light was scattered from the astrolabe. It flowed gently in front of him and reflected in his eyes. He looked at the astrolabe quietly and looked at it one by one, as if he wanted to see through the treasure.</p>
<p>In the stone chamber, there was a silence. It seemed that even the breath was silent.</p>
<p>On the other side of guiwangzong cave in Huqi mountain, after GUI Li left with Mr. GUI, he fell into a cold and icy chamber as quiet as usual. The cold white air, with a bit of loneliness, floated quietly in the stone room.</p>
<p>As like as two peas in the stone room, the green figure still lay there quietly, motionless, with a calm expression on her face and a faint smile on her lips. It seemed that everything was exactly the same as it was ten years ago.</p>
<p>She is still so beautiful, but I don&rsquo;t know if there was a faint sadness or a faint regret in her heart?</p>
<p>The cold air of white is floating like light smoke. It seems that it has been a dream for a long time and the shadow is looming in the dream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ding!&rdquo; All of a sudden, a very clear voice, bundle fine but clear in the cold stone room ring up. The invisible sound wave passed by like a breeze, and the light like fog and cold smoke floating in the stone chamber suddenly and gently trembled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ding!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a light ring again, but this time it was more clear. The sound came from the white hands of Biyao and the small Albizzia bell.</p>
<p>In the stone chamber, the originally scattered smoke seemed to start to move faster, but the pleasant bell echo rebounded from the surrounding stone walls. The front sound followed by the back sound was continuous, interwoven into a quiet music, with some joy, some sadness, some excitement, and some sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ding!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sound of the third bell that sounded on its own was suddenly raised. In an instant, the white smoke in the stone chamber flowed backward, like a sea of clouds and waves. With a clear roar, the stone broke through the clouds and went straight up. The light golden light was faintly seen from the hands of Biyao.</p>
<p>In the stone chamber, there is a faint sound of wind and thunder. After a moment, it seems to be powerless. The sharp voice slowly drops down, and the golden light between the fingers of Biyao is gradually fading.</p>
<p>The sound of the bell slowly disappeared in the cold stone room, and the white smoke returned to normal, floating gently, as if nothing had happened just now, leaving no trace.</p>
<p>Silence returned to the stone chamber.</p>
<p>I do not know how long, the stone door of the cold stone room suddenly came a low roar, slowly opened, the ghost King&rsquo;s figure appeared at the door, slowly walked in.</p>
<p>He walked slowly to the side of the cold stone platform, looked at his daughter, and after a long time, he said in a low voice, &ldquo;Yao&rsquo;er, it&rsquo;s dad who has come to see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is no change in the expression of Biyao, just like every moment in this decade.</p>
<p>The ghost king had been used to such a result for a long time. His eyes towards his daughter were full of love and no more ferocious. He sat down on the side of the stone platform and looked up at the white smoke floating in the air in the stone chamber.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yao er Ten years. You&rsquo;ve been sleeping like this for ten years He suddenly laughed, a bit bitter and astringent at the corner of his mouth, and said in a low voice, &ldquo;if you wake up now, will you not know dad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused for a moment, then shook his head gently, and gave a bitter smile, as if laughing at himself. He said to himself, &ldquo;how can it be? You will recognize me, of course, but surely you will say: Dad, why do you have so much white hair?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost King&rsquo;s hand, gently stroked in his flat hair, and his face and expression, also appeared a little confused. Between the fingers, there was white hair.</p>
<p>He fell into a moment of silence, as if in memory of something, I do not know whether to sigh his aging, or to recall the father and daughter&rsquo;s past time.</p>
<p>After a long time, I heard his voice say softly: &ldquo;Yao&rsquo;er, don&rsquo;t worry. As long as dad is alive, he will save you. GUI Li and Mr. GUI&rsquo;s two children have gone to understand the magic weapon of the astrolabe. I hope God will open his eyes and find a way to save you from it&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>At this point, the ghost King stopped, and his expression gradually became colder and colder. After a moment, he said quietly, &ldquo;but if the sky doesn&rsquo;t open your eyes, you don&rsquo;t have to be afraid. As long as the astrolabe can unlock the lock of heaven and earth, and the four spirits blood array is successful, then my father will be omnipotent and dominate the world. It will be easy to save you ！”</p>
<p>The white smoke suddenly retreated a foot outwards. At that moment, the ghost King seemed to be agitated in his heart. There was an invisible gas all over his body, which suddenly burst out. After a long time, he saw that the white smoke slowly floated back and condensed in the middle of the stone chamber again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid, don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; the ghost King&rsquo;s eyes are still staring at those white smoke in the air, but the words in his mouth are still so soft, &ldquo;Dad will surely save you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cave where Dad lived is the closest place to the blood pool where the four spirits blood array is located.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, all we have to do is wait slowly&hellip;&rdquo; (to be continued. )</p>
