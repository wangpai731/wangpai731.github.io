      <p>Like a sudden rain falling from the dark night sky, and in the deep sea far away, waves of strong winds, like wild animals breaking through their cages, roared to this lonely island in the boundless sea.</p>
<p>The wind and rain, overwhelming over, in a flash, these people fell into the wind and rain.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan, following the crowd, stopped and raised his hand to cover the urgent wind and rain.</p>
<p>In front of us, in the wind and rain, the surging sea, in this night, seems to wake up from sleep, like a giant beast, began to roar!</p>
<p>In front of Zhang Xiaofan and others, there is a long beach, and at the end of the beach, it is the sea that appears a little ferocious at the moment. In the boundless dark night, the higher and higher waves came one after another, slapping heavily on the flat beach. Each time, it seemed that the ground shook a little.</p>
<p>One wave, another!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like some fierce beast, stepping on the surging waves, walking towards them slowly!</p>
<p>There was silence in the sky, except for the dull thunder in the dark clouds.</p>
<p>People change color, the power of heaven and earth, and even in this!</p>
<p>Tian ling&rsquo;er said to song Daren in surprise, &ldquo;what can I do, elder martial brother? What is this? &quot;</p>
<p>Song Daren was also shocked. He had never seen such a scene before. He frowned for a while. What should he do? Zhang Xiaofan, who was standing behind, was surprised. However, he was calm because he had seen the scene of the black water black snake when it was born in the ruthless seaside under the dead spirit abyss. But when I think of the power of the black water snake that day, it&rsquo;s really beyond the human power to resist, and I feel a little cold for a while.</p>
<p>As soon as I thought about it, Zhang Xiaofan suddenly moved in his heart, and subconsciously looked at Lu Xueqi, but saw that the beautiful woman stood silently beside her. The wind and rain wet her clothes and hair and pasted them on her white face. Just looking at the dark place of the deep sea in front of me, I was stunned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh? &ldquo;All of a sudden, Du Bishu, who was standing in front of him, made a cry and pointed forward. Hurry up and say, &ldquo;look at the front, as if someone is there! &quot;</p>
<p>All of them were shocked. Looking around, they could see dozens of people&rsquo;s shadows emerging from the darkness on the beach tens of feet away. It&rsquo;s all in black. In the dark, it&rsquo;s hard to tell if you don&rsquo;t pay attention to it. I think Du Bishu is always sharp eyed, and he found it.</p>
<p>However, it was found that the sky was full of wind and rain, and the night was heavy. People could not see what those people were doing at all, only vaguely saw them scattered and busy on the beach.</p>
<p>Tian ling&rsquo;er frowns. Turning around, he said, &ldquo;do you see clearly? Who are these people? &quot;</p>
<p>Du Bishu and song Daren shook their heads at the same time. Suddenly, Lu Xueqi said, &ldquo;these people are all from the demon sect! &quot;</p>
<p>Tian ling&rsquo;er was stunned for a moment, and then he realized that at the moment, the main gate of Liubo mountain was fighting with the demon cult. How could these dozens of people do these things on this strange beach?</p>
<p>At the thought of this, she was even more worried and couldn&rsquo;t help looking back, but she saw that none of the demons who were fighting just now walked out of the forest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What to do? Senior brother? &quot;</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s eyes fell on Song Daren, who hesitated for a moment. Finally, he decided to stay away for a while and said, &ldquo;we are in a bad situation, so we should leave here first. &quot;</p>
<p>Say hello to everyone. I&rsquo;m going to turn around and walk away from the beach. Unexpectedly, after a few steps, all the people heard a long roar like a dragon, which came from the deep sea.</p>
<p>In a moment, the wind, rain and thunder in the sky roared together, a lightning tearing the sky. Across the sky, with a loud thunder overhead, the big waves and waves in the sea are as high as the hills. Suddenly, they split apart like living tears!</p>
<p>Numerous spray splashes, wind and rain, from the deep dark depths, as if stepping on the sound of thunder, a huge figure suddenly leaped out of the deep sea, after almost integrated with the night, fell heavily.</p>
<p>The whole Liubo mountain suddenly seemed to vibrate together!</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan and others immediately held their breath. It turned out to be a huge strange beast. Its head is a little bigger than the holy water unicorn on the sky peak of Qingyun Mountain. Its whole body looks like a cow. Its body is green and pale, but there is no horn on its head.</p>
<p>But the most incredible thing is that under the huge body of this strange beast, there is only a strong and incomparable foot, growing in the middle of its stomach. Looking at the past, it seems to be a kind of one-way play of the common people. Under the fierce and incomparable appearance, there is a little bit of funny and lovely.</p>
<p>At this moment, those people in black on the beach immediately quietly retreated into the darkness, but on the beach, every few feet away, there was a strange thing that flashed a light red light, just in front of the strange beast, surrounded by a huge circle. In the night, even after the wind and rain, it was still very striking.</p>
<p>Here in Qingyun gate, people look at each other. They don&rsquo;t know what the people of the demon sect are doing? It seems that they are trying to deal with this strange giant beast, but the trap is too obvious. Anyone can see the red diaphragm in the night, but they don&rsquo;t know what the strange beast is?</p>
<p>Sure enough, since the strange beast came out of the dark deep sea, it seems that it has felt something. It has been standing on the rough sea, not on the shore, only stretching its huge head into the air and smelling it frequently.</p>
<p>Suddenly Du Bishu was shocked and lost his voice. &ldquo;No, this guy may have bad eyes! &quot;</p>
<p>All the people also responded that the red spots on the beach were very obvious at the moment, but the strange beast turned a blind eye to the things in front of it. Were they living in the deep sea in the past, without eyes, so they degenerated?</p>
<p>Somehow, people in Qingyun sect are worried about this strange beast.</p>
<p>After a short period of suffocating time, there was no sign that the thunder and lightning flashed and the wind and rain were clear, but the strange animal didn&rsquo;t seem to find anything. It shook its head and didn&rsquo;t see how hard it used to. Suddenly there was another thunder in the sky, and the huge body leaped forward.</p>
<p>That strong and incomparable leg stepped into the beach of Liubo mountain, stepped on a deep footprint in the red light.</p>
<p>In the dark, in the dark. Almost at the same time, there was a mysterious chanting of incantations.</p>
<p>The voice, like the voice of the netherworld, is deep and distant, floating in the wind and rain in the night sky. meanwhile. Along with the mysterious mantra, the light spot that just emitted a faint red light suddenly lit up at the same time. However, those people in black who just disappeared also returned to the mysterious objects that were inserted on the ground.</p>
<p>This strange beast.</p>
<p>Suddenly raised his head, a moment later, issued a huge roar!</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re crying&rdquo;</p>
<p>The huge voice almost turned into tangible sound waves, and countless wind and rain unexpectedly flew out in this roar like falling into mortal thunder, shooting out!</p>
<p>But at this time, all the people in black put their hands on the mysterious object on the beach.</p>
<p>In an instant, those things on the ground are bright in time, red light is crystal clear, and red light is suddenly emitted horizontally every few feet away. In a moment, it became a whole, forming a huge red aperture.</p>
<p>Before everyone could react, the red circle rose again, and countless dazzling red lights shot up at the same time, forming a spectacular red light wall, which trapped the strange beast in the light wall, and at the same time, it went straight up to the sky, and finally in the sky, at a certain point.</p>
<p>It was as if the night had lifted its veil. The darkness receded quietly, and a figure appeared slowly in the air.</p>
<p>The ghost King stands proudly on an ancient tripod floating in the sky. With a solemn face, he held the Dharma formula with his hands across his chest and recited the mysterious mantra in a low voice.</p>
<p>And all the red light came to the ancient tripod floating under his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re crying&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was another roar of fury, and the strange beast leaped up in fury surrounded by the red aperture. Straight into the light wall.</p>
<p>The face of the ghost king in the middle of the sky was tight, and the voice of chanting the incantation was fast.</p>
<p>In the distance, all the people in Qingyun gate are stunned at the moment, forgetting that it is a good chance for them to escape. They look at the field without blinking.</p>
<p>In the sky, as if on the top of the ghost King&rsquo;s head, a thundering, suddenly blow up, that strange beast hit the light wall hard!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boom! &quot;</p>
<p>The thunder rumbled and resounded through the sky. Suddenly, the huge and magnificent red light wall trembled. Countless small electric currents, like lightning, galloped across the light wall. The sound was harsh, and the people in black, who were standing at the foot of the giant beast, were shaking all over.</p>
<p>In the middle of the sky, the ghost King&rsquo;s face seemed to turn white!</p>
<p>But in the end, after the violent shaking, the red light curtain did not break, but gradually stabilized, and the ancient tripod at the foot of the ghost King seemed more brilliant!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh&rdquo;</p>
<p>The enraged giant beast almost fell into madness. As the thunder in the sky continued to blow, the whole body of the strange beast flashed blue light and hit the huge light wall that trapped it again and again.</p>
<p>The wind and rain roared between the heaven and the earth, as if on nine days, there were thunderbolts roaring angrily!</p>
<p>The roaring thunder seemed to shake Liubo mountain and the whole sea every time!</p>
<p>But under the great power of the heaven and the earth, the red light wall, including the ancient tripod in the sky, did not know where it came from, but it was towering. Gradually, it suppressed the momentum of the strange beast.</p>
<p>Time passed quietly, and the impact of the strange beast became more and more powerless. However, on the other side of the demon sect, it seemed that it was not easy. The ghost King standing on the ancient tripod in the mid air was better, but his face was pale. Obviously, it was not easy for him to be trapped by the magic. Even if the ancient tripod, the strange magic weapon, helped him.</p>
<p>And the dozens of people in black on the ground, at the moment, more than half of them have fallen to the ground, and they were killed by these two forces. The rest of the people looked at it, and only a few people who were good at Taoism insisted on keeping around the light curtain.</p>
<p>All over the sky, the wind and rain are converging at the moment, as if to indicate something.</p>
<p>In the end, after the last collision, the strange beast was useless. He stood still and didn&rsquo;t move.</p>
<p>All the people of Qingyun gate, who had come back to God, looked at each other and couldn&rsquo;t speak for a while.</p>
<p>For a while, Du Bishu said to song Daren, &ldquo;elder martial brother, what should we do? &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan also looked to song Daren. In the exciting contest just now, he only saw that he was very excited. Somehow, he felt a little sympathy for the strange beast, and deeply felt that he wanted to help it.</p>
<p>Actually speaking. Among the disciples of Qingyun sect, Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s idea is not absent. They have been hostile to the demon sect for thousands of years, and have seen the demon sect take so much trouble to catch this strange beast. I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s a big deal.</p>
<p>But song Daren, as a senior brother, was silent for a moment, and finally shook his head, saying, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s not get into trouble, let&rsquo;s go! &quot;</p>
<p>The crowd glanced at each other.</p>
<p>No one spoke, after all, knowing that this is not the time to make a new start, but to follow song Daren who has already moved forward.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan walked a few steps at the end of the walk, and suddenly found that Lu Xueqi didn&rsquo;t follow up. He was surprised. Looking around, he saw Lu Xueqi standing in the same place, without moving his feet. He said, &ldquo;sister Lu, what&rsquo;s the matter with milk? &quot;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi looks at the strange beast trapped in the red light wall in front of her. He looked down at the moment, as if he had already confessed his life, and stood there listlessly. At this time, the sky was full of dark clouds, and they were gradually dispersing. When it was just going out to sea, the heaven and the earth changed their colors. It could not be seen any more.</p>
<p>Just like, a sad child at the end of his life, standing there with a dead heart!</p>
<p>A little desolate, a little lonely</p>
<p>&ldquo;Choking! &quot;</p>
<p>The blue light is like a shooting star in the night. It lights up the darkness.</p>
<p>Tianya divine sword definitely goes out of its sheath, and the clear blue light flashes away, reflecting on its beautiful and peerless master&rsquo;s face, with a touch of indifference. There are still eyes.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi slowly turned around and looked at Zhang Xiaofan. Her face was as cool as water, and she said lightly, &ldquo;this strange beast seems to have a lot to do with it. Hurry up, you go! I&rsquo;ll come as soon as I go! &quot;</p>
<p>When everyone was stunned, Zhang Xiaofan opened his mouth slightly. He lost his voice and said, &ldquo;milk&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before the voice fell, the beautiful figure turned into the brilliant meteor light in the night, pierced the darkness around, and rushed to the huge red light wall.</p>
<p>The people of Qingyun sect were shocked. Zhang Xiaofan, Tian linger and Du Bishu turned around almost at the same time and called to song Daren, &ldquo;elder martial brother&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren&rsquo;s forehead is drenched with sweat. If he wants to leave, he is afraid that he will not be able to pass the pass of the crowd. However, most of them will remain in danger. These younger martial brothers and younger martial sisters are not sensible, but they want to think about their lives. For a moment his mind was in a mess.</p>
<p>However, Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s speed of driving the sword was so fast that he rushed to the beach where the light circle of the demon sect was located. At the moment, the people of the demon sect also found out that it was not right, and the scream started all around.</p>
<p>The ghost king was still floating in the middle of the sky, his face gradually flattened. At this moment, he looked down, frowned, and said a low sentence in his mouth: &ldquo;Tianya divine sword? &quot;</p>
<p>Seeing that the people in black of the demon sect were suddenly at a loss for Lu Xueqi, and the ghost king in the middle of the sky seemed to have no time to get down, even the strange beast trapped in the light curtain suddenly opened his eyes that had been closed all of a sudden.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, a clear light came out of the road and blocked Lu Xueqi. Tianya divine sword made a sharp sound and pushed the group back a little. But Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s own figure was also immediately blocked a few feet away from the red light curtain.</p>
<p>Qinglong, still in a smart white suit, suddenly appears in front of Lu Xueqi like a ghost. At the same time, his right hand, wearing the heaven and earth light ring, returns to his sleeve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This girl,&rdquo; Qinglong said with a smile, as if Lu Xueqi was not the enemy at all. He said, &ldquo;this Kui ox was trapped by our efforts, and it didn&rsquo;t hurt your school. Why should we have a dispute? &quot;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi breathed deeply and knew that the man in front of her was unpredictable. She was afraid that she was not his enemy, but her eyes turned and her eyes fell on Kui Niu, the strange beast. However, she saw Kui Niu also looking forward to this place. Her eyes were bright and her mouth was growling. I don&rsquo;t know what she was thinking at this moment?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Demon! &ldquo;She suddenly stopped drinking, but she didn&rsquo;t care about others. The blue light of Tianya divine sword was dazzling, and she rushed to Qinglong.</p>
<p>Qinglong was stunned. In the face of Tianya, he dared not look down on him even though he was a god soldier. He had to face the battle with a frown.</p>
<p>In the field, the blue light suddenly became one, but after all, Qinglong&rsquo;s Taoism is higher than Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s, and it seems that Qingguang ring of heaven and earth is not inferior to Tianya. After a while, it immediately gained the upper hand, and Qingguang gradually suppressed the blue light.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan looked in his eyes and was worried. He turned around. Song Daren bit his teeth and said, &ldquo;younger martial sister. Milk and younger martial brother immediately take the fourth elder martial brother with them. We will go to CUA in the past. If there is a gap, we will come at once. &quot;</p>
<p>Tian ling&rsquo;er said in a hurry, &ldquo;elder martial brother, I</p>
<p>Song Daren stared and said angrily, &ldquo;there is no time to talk with milk. step on it! &ldquo;Then, as soon as he called Du Bishu, he rushed to the field, leaving Zhang Xiaofan and Tian linger standing in the same place.</p>
<p>In fact, according to song Daren, he didn&rsquo;t want to meddle in this business.</p>
<p>But Lu Xueqi is from our school. He can&rsquo;t ignore it. But the situation is very dangerous. There are two big demons in the other side, the ghost king and the green dragon. In an emergency, he can only take care of the younger martial brother and younger martial sister first, go up and have a look on his own. If he has a chance, he can go.</p>
<p>Tian ling&rsquo;er was scolded by song Daren. Instead, he was shocked and grew up. Song Daren loves her very much. She never scolds her. Today, she suddenly says something. She still can&rsquo;t respond.</p>
<p>After all, she is an outstanding disciple of Qingyun sect, and she has been very pampered since she was a child. She frowned for a moment and said to Zhang Xiaofan, &ldquo;Xiaofan, take care of the fourth senior brother here. I&rsquo;ll go to Cuan u&rsquo;ai.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was surprised and didn&rsquo;t speak. He Dazhi, who was injured at the same time, struggled and cried, &ldquo;little martial sister, it&rsquo;s dangerous there. You can&rsquo;t go there! &quot;</p>
<p>But once Tian linger has made up his mind, how can he still listen to him. At the moment, unless Tian is not easy to be here, he Dazhi can still manage her. What he Dazhi said, however, can only make her ear wind.</p>
<p>As soon as he Dazhi saw that tianling&rsquo;er was not paying attention, he would turn around and hurriedly say to Zhang Xiaofan, &ldquo;younger martial brother. Hold her! &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan woke up and hurriedly ran to take Tian ling&rsquo;er&rsquo;s sleeve and said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t go there, elder martial sister. I&rsquo;ll help you here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A word &ldquo;busy&rdquo; has not yet been said. Tian ling&rsquo;er is in a hurry. She shakes off Zhang Xiaofan. Zhang Xiaofan is in a hurry. She has to hold Tian ling&rsquo;er again. Unexpectedly, at this time, Tian ling&rsquo;er shakes her hands and rises up. At the same time, a small round thing suddenly falls from her sleeve.</p>
<p>A beautiful and smooth stone slipped in the night.</p>
<p>Vaguely, it seemed that a woman smiled and said, &ldquo;when we get back, I will give this stone to brother Qi. He will like it! &quot;</p>
<p>All of a sudden, he froze, reaching into the air, and then stopped in place, motionless.</p>
<p>Until he Dazhi&rsquo;s anxious voice behind him shouted, &ldquo;little martial brother, why don&rsquo;t you hold her! &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan woke up suddenly with a shock. He was sweating all over. He saw Tian ling&rsquo;er was already driving amber and Zhu Ling to the field. At the moment, he didn&rsquo;t think much about it. He hurriedly chased after him with the burning stick.</p>
<p>Tian ling&rsquo;er flies to the sky, only to see song Daren and Du Bishu have joined the battle group of Lu Xueqi and Qinglong. However, Qinglong, with one enemy and three enemies, doesn&rsquo;t lose the wind at all. Instead, he looks calm and has more edge.</p>
<p>Tian ling&rsquo;er is a little impatient, but she is talented. At a glance, she can see that Qinglong&rsquo;s Taoism is too high, and her magic weapon is strong. Even if you add it, you may not be able to beat him. As soon as his eyes turned, he had other ideas. Instead of flying to Lu Xueqi and others, he turned around and quietly flew to the other side of the huge light curtain.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan follows and loses his color in a panic. But it seems that green dragon has attracted the past with one enemy and three enemies. Even the ghost king who presides over the Dharma formation at the top, his eyes are constantly changing with Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s Tianya divine sword, and he ignores Tian linger for a while.</p>
<p>Tian ling&rsquo;er is close to the other side of the light curtain in a twinkling of an eye. The people in black, who were originally guarding here, have fallen into the ground in disorder. Apparently, they were killed in the drama fight that trapped Kui Niu just now.</p>
<p>Tian ling&rsquo;er&rsquo;s eyes swept quickly, and suddenly noticed that all the red light was emitted from some strange dark red iron cone things that were inverted in the sand, and then it was continuously launched upward, converging into the ancient tripod at the foot of the ghost king in the mid air.</p>
<p>Obviously, the array of these things and the ancient tripod in the mid air are the key to trapping Kui Niu. Tian ling&rsquo;er didn&rsquo;t think much about it. With a wave of jade fingers, amber and Zhu Ling immediately flew out, sweeping straight at the things that were inserted upside down on the beach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bang! &ldquo;With a loud sound, amber and Zhu Ling hit the iron cone covered by the red light curtain. Note 1: kuiniu in the East China Sea: there are Liubo mountains in the East China Sea, which are seven thousand miles into the sea. There are animals on it, which look like cattle. They have no horns but a foot. When they enter or leave the water, they will encounter wind and rain. Their light is like the sun and the moon. Their sound is like thunder. Their name is Kui.</p>
<p>Note also: Kui Niu: strange beasts in ancient times, like blue cattle, have no horns on three legs and roar like thunder. Living in the deep sea for a long time, three thousand years is a birth. When born, the wind and rain rise. It is made by thunder and lightning. It&rsquo;s called thunderbolt mount. The term &ldquo;Shanhaijing&rdquo; is used here. (to be continued. )</p>
