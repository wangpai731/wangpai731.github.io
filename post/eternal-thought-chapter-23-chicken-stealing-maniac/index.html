<p>I&rsquo;d like to present today&rsquo;s update. By the way, I&rsquo;d like to draw a vote for the &ldquo;starting point&rdquo; 515 fan Festival. Everyone has 8 tickets. I&rsquo;d like to give you some money to vote for!</p>
<p>Late at night, Xiangyun mountain is shrouded in darkness, and there is no sign of five fingers. Only the wind whimpers and blows across the hill. It seems that even birds and animals are not heard.</p>
<p>In the dark night, Bai Xiaochun took out the silk ribbon given by Zhou Xinqi, tied it to her arm, and went straight along the path to the area where Lingwei chicken was raised. This figure was so fast that she shuttled through the grass and came near.</p>
<p>From afar, you can see the yard of Lingwei chicken. Most of them are resting. Sometimes a few are still walking around, especially one is coming towards here.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun squatted in the grass and licked his lips. After waiting for a moment, when the Lingwei chicken approached, he slowly approached the fence and was about to take out the bamboo cicada, but his mind suddenly moved and his eyes showed vigilance.</p>
<p>At the same time, a low roar suddenly came from not far behind him, and a series of figures burst out in an instant. There were several dazzling fireballs in the night, which were displayed and shining everywhere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn chicken thief, you finally show up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wait here for many days, and I&rsquo;ll see how you can escape!&rdquo; Roar reverberates, the figure of seven or eight in an instant rushed to Bai Xiaochun, surrounded by it.</p>
<p>These seven or eight people are the disciples of raising chickens. They have been waiting for several days, but they didn&rsquo;t expect to have such a harvest today. They all have enough energy in their hearts and have the intention to bring the chicken thief to justice.</p>
<p>But in their words, the figure near the blink of an eye, Bai Xiaochun is first surprised, and then eyes turn, suddenly cold hum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut up, keep your voice down!&rdquo; He was not polite, just words of the mouth, no Dodge, swagger to stand up, specially exposed the silk ribbon on the arm.</p>
<p>This sudden scene made the seven or eight people who rushed to the scene all stunned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you can see, I&rsquo;m the leader of the thief team.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun frowned and looked at the seven or eight people in front of her, showing dissatisfaction on her face. [love to go to the small</p>
<p>Some of the seven or eight disciples had seen Bai Xiaochun in the daytime. They looked at him carefully and hesitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s younger martial brother Bai What are you doing here so late? &quot; One of the seven or eight disciples looked at Bai Xiaochun with suspicion in his eyes. When he asked, the others looked at her with suspicion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since elder martial sister Zhou asked me to be the leader of the thief catching team, Bai must try his best to catch the chicken thief, so he gave up his practice at night and came here to guard. However, if you yell at me, there are chicken thieves and they are scared away.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun frowned, a pair of dedicated to capture the thief, small sleeve a swing, said displeased.</p>
<p>These chicken raising disciples looked at each other one by one, and many of their faces showed embarrassed expressions. The first disciple who suspected Bai Xiaochun just now had less doubt in his eyes, but he still seemed to be skeptical.</p>
<p>Seeing that the other party has not completely dispelled the doubt, Bai Xiaochun snorted coldly. Before the other party asked questions again, he took the lead and showed that he hated iron but not steel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No wonder your spirit tail chicken always loses, you are too careless, you wait to see here, this smash is damaged!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun pointed to the fence behind him. There were some damages, but the damage was not obvious. It was the last time he stole the chicken, the Lingwei chicken was damaged in the struggle.</p>
<p>The chicken raising disciples followed Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s point. After a close look, they all saw the damage of the fence. They were all surprised. They didn&rsquo;t pay much attention to these subtle details before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the spirit tail chicken, all ran over, how did you guard it?&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun is more and more dissatisfied, and her voice is a little louder. The disciples who listen to the chicken are all ashamed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;According to my observation, this is the most remote place in this area, which should be focused on guarding, but I have been here for a long time before you show up.&rdquo; The more Bai Xiaochun said, the more angry she was. At the end of the day, she sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can you catch thieves like this? With my experience in catching thieves, if I guess correctly, you will lose the most chickens here.&rdquo; As soon as he said this, the chicken raising disciples were shocked. They looked at each other and saw the surprise in each other&rsquo;s eyes, because according to their understanding, this is indeed the place where most chickens are lost.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why they stay here. Now they are told by Bai Xiaochun. When people look at Bai Xiaochun one by one, their eyes slowly show their admiration.</p>
<p>Even the former suspicious disciple felt guilty at the moment. Looking at Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s righteous act of seizing thieves at the time of practice for them, he also thought of Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s boundless enthusiasm during the day, so he took a deep breath and bowed deeply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have offended so much before. Don&rsquo;t worry about it. Thank you for your kindness. We will repair this place as soon as possible and focus on protecting it in the future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Other people are also embracing their fists. They feel that Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s enthusiasm here is commendable. They really help them with their heart and apologize for their recklessness.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun sighed and gave a few words of careful advice. After that, he walked away. After him, the seven or eight disciples worshipped again. When they looked at Bai Xiaochun, they were moved by Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s enthusiasm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Younger martial brother Bai is a good man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun has just walked out of this area. When the wind blows, he finds the sweat behind him chilly. He says in his heart that it is dangerous, but he is very hungry. So he thinks about it and decides to go to the other two places to see if there is a chance to start.</p>
<p>Walking along the mountain path, Bai Xiaochun looked around with a serious look. He thought about how to steal the chicken in the next place. The ribbon on his arm was shaking and gradually went away when the wind blew.</p>
<p>At the same time, in the dark air, there was a figure of a woman standing on the blue silk, overlooking the whole Xiangyun mountain. Suddenly, she noticed Bai Xiaochun, who looked left and right. Gradually, the woman&rsquo;s eyes appreciated more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a conscientious and responsible younger martial brother.&rdquo; This woman, of course, is Zhou Xinqi. She has inspected all the areas, and at first she has seen people patrolling. But as the night falls, most of them practice their own ways. Only Bai Xiaochun really goes out to catch the thieves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you want to come to the chicken thief, you will be restrained a lot.&rdquo; Zhou Xinqi takes back her eyes and flies back to the cave.</p>
<p>An hour later, Bai Xiaochun wandered around for a long time. When he came back to his yard, he patted the storage bag, and two Lingwei chickens appeared. He laughed, plucked and arranged them, and threw them into the pot. Soon, the aroma wafted out. Bai Xiaochun swallowed a mouthful of saliva, but did not care about the scalding, and devoured it.</p>
<p>Finally, he burped, patted his stomach and lay on the side, his face intoxicated.</p>
<p>A month passed quickly. In the past month, Bai Xiaochun was quite serious. He often saw his solemn figure in the night and haunted various chicken raising places.</p>
<p>Even so, the chicken was often lost, as if the opposite side had gone without a trace. Those disciples who raised the chicken felt more and more shameless. They encouraged themselves and vowed many times to catch the chicken thief.</p>
<p>When we look at Bai Xiaochun, it seems that he is more conscientious than they are. He guards in a certain area, as if he will not catch the chicken thieves. He even once stayed at a chicken farm for four days and four nights.</p>
<p>The persistent strength seems to form a strong deterrent force, which makes the stealing of chickens less frequent, but it still hasn&rsquo;t completely disappeared. The Lingwei chicken in Xiangyun mountain has been reduced by half, and the rest is not much. Most of them are immature chicks.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, even the chicken raising disciples lamented that they were inferior to each other. They often lamented that if all the disciples of the thief team were the same as younger martial brother Bai, they would surely be able to catch the chicken thief.</p>
<p>Zhou Xinqi was also worried. One afternoon, Bai Xiaochun sat cross legged at the chicken raising place. When she looked around with vigilance, a blue silk came and Zhou Xinqi appeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sister Zhou.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun got up to say hello after seeing it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Younger martial brother Bai has worked hard.&rdquo; Zhou Xinqi looks at Bai Xiaochun with a smile on her face.</p>
<p>Soon, the other disciples of this place also came to gather around Zhou Xinqi, and Bai Xiaochun was also in it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you for your help these days. I&rsquo;m very good at this matter, but the chicken thief is still arrogant. In the next few days, I plan to guard this place with you.&rdquo; Zhou Xinqi opened her mouth in a low voice, and after checking with others, she frowned.</p>
<p>Is it true that the thief and the thief have a holiday? Otherwise, there will be Lingwei chicken in other mountain peaks. This person will not steal it, but will stare at my master&rsquo;s spirit tail chicken! &quot;</p>
<p>When Bai Xiaochun heard this sentence, his eyes brightened and he almost slapped his thigh. He had a very reasonable look that the other side said. He was also seriously thinking about the problem. His eyes could not help looking at the ziding mountain in the distance, and gradually narrowed his small eyes to cover the thief light in the deep part of his eyes.</p>
<p>Zhou Xinqi came here, and soon there were countless admirers around, which made the whole Xiangyun mountain where Lingwei chicken was kept was a sea of people.</p>
<p>Chicken thieves seem to have no place to start, so that the spirit tail chicken in the days after, not a lost.</p>
<p>However, this mysterious chicken thief has already gained a great reputation. He has been called a chicken stealing maniac for a long time. He is very popular among his disciples. He has even been taken out and juxtaposed with the little tortoise to become the two most mysterious people in Xiangyun mountain. Even the outer disciples of Qingfeng mountain and ziding mountain have heard of it.</p>
<p>Zhou Xinqi was also pleased to see the chicken thief disappear. Although the chicken thief was not caught, she remembered Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s seriousness for more than a month, and finally sent someone to send the jade pendant as encouragement.</p>
<p>This matter finally came to an end. Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s conscientiousness and persistence made many other disciples remember Bai baijingjing, a clever and enthusiastic fellow disciple.</p>
