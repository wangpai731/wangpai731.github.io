      <p>After the rain, the dark night finally passed, and the first glimmer of light came out of the sky, quietly sprinkling to the world.</p>
<p>Qingyun Mountain, bamboo peak, or a quiet. Although the disciples are diligent, they will not get up so early. Outside the Shoujing hall, among the eaves and tiles, there is the residual dew left last night, which turns into water drops and slides down intermittently. The bamboo forest in the distance is still as green as ever. When you look at it from a distance, there is still a mountain fog in the bamboo forest, which is floating gently like a gauze.</p>
<p>The gate of the Jing Jing hall is still open as usual. Behind the threshold, the Yellow mantle curled up beside the pillar, offering a long flame of light before the case of the three Ching gods, burning quietly in the morning light.</p>
<p>The chilly morning wind, blowing from the distance, swept over the buildings and pavilions, gently played a turn here in the Shoujing hall, and then blew further. In the wind, came a few clear and sweet birds, this is the only sound in the morning.</p>
<p>This is a very peaceful picture, Taoist fairyland, I do not know how many mornings are spent in this way, do not touch the slightest earthly vulgar. But on such a morning, it was different from the past, and there was an incongruous anomaly.</p>
<p>A wet figure knelt at the door of Shoujing hall. His head was deeply buried between the arms and was close to the ground. The land around him had been drenched by the dripping water from his body, but from his body and clothes, there were still water dripping out and slipping down.</p>
<p>Six feet away from the man&rsquo;s body, on the green brick steps at the gate of Shoujing hall, Tian Buyi&rsquo;s body lies quietly at the door of Shoujing hall. Although there is no life, but Tian is not easy to see, looks very peaceful, there is no painful color on his face, it seems that death is not a very important thing for him.</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi&rsquo;s hands were folded between his chest and abdomen, and his clothes were carefully arranged and neatly put on his body. Besides, there were traces of wet on his clothes, but the water vapor was much better than that of the man kneeling at the foot of the steps. However, there are traces of mud on the clothes everywhere. Although it can be seen that they have been kneaded and cleaned, they can not be cleaned in a hurry. So these traces are still everywhere.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think he cares about it.</p>
<p>The morning wind is still blowing, gently blowing over the top of the big bamboo peak of Qingyun Mountain, blowing over the eaves and green tiles of the Shoujing hall, blowing in front of the Shoujing hall. I feel the chill in the wind.</p>
<p>His body trembled slightly. His body was still weak. However, he still knelt motionless and buried his head deeply in front of the gate of Shoujing hall.</p>
<p>There are all he is familiar with, the pavilions, the statues on the stone steps, even the soil on the ground where he kneels down, and the faint breath from the soil. It&rsquo;s all the pieces in his memory that can&rsquo;t be forgotten for a moment. I don&rsquo;t know how many times he had dreamed of going back to that time and returning to this mountain land. But now, when he comes back, he is still in despair.</p>
<p>Behind the ghostly kneeling figure, walking through a long open space, the place where you can see is the once paradise kitchen of Zhang Xiaofan. Ten years later, a kitchen door made of two boards. It seems that there is still no change, just a few more scars, a few pieces of wood, it seems more vicissitudes.</p>
<p>The kitchen door is open. But it was soon pushed open by a fluffy hand. With a few tiny squeaks, the monkey came to the door and jumped in gently,</p>
<p>Even the furnishings in the kitchen did not seem to have changed. The tables and chairs for eating, cooking and cooking are still in their original places. Xiao Hui&rsquo;s eyes turned, skillfully jumped on the table in the middle of the house, and then looked to the right.</p>
<p>Sure enough, on the right side of the kitchen table, next to the wall, there are a lot of dry thatched grass piled together. A yellow figure is sleeping soundly. From time to time, his mouth and nose still emit &ldquo;Chi Chi Chi&rdquo; sounds. It is the rhubarb that played with Xiao Hui since childhood.</p>
<p>Small ash squatted on the table, tail rolled up, but did not immediately jump forward, good and a long time away from friends to embrace. He just scratched his head, turned to look out of the kitchen door, and then looked at the sleeping rhubarb, which seemed a little hesitant.</p>
<p>At this time, rhubarb, who had been sleeping with his ears down, still had his eyes closed, but his ears suddenly stood up as if he had heard something. Then his head moved and his eyes opened.</p>
<p>What came into view was the familiar figure lying on the table not far away. Rhubarb was startled, but immediately came to his senses. He was totally sleepless. He jumped up happily and called for &ldquo;Wang Wang Wang&rdquo; of Xiao Hui. He jumped over in three or two steps and landed on his back feet. His eyes were full of excitement and his tail wagged.</p>
<p>Xiao Hui grinned and seemed to be infected by rhubarb&rsquo;s emotion. He held the dog&rsquo;s head in his arms and stroked his oily fur.</p>
<p>Rhubarb can&rsquo;t help but use his head against small ash, and then put out his tongue to lick Xiaohui&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>Xiaohui chuckled and jumped off the table, and rhubarb turned back. After a fight, Xiao Hui seemed to think of something, frowned, reached out and patted rhubarb&rsquo;s head, and then pointed to the outside of the kitchen.</p>
<p>Rhubarb looks at Xiaohui and doesn&rsquo;t understand what Xiaohui means. Xiaohui squeaked a few more times and jumped on the back of rhubarb. Rhubarb stepped away and ran out of the kitchen. Looking around, he soon saw a figure kneeling in Shoujing hall.</p>
<p>And that figure, it is clearly familiar with.</p>
<p>Rhubarb couldn&rsquo;t help but get excited. He yelled at the figure &ldquo;Wang Wang Wang&rdquo; for several times. He took a step and strode to the past. His tail wagged all the way. Soon, it ran through the open space and approached the ghost, but in China, rhubarb&rsquo;s feet suddenly smothered, but stopped.</p>
<p>Its eyes crossed the ghostly figure of kneeling at the gate of Shoujing hall and saw the body of Tian Buyi lying on the stone steps outside the hall.</p>
<p>Xiao Hui slipped down from rhubarb&rsquo;s back, ran to the side of GUI Li, touched his head, looked around for a moment, and then squatted on the ground, close to the body of GUI Li.</p>
<p>Rhubarb walked slowly past, stepped up the stone steps, and came to Tian Buyi&rsquo;s side. It looks at Tian Buyi&rsquo;s face for a long time, then sniffs his body, and then sniffs other parts of his body. It&rsquo;s tail in doing so, has been facing the field is not easy to gently shake, finally, rhubarb turned his head, seems to be a little confused. Go to Tian Bu Yi&rsquo;s head, gently rub Tian Bu Yi&rsquo;s face with his head, and emit a low &ldquo;Wuwu&rdquo; sound in his mouth.</p>
<p>Tian Buyi didn&rsquo;t have any reaction.</p>
<p>For a long time, yelling and yelling were not expected. For the last time, he rubbed his hard face with no response. As if he gave up, the yellow dog lay down quietly in front of Tian Buyi. His eyes were still staring at Tian Buyi. As if hoping Tian Buyi would wake up suddenly, he put his head on his front feet. Droop down his ears, nestled in the master is not angry, cold side.</p>
<p>The early morning wind, with the cold of last night, quietly blowing. Under the stone steps, the ghostly body trembled slightly again, but he soon fell into a state of stillness again, and knelt down motionless.</p>
<p>This cold morning, the time is still quietly passing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah</p>
<p>With a light cry, Su Ru woke up from her dream in a cold sweat.</p>
<p>The cloud temples are slightly disordered. Flower looks haggard, she slowly from the table to support the body, last night, she was on this table, quietly fell asleep.</p>
<p>The closed window leaf loosened a little, and a light of the morning came into the room through the gap. Su Ru looked at the light for a long time. When she was calm, she gave a slight bitter smile. He turned his eyes and pulled a small round mirror on the table.</p>
<p>In the mirror, her beautiful face appeared, even though she missed and stayed up late. It seems a little haggard, but the demeanor that emanates from her face is still moving.</p>
<p>Face is not old, heart?</p>
<p>She looked at herself in the mirror for a long time, sighed and pressed the small round mirror on the table. Then he got up and went to the window. He reached out and opened the door completely.</p>
<p>The morning light suddenly poured into the room, driving away all the darkness, making people feel one shock. Su Ru&rsquo;s face showed a faint smile, facing the window, slowly stretched a stretch.</p>
<p>Morning wind blowing on the face of the feeling, but also with some faint chill.</p>
<p>She opened the door and went out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still early in the day. It must be that all the disciples have not got up. Let&rsquo;s just let them sleep a little longer. Later, they will be told to go down the mountain to look for it. It is estimated that some of them are tired.</p>
<p>Su Ru thought so in her heart and walked towards the front hall of Shoujing hall.</p>
<p>The winding cloister extends slowly at the foot of the corridor. Outside the corridor, the bamboo is swaying in the morning wind, making a rustling sound. I don&rsquo;t know why, Su Ru in such an early morning, but found that he usually ignored a lot of things.</p>
<p>The paint on the veranda railings is mottled and peeled, and many places have fallen off. I remember the last time I renovated Shoujing hall, when I and Tian were not easy to get married, unconsciously, this corridor accompanied me through countless years, but I didn&rsquo;t realize that my farmland had passed through here. It&rsquo;s not easy to wait for Tian to come back. We must let him paint it again sometime.</p>
<p>There is also the thickest Xiuzhu in the bamboo forest outside the railing. You can see two small swords carved on the bamboo body. They were carved on the green bamboo with the joy of their wedding. I hope they can combine the two swords and practice the immortal way together.</p>
<p>I remember at that time, Tian Buyi had a joke carved ugly, pretended to be angry, and immediately he was anxious to die, coax a long time to let him off.</p>
<p>At that time, the scene is still fresh in my mind. Su Ru&rsquo;s mouth shows a trace of smile and is in a good mood. She took a deep breath of the slightly sweet morning air and went on. Later, she thought that rhubarb was not easy to raise since childhood. After so many days, she did not know whether the disciples had taken good care of it. If she was not careful, she would have to complain about others if she was hungry and thin.</p>
<p>Su Ru smiles and shakes her head, and decides to go to the kitchen to see rhubarb while it&rsquo;s still early. She thought along the way, unconsciously, she went to the front hall of Shoujing hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first sound of the bell in the morning comes from afar. It is the signal of the morning rising of Qingyun gate and the sound of awakening the new day. The sound of the bell and tripod was deep and heavy, reverberating in the mountains for a long time.</p>
<p>Su Ru&rsquo;s heart seemed to jump with the sound.</p>
<p>In front of the Shoujing hall, there are figures, kneeling or lying down. However, rhubarb, who always likes to sleep late, is getting up so early today, and he is lying on the stone steps at the gate of Shoujing hall, listless.</p>
<p>As if he heard something, rhubarb&rsquo;s drooping ears moved, his head turned around and looked at the Shoujing hall. I don&rsquo;t know when a woman stood in the shadow that the morning light had not yet fully illuminated. Just staring at it.</p>
<p>Su Ru&rsquo;s heart, I don&rsquo;t know why, jumps faster and faster, and even seems to explode, which makes her feel like she can&rsquo;t breathe. The figure lying quietly on the stone steps of Shoujing hall. Familiar as if engraved in the depths of her soul, in any case can not erase the shadow.</p>
<p>But at the moment, she prayed in her heart for thousands of times that she was wrong, she was wrong</p>
<p>She was as white as paper. Feet such as filled with lead, step by step slowly walk past, lips are also slightly shaking. Lying beside Tian Buyi, rhubarb looks at Su Ru&rsquo;s walking figure. Her tail gently shakes to her, but she buries her head on the ground again, gazing silently at the hungry master lying in front of her.</p>
<p>Approaching, and finally close to the place that can no longer escape. Tian Bu Yi&rsquo;s familiar face was reflected in Su Ru&rsquo;s eyes. He seemed to be asleep, quietly asleep.</p>
<p>Su Ru just felt a whirl. At the foot of a stagger, actually fell to the ground.</p>
<p>Fortunately, she managed to stabilize her body, Rao was so deep that she turned black and her feet were weak. She went to Tian Bu Yi&rsquo;s body and sat down.</p>
<p>Trembling hands, slowly stroking over the body of Tian Buyi, clothes, through the chest of tianbuyi. Su Ru&rsquo;s hand pauses for a moment, trembles more fiercely, then, the corner of her eye slowly shed two lines of clear tears. Drop by drop, fell on the face of the field is not easy.</p>
<p>At her side, rhubarb issued a &ldquo;whine&rdquo; whine, put his head together, in her legs, gently rub.</p>
<p>She looked up slowly. Looking at the figure kneeling under the stone steps, and the grey haired monkey beside the figure, after a long time, she lowered herself and sobbed and said, &ldquo;you are Xiao Fan</p>
<p>His body trembled and didn&rsquo;t raise his head. On the contrary, his head was buried lower, even tightly on the rough ground. The soil sharpened his skin. At first, he seemed unconscious. After a while, he heard his shaking voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes Disciple , teacher Mother</p>
<p>Su Ru said with a sad smile, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t have to. Get up and talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li knelt down on the ground, did not look up, as if he had lost all his courage. He did not dare to look at Su Ru again, and said in a low voice: &ldquo;the most important thing for me is that I should die. No I didn&rsquo;t protect Shifu from all aspects&hellip; &quot; His voice was intermittent, like every word he said, which was a punishment to him.</p>
<p>Su Ru slowly raised Tian Bu Yi&rsquo;s upper body and hugged him in his arms. Her body trembled slightly, I don&rsquo;t know whether it is because she felt the cold of Tian Bu Yi&rsquo;s body, or she thought that she would use her own warmth to warm her cold body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get up.&rdquo; Her voice sounded empty and desolate. In the ghostly memory, she never used the tone that Su Ru had been so powerless and helpless. However, this discovery only made him more painful. He could not help but move his face slowly in the sand so that the pain on the surface could disperse his heart which was about to explode.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t you get up and tell me Su Ru said faintly, but her eyes only looked at the body in her arms, which had already been unconscious, as if at this moment, her eyes could no longer accommodate other things.</p>
<p>Rhubarb climbed forward two steps and rubbed his hard body with his head. His voice was low and low.</p>
<p>GUI Li&rsquo;s body pauses for a while, slowly straightens up, raises the head, looks at Su Ru.</p>
<p>That dignified and beautiful woman, even in this heart dead moment, seems to have never lost her demeanor. In the morning wind, her slight undulating hair floats on her temples, with her white cheek pasted on Tian Bu Yi&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re back, you&rsquo;re home at last&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is the last word that Gui Li heard Su Ru say.</p>
<p>Then, his chest suddenly surged with Qi and blood, which rolled up like a turbulent wave. Then he saw the darkness in front of him. It was like a tight string in his mind that had been stretched to death and broke away in an instant.</p>
<p>He &ldquo;plops&rdquo; a sound, like a board fell to the ground, fainted.</p>
<p>At the moment before he was about to lose consciousness, he felt as if his whole body had been burned by fire, but his body was as cold as ice. In the distance, there were a few shouts, which were full of fear and pain. After a while, they turned into a cry.</p>
<p>Disorderly footstep rings everywhere, but all come in one direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Teacher! Teacher Niang&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>The silent cry was the last and only thought that flashed through the ghost&rsquo;s mind, and then he was no longer conscious. (to be continued. )</p>
