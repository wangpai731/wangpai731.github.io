      <p>It was not easy to shake the dirt under his feet. Zhang Xiaofan turned around and saw that the little girl had come to the old man&rsquo;s side. At the moment, she said something gently to the old man. The old man listened, nodded slightly and smiled.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan blushed, wondering if they were laughing at him there, hesitated for a moment, or walked over and said, &ldquo;old gentleman, what do you mean when you just said I have a fierce face?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man narrowed his eyes and looked at him, smiled a little, and said: &ldquo;although your heaven is full, your cheeks are thin, so you should not be a rich man, right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan suddenly believed three more points to him and nodded: &ldquo;the old man is right. I come from a peasant family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man smiled, patted his robe gently, and said calmly, &ldquo;I still see that your eyebrows are thick and straight, but there is a small mole at the end of your right eyebrow. I&rsquo;m afraid that your parents respect your parents. I&rsquo;m afraid your father and your mother are no longer alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was surprised and believed three points again. He nodded repeatedly and said, &ldquo;you are so wise, old man. My parents have died since I was a child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man smiled and said, &ldquo;why don&rsquo;t you show me your hand again, little brother</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan has already believed seven or eight points in his heart at the moment. When hearing this, he put out his hand. The old man smiled and was about to watch. Unexpectedly, the little girl beside him suddenly came back and grabbed Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s hand. Zhang Xiaofan was shocked, but he saw that the little girl looked at him like her grandfather. He smiled and ran away again, but Zhang Xiaofan left behind It&rsquo;s very uncomfortable to have a couple of candy bars.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan stayed for a while, but he could not scold the child, so he had to admit his misfortune. At this time, the old man handed over a handkerchief and said with a smile, &ldquo;my husband and granddaughter are naughty. Don&rsquo;t blame me, little brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan smiled bitterly and wiped the handkerchief on his hand. Looking up, I saw that the old man and granddaughter were standing together again, talking and laughing. I didn&rsquo;t know what they were talking about.</p>
<p>Seeing Zhang Xiaofan, the old man smiled and said, &ldquo;OK. Then let me look at the palms for my little brother? &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan stretched out his hand in accordance with the words, but his eyes were always staring at the little girl for fear of being confused by her again. However, at this time, the little girl seemed very quiet, just watching Zhang Xiaofan giggle. I don&rsquo;t know what she&rsquo;s laughing at?</p>
<p>The old man looked for a moment, and suddenly his face changed, &ldquo;oops.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was surprised and said, &ldquo;how?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man didn&rsquo;t talk much either. He just pointed at Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s palm and said, &ldquo;little brother, do you see this life line?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan took a look at it. Naturally, he didn&rsquo;t know what the mystery was. He said blankly, &ldquo;what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man looked dignified and said: &ldquo;I see your life line. Not like ordinary people, there is a big shortage at the beginning. When you are young, there must be a big difficulty, which is very deep and huge. Most of your relatives and friends are also involved in it, and the vitality is slim! In this way, I&rsquo;m afraid that most of your father and mother died in this disaster. &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s heart was sour. At the moment, he believed in the old man completely. He said in an astringent voice, &ldquo;old man, you are a living immortal. That&rsquo;s all right. &quot;</p>
<p>The old man sighed, and then said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s so hard that you can&rsquo;t escape, but you&rsquo;re lucky. In this position of great shortage, there is a &ldquo;jade new grid&rdquo; framed to make it continuous and vital, which is also a great fortune in misfortune. &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s face of general wisdom suddenly appeared in his heart at the moment, and he was silent for a moment. He bit his teeth and said, &ldquo;today, the old man said that I am still in a bad mood. I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going on. Please teach me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man smiled, suddenly coughed twice, and said: &ldquo;this, this&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was surprised and said, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter, old man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man smiled and said: &ldquo;to tell you the truth, when I was a monk, I set up a rule that people must accept money when they look at each other, so&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan wakes up and says: &ldquo;please tell me, how much is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man looked at him with a smile and said, &ldquo;Twelve grains of silver at a time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan originally stretched his hand to his waist, smelled and said: &ldquo;it is so expensive, but I only have 42 silver in total.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man frowned, and then said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s all. Four Liang is four Liang. I&rsquo;m related to my little brother today, so I should help you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was very grateful. Anyway, he didn&rsquo;t have much use in putting silver on his body. He was able to deal with it in the wild. Now he gave four liang of silver to the old man.</p>
<p>The old man put away the silver, straightened his face, and looked at Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s face carefully. He said: &ldquo;little brother, I see that your printing hall is black and the dark clouds cover the roof. Obviously, it&rsquo;s not good luck. There must be many difficulties and dangers in the future. It&rsquo;s better to turn around. All of these will be solved naturally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was surprised and said, &ldquo;is that it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man nodded, &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan hesitated: &ldquo;but I have something urgent to go to the East&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Old man advised: &ldquo;little brother, what can be more important than your own life, or turn back.&rdquo; Finish saying, one arch of both hands, way, &ldquo;meet in the Jianghu, it&rsquo;s fate, there will be another meeting in the future, we&rsquo;ll leave here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan frowned, nodded blankly, and saw that the old and the young were far away. At the moment, he was in the stream of people, but he seemed to lose his way and didn&rsquo;t know where he was.</p>
<p>Turning the corner of the street, the old man and the little girl hide at the same time, turn around and lean out a little head to look at Zhang Xiaofan, only to see the young man standing in the flow of people, a little confused on his face, after a while, he turned around and walked forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha ha, another four liang of silver.&rdquo; The old man suddenly changed his face, took out the silver in his waist and looked at it carefully. He laughed all the time, but the little girl&rsquo;s face was calm, glanced at him, and said, &ldquo;Grandpa, how can you do this again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man laughed and put away the money. He smiled at his granddaughter and said, &ldquo;Xiaohuan, I didn&rsquo;t give birth to your granddaughter in vain. I can tell the first half of my life when I&rsquo;m less than ten years old. In time, I must be the outstanding person in my physiognomy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little girl named Xiaohuan snorted and said, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s so hard to understand about those superficial comic books? It&rsquo;s your grandpa who didn&rsquo;t work hard in the past, but he said it&rsquo;s OK!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It turns out that the two of them, who are really capable, are the little girl. They read Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s life and told her grandpa in time.</p>
<p>The old man obviously dotes on the granddaughter. She said that she didn&rsquo;t care. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look down on the comic books that Grandpa showed you,&rdquo; nine calculations of life principle &ldquo;and&rdquo; Yu Zhu Xiangxue &ldquo;, which were handed down by our ancestor, Zong qingyunzi. That is to say, you are gifted with intelligence. You have a unique talent for this kind of physiognomy. You have changed ordinary people. Ha ha, for example, Grandpa and I.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going on! &quot;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan spat at him, turned around, but saw that Zhang Xiaofan had already disappeared. Turning around, she said, &ldquo;what did you say about his difficult future?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man smiled and said, &ldquo;naturally I lied to him, but you can see how he looks and future, but there is a real disaster?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan shook her head and said, &ldquo;I can only see the &lsquo;past life&rsquo; and the &lsquo;future life&rsquo; only touches the skin. I&rsquo;m not sure! &quot;</p>
<p>The old man nodded his head and said, &ldquo;yes, the past is fixed number, which can&rsquo;t be changed. It&rsquo;s natural and beautiful. The future is unknown. It&rsquo;s the highest level of my Xiangxue, which is so easy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan shrugged her shoulders, walked forward with her grandfather, and said, &ldquo;but as far as I know, that man&rsquo;s face and destiny seem very strange. It&rsquo;s the most difficult life number recorded in the comic book -&rdquo; random devil life &ldquo;. It&rsquo;s very rare. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No matter him, anyway, the silver is in hand. Come on, Grandpa will take you to have a meal&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cut by the way. Grandpa, when you mentioned the ancestor of qingyunzi just now, don&rsquo;t you often say that we share the same lineage with qingyunmen? Why don&rsquo;t we recognize each other? Take qingyunmen&rsquo;s current status and your rank.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to eat hot food or drink hot food. You can choose whatever you like? &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shhh&hellip;&rdquo; The old man was startled. He looked around and saw that no one was paying attention. Then he put his heart down and whispered, &ldquo;little girl, what do you know? Qingyun gate is now a famous sect of cultivation. What we know is just a little bit of the original phase study of Qingyun&rsquo;s founder. We are afraid that they will be regarded as fraudsters and have been locked up on Qingyun Mountain for one or two hundred years, Besides</p>
<p>He smiled faintly, and his expression showed the spirit of the crane bone fairy when he talked with Zhang Xiaofan just now. He said: &ldquo;I am not that kind of person who likes to follow the trend on Monday!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan was stunned for a moment and said happily, &ldquo;Grandpa, I didn&rsquo;t expect that you still have this kind of backbone. It&rsquo;s really difficult&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before she finished speaking, she just listened to the light in the eyes of the immortal on Monday. She stepped out step by step and stopped a fat woman with a face of Futai and gold and silver wearing in the street. She said positively, &ldquo;madam, I see that you cover the roof with black clouds, the printing hall is black, and your face is dead. It&rsquo;s not good! Why don&rsquo;t you ask me to add a picture for you? &quot;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan is dumb, but she sees grandpa winking at her, so she has to follow her again, pretend to be cute and naive, and look at the rich and fat woman&rsquo;s face carefully.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan walked through the street and walked out of the small town unconsciously. After a delay in that town, he had his own thoughts. At this time, he found that it was dusk.</p>
<p>The setting sun slanted, printing the sky sunset like fire, also pulled his figure long. It&rsquo;s dinner time now. Every family walks home. There&rsquo;s no one outside the town. He&rsquo;s alone. He&rsquo;s very lonely.</p>
<p>Looking at his own shadow, he felt a sense of loss again.</p>
<p>Since he heard that ten thousand people said that the orthodox cultivation sects would go to the East Sea and wave mountain, he guessed that most of the Shifu Tianyi would also go there. He had the intention to go there and get together, but today he met an &ldquo;old fairy&rdquo; and pointed out that he could not go there, but would he go back to Qingyun Mountain? In case that all the disciples were not there, what would he do?</p>
<p>He got out of the dead spirit abyss of kongsang mountain. He thought that he would see his master and his mother earlier to report peace. But these days, he was full of thoughts, so he was slow. But now he had to turn around suddenly, but he couldn&rsquo;t make up his mind.</p>
<p>At the moment when he hesitated, he suddenly heard a sound of footsteps behind him. Turning around, he saw that it was the huge stone. He was walking out of the town alone.</p>
<p>I saw him go to a nearby place, listen to him, look at Zhang Xiaofan, and don&rsquo;t care. I just look at the sunset in the West and say to myself, &ldquo;the sun is in the West. Well, the mayor said that Blackstone cave is ten miles north of the town, that&rsquo;s the direction.&rdquo; Find the right direction. It looks like he&rsquo;s going to walk.</p>
<p>When Zhang Xiaofan heard this, he felt a movement in his heart and said: &ldquo;stone Do you want to go to Blackstone cave, warrior? &quot;</p>
<p>Stone stunned for a moment. Stop, turn around and look at Zhang Xiaofan, and say, &ldquo;exactly, who are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s mind turned. I thought: since I can&rsquo;t go to the East, it&rsquo;s better to get rid of the demons before I go with this man. In the future, Shifu asked me that I made a virtue of my own, so I can explain it to Shifu.</p>
<p>The idea is fixed. Then he said with a smile: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m also a man of cultivation. I look at everything in Xiaochi town in the daytime. I wanted to kill the villagers like you, but I was delayed. But fortunately, I still have time. I don&rsquo;t know if you would like to join me, brother? &quot;</p>
<p>Stone big eyes up and down looked at Zhang Xiaofan, urn sound urn airway: &ldquo;there is not fun, which is quite a risk, I see you are not old, is the path of which door?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was stunned for a moment, and saw that the stone itself was not old. Moreover, he was born with a simple, honest and simple mind, and could say such words unexpectedly. Unexpectedly, he smiled and said: &ldquo;I worship in the first field of the bamboo peak of Qingyun gate, where it&rsquo;s not easy to sit, and I&rsquo;m not easy to walk. Please take care of brother Shi.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stone a surprised, open eyes, surprised way: &ldquo;what, you unexpectedly is under the Qingyun gate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan nodded, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was envy in stone&rsquo;s eyes and he said, &ldquo;ah. Disrespect. Qingyun sect is the most important school of cultivating the truth in the world. It has long been said that Qingyun Taoism is profound and marvelous, which is respected by the world. If you offend just now, forgive me a lot. &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan stayed for a while. But I was very happy for a while. I didn&rsquo;t expect that my school had such a great reputation outside. Then I laughed and said, &ldquo;brother Shi, I&rsquo;m flattered. It&rsquo;s better for us to go there together, or take care of many people when we do harm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stone ha ha a smile, way: &ldquo;good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Blackstone cave is in a forest ten miles north of Xiaochi town. Along the way, Zhang Xiaofan and stone talk to each other through their names. Zhang Xiaofan has a simple temperament and a huge stone body, but his temperament is not overbearing. Like his face, he is also a simple and honest type. The two people agreed to each other and soon called each other by their names.</p>
<p>At this time, the sky has gradually darkened, and the afterglow of the sun is faintly sprinkled on the earth.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan looked at the trees in front of him. He thought that the woods were coming soon. He called out, &ldquo;brother Shi.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stone answered him, &ldquo;what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan said: &ldquo;I saw that golden mace magic weapon you offered in the daytime. It&rsquo;s solemn, and the formula seems to belong to the school of Buddhism. Although I heard that there is no such magic weapon as mace in Buddhism, I always think it&rsquo;s like the treasure in Buddhism, don&rsquo;t you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a flash of admiration in stone&rsquo;s eyes, and he said: &ldquo;Xiaofan, you are worthy of being a disciple of Qingyun sect. You are really knowledgeable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan blushed.</p>
<p>Stone said again: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Ding Danbo, a Vajra man. For generations, I&rsquo;ve been a single biography. My master, the great venerable, met me in a remote village. He said that I&rsquo;m a man of simple material, just strong and thick. It&rsquo;s just a person who is good at practicing his Vajra method, so I&rsquo;m a man of practice. His old man once told me that the Vajra gate has something to do with Buddhism, but it&rsquo;s too old for anyone to remember. Moreover, the Dharma formula has been passed down from generation to generation, which is quite different. It&rsquo;s incomparable with today&rsquo;s authentic Buddhism, the true Tianyin temple. &quot;</p>
<p>Speaking of this, shitoudun gave a simple smile on his face and said: &ldquo;but my Shifu also said that although we have a low level of Taoism, we also lack the discipline of Buddhism. People who practice Taoism naturally want to do merit and virtue for the world, so if they encounter evils, they should do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan admired him and said, &ldquo;ah, your master is really a master!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stone nodded: &ldquo;yes, my master is very decent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan smiles and doesn&rsquo;t speak, but at the moment, his heart suddenly moves. He somehow remembers what he talked with thousands of people that day. He thinks to himself: if someone like the master of stone knows that my magic weapon is such a evil thing, he may not allow his apprentice to be with me, right?</p>
<p>In other words, it&rsquo;s the first elder in Qingyun sect. I&rsquo;m afraid that he will hate such evil things!</p>
<p>What about the person who used the evil thing?</p>
<p>Is it true that I am already a member of the heresy</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was silent. Stone thought that he was going to the black stone cave. He was preparing and didn&rsquo;t care. He also checked his body and prepared to fight against the monster.</p>
<p>It was dark at last.</p>
<p>When the first star peeped out of the sky, the two of them arrived outside a small forest.</p>
<p>The stone breathed deeply, and said to Zhang Xiaofan, &ldquo;I heard the mayor say that the black stone cave is in this forest. The cave is rich in black stone. In the past, the villagers often came here to dig and build roads. Now, naturally, it has not come. It&rsquo;s said that the hole extends down and is unfathomable. We need to be careful. &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan nodded and said: &ldquo;no matter how deep it is, there is no room for the deep dead spirit under the wanbat Grottoes in sangshan mountain.&rdquo;. Now they are going to step into this dangerous place when they reorganize their clothes. Suddenly, at this time, ten feet away, there is a slight cry of panic:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both of them were stunned. In a blink of an eye, Zhang Xiaofan was shocked at once. He saw two people running from the right, one old and one young, not the two grandsons who were fortune tellers during the day. At the moment, I see that the little girl is OK, but the old man is breathless. Where is the shadow of crane bone fairy wind?</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan went up and stopped in front of them, saying, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter, gentlemen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Monday, Xianzheng was running anxiously. Suddenly, someone appeared in front of her eyes. She was startled and fixed her eyes. It was the silly boy in the daytime. Then she gave up her mind and looked back. But when she saw the road was quiet and there was no personal shadow, she took a long breath and stopped. She said to her granddaughter Xiaohuan, &ldquo;Xiaohuan, stop running. It seems that the man has not come after her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan gasps for breath, but she still has a bunch of ice sugar gourd in her hand. It seems that she loves such sweet food very much. When she heard the words of Monday fairy, she ran forward for a while, and then she stopped. She kept breathing.</p>
<p>Stone also came over at this time, standing beside Zhang Xiaofan, looking at the old and young like a bereaved dog, surprised: &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan has the same question, but before he opens his mouth, he hears that Xiaohuan has already complained loudly: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s all Grandpa you, it&rsquo;s not enough to cheat that fat woman, but I went to see that young woman. I saw it early in the morning. She is so smart. Where did we cheat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Monday, the fairy said angrily, &ldquo;well, you didn&rsquo;t tell me earlier. I was slapped by the woman, and still hurt. If I didn&rsquo;t have the secret art of hiding, I would have&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>Voice did not fall, all of a sudden, I heard a clear rebuke in the night sky: &ldquo;old liar, where are you going!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everyone was shocked, only to see a white light like electricity, like the refraction of the air, straight to Monday fairy.</p>
<p>On Monday, the immortal would not have practiced any Dharma, but he was caught off guard. Even some of the other disciples could not make it, they would be hit by the white light.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan looked aside. After all, he thought about some friendship. He couldn&rsquo;t help it. In a hurry, although he heard what they said just now, he felt as if he had been cheated by the two of them, but at this moment, he didn&rsquo;t think so much about it. He waved and rushed out with the firebrand, such as the electric gun, which blocked him for a while.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bang&rdquo;, a loud sound, white light was blocked back, the air came a slightly surprised female voice, then white light across, a woman fell in front of everyone.</p>
<p>After a while, Zhang Xiaofan was still in a daze, only to see the woman in green clothes, with a small gold bell hanging around her waist, ringing clear and crisp, and a white flower between her fingers, crystal clear as jade. At the moment, her face seemed to be smiling. She did not look at the old man Monday Xianna for a long time. Her eyes were only on Zhang Xiaofan, and she said with a light smile, &ldquo;what a coincidence, Zhang Xiaofan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not that devil cult girl. Who is Biyao? (to be continued. )</p>
