      <p>Not only did Zheng Yuandong notice Bai Xiaochun. After all, other people were in an uproar, but Bai Xiaochun stood beside the statue and posed as an elder. The temperament of the whole person was different, especially obvious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bai Xiaochun has also reached the eighth floor of condensate gas, and even died in the first battle of the Luochen family. I think this son must be in the top ten today, and even hope to compete for the top five.&rdquo; The elder on the high platform opened his mouth with a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. He has excellent attainments in grass and trees, and his body training method is amazing. Maybe he can become a dark horse in this qualification battle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Listening to people&rsquo;s words, Li Qinghou and Zheng Yuandong both felt a light on their faces, and they both laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This child is not the same as others. His faith is far from that of his peers. When I took him up the mountain, I asked him why he practiced. He told me that he wanted to live forever.&rdquo; Li Qinghou said with a smile. When he looked at Bai Xiaochun, his eyes showed softness. He had bought a magic weapon for Bai Xiaochun and was ready to give it to him after the qualification war.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We should not continue to praise him. Although this child is my younger brother, we can understand that he has a bad character and needs to be honed. However, he has a pure and good nature and does not like high-profile personality, which is commendable.&rdquo; The leader opened his mouth with a smile. Though he said so, people could see the expectation of Zheng Yuandong.</p>
<p>When people are laughing on the high platform, Bai Xiaochun stands beside a statue in the square. He looks at Lu Tianlei, who is aloof and arrogant. He also looks at Shangguan Tianyou, who has caused countless shrieks.</p>
<p>The lightning all over LV Tianlei&rsquo;s body makes Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s scalp numb. He remembers the scene when he was struck by thunder some days ago. The blessing of Shangguan Tianyou and the ancient sword are not vulgar, and his whole body seems to be startling, which makes Bai Xiaochun take a breath.</p>
<p>He thinks these two people are really tough.</p>
<p>But at the thought of his identity, Bai Xiaochun quickly coughed and nodded with a smile again, showing appreciation in his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The more Tianjiao is, the stronger our Lingxi sect will be. I am the glorious disciple and the leader&rsquo;s younger brother. I can&rsquo;t compare with them. They are the future of the sect. I can&rsquo;t bully them. Well, I have to wait for Tianjiao to enter the inner gate!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun made up her mind and looked very pleased.</p>
<p>Gradually, more and more people came. However, all the outer disciples of the 8th floor of condensate gas were good at their fists, and some of them had not achieved their accomplishments, but they naturally wanted to watch and observe the grand event of qualification war.</p>
<p>There are thousands of disciples in the three mountains on the south bank and eight layers of condensing gas. At the moment, all of them are gathered in this valley. Among them, Bai Xiaochun has never seen many of them. After all, not all people like to be lively, but many people like to be alone and unknown. They have the idea of making a big splash by making use of the grand event like today.</p>
<p>Around, there are more and more disciples from outside. Their accomplishments can&rsquo;t participate in the qualification war. At the moment, they just wait and see, one by one, looking forward to thousands of eight layers of condensate gas disciples. Everyone&rsquo;s heart is waiting. In the next qualification war, who can rank in the top 100 and who can enter the top ten.</p>
<p>As for the top three, there is no suspense in everyone&rsquo;s eyes. It must be Shangguan Tianyou, LV Tianlei and Zhou Xinqi, and even the ranking is the same.</p>
<p>Gradually, as thousands of students on the eighth floor of condensing gas became quiet, all the students watching around were silent. When a depressing atmosphere gradually enveloped, the sense of killing became more intense because of the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>As if the pressure of all people are out of breath, the heart began to tense.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun was surprised to find that he was also a little nervous. He was puzzled and said that he had no plan to compare with him. He looked around and shook his body to relax.</p>
<p>At this time, the voice of Li Qinghou on the platform suddenly spread and reverberated in all directions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On both sides of the Taiwan Straits, a big match is about to be held!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of you have always been alone, and their real strength is unknown. This time, it&rsquo;s your chance to show yourself. Don&rsquo;t worry that your cultivation will be promoted too fast, or there may be some special nature. Cultivation is a private matter. Everyone has secrets. It&rsquo;s no accident that our Lingxi sect has developed from a small sect to the present day for thousands of years Each has its own nature. You can get it. It&rsquo;s your destiny! &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are some of you who are called Tianjiao, but they only rely on their talent. There are lots of people with good talent, but there are many losers in the end. Today, let&rsquo;s prove whether you are really worthy of the name as others call you Heaven is proud Li Qinghou&rsquo;s voice was deep and passionate. It seemed to resonate with the sense of killing around him, which made everyone in the valley breathe quickly.</p>
<p>In particular, those who have their own secrets, one by one, show the essence.</p>
<p>Even Lu Tianlei and others raised their heads one by one, and their faces were full of fighting spirit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this qualification battle, the top 100 will be promoted to inner disciples, and the top 10 will represent Nan&rsquo;an to participate in the Dabi. This is a great event for half a year, and this is also a time for half a year. Let the north bank students remember your opportunity!&rdquo; Li Qinghou&rsquo;s big sleeve swung and the world roared. At this moment, all the three mountains on the south bank burst out a light column and rose into the sky.</p>
<p>Earth shaking, the sky rolling, like a pair of invisible hands, tearing the void, so that the valley side of the exit, actually turned out a bridge!</p>
<p>The bridge is ancient and simple. It seems that there have been countless years. The stones that make up the bridge are shining with Ancient Runes.</p>
<p>The bridge is a hundred feet wide, and you can&rsquo;t see the end at a glance. It suddenly appears as if it stands between heaven and earth. Compared with this bridge, this originally majestic Valley is just an entrance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This bridge is called Lingxi bridge. It&rsquo;s a treasure of our Lingxi sect. Please come here now. As your way of trial, all disciples of the eighth layer of condensate gas will step into the bridge after the nine bells ring!&rdquo; It was no longer Li Qinghou, but Xu Meixiang, who stood up from the high platform. She looked very beautiful. Now she looked solemn. Standing there, her clothes were blowing and her long hair was dancing. She looked like a fairy, not like a woman in the world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The quickest one to reach the end is the first, and so on. Choose the top ten and the first hundred disciples to come out!&rdquo; With Xu Meixiang&rsquo;s words echoing, all the disciples around were in a state of agitation and looked at the bridge one by one.</p>
<p>This method of competition is to investigate the comprehensive quality, and there is no rule that does not allow people to fight. That is to say, as long as the immortal, whatever method can reach the end as soon as possible, is the first!</p>
<p>And it can be imagined that there will be some obstacles on this bridge, and even luck is very likely to become a kind of strength.</p>
<p>At the same time, Bai Xiaochun gasped in the crowd. At this moment, the bell rang.</p>
<p>One, two, three Four, five, six</p>
<p>The sound of the bell spread and struck in the minds of all the disciples who participated in the qualification war. Everyone&rsquo;s heart was raised, and the cultivation in the body was running faster and faster. One by one, the momentum was all ready.</p>
<p>Until seven, eight When the ninth bell rang, the roar rose to the sky. The thousands of disciples with eight levels of condensation gas and almost everyone&rsquo;s cultivation broke out in this instant. Each body was like an arrow leaving the string and burst out in an instant!</p>
<p>Thousands of people galloped, and many more flew directly to the ancient bridge in front of them. In the blink of an eye, someone stepped onto the bridge and galloped away. Shangguan Tianyou has the fastest speed. The sword is flying under your feet. The whole person turns into a green rainbow. He is the first one!</p>
<p>Behind him is Lu Tianlei. He seems to have the power to attract and repel. He is second only to Shangguan Tianyou. His eyes are red and his voice is faster.</p>
<p>The third is Zhou Xinqi. The blue silk under her feet shakes rapidly and moves forward rapidly.</p>
<p>There are still a few people in the rear. They are all strangers. Obviously, it is just what Li Qinghou said that they usually cover up their accomplishments. At this moment, they did not cover up any more. They broke out with all their strength. All of a sudden, they pulled many people out of the rear. They even could see that they had more strength.</p>
<p>At the moment, I watched all around.</p>
<p>Can be in this public attention, the square, with all the crazy rush out, soon left only white Xiaochun standing there alone.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun blinked, almost the moment of the ninth bell, he felt the wind sweeping, and there was no one around him. In front of him, thousands of people rushed to the stone bridge. This scene was very spectacular, and he was amazed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on Bai Xiaochun shouts in the square. He shakes his body, trots all the way to the stone bridge. He has made up his mind that he will participate in the qualification war and not rob the top ten hundred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the north bank, I heard that they were old and fierce, so the fool went to fight them.&rdquo; Bai xiaochunmei is Zizi and looks like he should not be beaten. As for the promotion of inner disciples, he is even more indifferent. He thinks that he is already a glorious disciple and a leader&rsquo;s younger brother. Who cares about the identity of an inner disciple.</p>
<p>So at the moment, while looking at the scenery, from time to time cheering, and other people on the stone bridge, formed a very striking contrast.</p>
<p>All the disciples who watched around were silly. They looked at Bai Xiaochun and looked strange.</p>
<p>On the stage, Li Qinghou&rsquo;s forehead was bulging with blue tendons, staring at Bai Xiaochun, only to feel a burst of Qi in his brain.</p>
<p>Xu Meixiang and the palm seat of Qingfeng mountain were both stunned. They looked at each other and laughed bitterly. As for the elders around, they all opened their eyes. They didn&rsquo;t expect that such a scene would appear in the qualification battle.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s just other disciples, they can reprimand them. But Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s identity is so special that they can&rsquo;t help but look at Li Qinghou and Zheng Yuandong.</p>
<p>Zheng Yuandong has a headache at the moment, which is even more embarrassing. He feels too shameful Now a dry cough, looked at the circumference of the side of the old one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elder Zhou, I don&rsquo;t see anything about the next thing. Your Phoenix is really pitiful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the elder Zhou heard the speech, he immediately understood it. Suddenly, his face was gloomy, and his body suddenly flew out. He roared at Bai Xiaochun on the stone bridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bai Xiaochun, no one can save you today. After I catch you, I will let you personally experience the bitterness of my Phoenix that day!&rdquo; He said, body like a big bird, straight to the stone bridge.</p>
