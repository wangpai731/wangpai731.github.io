      <p>Qingyun Mountain, xiaozhufeng.</p>
<p>It has been three days since Tian Buyi&rsquo;s body was sent back to dazhufeng by the ghost. However, Su Ru is still strangely preventing the disciples of dazhufeng from passing on bad news to his classmates. This not only makes song Daren and others feel puzzled, but also surprised GUI Li.</p>
<p>However, no one dares to talk about it to Su Ru. Facing her husband, who is in the Jingjing hall and uses the treasures of the immortal family to protect her body, Su Ru&rsquo;s face is so sad that Zongren can&rsquo;t speak. However, the small population of Dazhu peak has always kept a low profile in Qingyun gate. If there is nothing important, no one will come to this secluded mountain, As a result, dazhufeng held a public memorial ceremony in Shoujing hall for three days, but no one found it in Qingyun gate.</p>
<p>But in the early morning of this day, an outsider finally came and landed quietly on the Dazhu peak. It was Lu Xueqi who was dressed in white like snow and came out of the dust.</p>
<p>The light blue glow flashed by, and the auspicious spirit lingered gently. The sky was still shining in her white hands. Lu Xueqi looked around silently, and saw the green mountains and green waters, still overflowing as usual. It was not unusual that there were two white funeral curtains hanging on both sides of the front Shoujing Hall to see the sadness here.</p>
<p>She looked at the white curtain in silence for a while and went to Shoujing hall. Soon, she found that song Daren and others, dressed in mourning clothes, came out of the hall with a trace of surprise and embarrassment.</p>
<p>After seeing that it was Lu Xueqi and she was the only one, song Daren and others obviously took a breath.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi bowed his hands and said softly:! &quot; Lu Xueqi, under xiaozhufeng, have met elder martial brother song and all the senior brothers! &ldquo;.</p>
<p>Song Daren and Wu Dayi standing behind him, and he Dazhi and others did not dare to neglect him, and they all saluted one after another. Then song Daren gave a bitter smile and said:! &quot; Why did younger martial sister Lu come to our place? Oh, let&rsquo;s laugh at you! &ldquo;.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi didn&rsquo;t have a smile on her face. Instead, she was a bit serious and sad. She was silent for a moment and said:! &quot; Xueqi didn&rsquo;t mean to come here. She just wanted to pay homage to Uncle Tian and see Uncle Su Ru. I hope all the elder martial brothers will inform you. Xueqi is very grateful! &ldquo;.</p>
<p>Song Daren and others looked at each other and pondered for a moment. Song Daren said:! &quot; Sister Lu is polite. You are not a stranger, eh! &ldquo;.</p>
<p>He suddenly pauses, and Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s face seems to be inexplicably red. Song Daren is a little embarrassed. He smiles and takes it with him, saying:! &quot; Well, she&rsquo;s not here at the moment. She went to the back mountain bamboo forest alone in the early morning of this morning.</p>
<p>He spoke in a low voice, with a sad look on his face Shiniang, who was always grieving for master&rsquo;s fault, stabbed her to take her body and told me that she would bury her master alone! &ldquo;.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi frowned and felt a little uneasy in her heart. This situation seemed even more strange than she had expected before her arrival. Regardless of disturbing others, how could she not let her own daughter Tian ling&rsquo;er know that it was not easy for Su Ru to bury herself in the field alone?.</p>
<p>She turned her mind around and pondered for a moment. Finally she asked song Daren, &ldquo;what are you doing?&rdquo; Well, what about the man.</p>
<p>Song Daren was stunned at the beginning, but after looking at Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s face, he Dazhi, who had always been smart behind him, pulled his sleeve, which was a color to him. At the same time, he understood it. He hesitated for a moment and said:! &quot; Younger martial brother, he also went to the back mountain! &ldquo;.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi is slightly surprised and looks up at Song Daren. Song Daren smiles bitterly and says:! &quot; Shiniang didn&rsquo;t allow me to follow her. She only asked younger martial brother to go with her! &ldquo;.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi was silent. A moment later, she gave a gift to song Daren and others, saying:! &quot; Thank you very much, elder martial brothers. In this case, I will not delay you any more. I will come again to pay homage to Uncle Tian! &ldquo;.</p>
<p>Song Daren and others return a gift. Song Daren hesitates for a moment and says:! &quot; Sister Lu, there are many twists and turns here. I hope you will! &ldquo;.</p>
<p>Without waiting for song Daren to finish, Lu Xueqi already said:! &quot; I know, elder martial brother song, please don&rsquo;t worry. Xueqi will never reveal a word to others! &ldquo;.</p>
<p>Song Daren nods and doesn&rsquo;t speak any more. Lu Xueqi turns away.</p>
<p>After watching the white figure leave, Wu Dayi took a step and said:! &quot; Elder martial brother, I think she&rsquo;s probably going to the back mountain. Is that ok? &ldquo;.</p>
<p>He Dazhi, next to him, said faintly:! &quot; Where is Shi Duo? This younger sister Lu is definitely going to visit the back mountain. She came to dazhufeng today. She must have been under the command of martial uncle Shuiyue of xiaozhufeng. If she doesn&rsquo;t find out the situation of Shiniang, she can&rsquo;t tell Uncle Shuiyue when she goes back! &ldquo;.</p>
<p>Song Daren was silent for a moment and said:! &quot; It&rsquo;s ok if she goes. I always feel that the teacher&rsquo;s mother has been in a sad transition these days, and I&rsquo;ve been worried about whether anything else will happen. However, we can&rsquo;t disobey her meaning. Although the old seven followed her, we also know that the teacher&rsquo;s mother really asked him to leave, and she always respected her with her temperament, I&rsquo;m afraid I dare not disobey it. If Miss Lu of xiaozhufeng goes to have a look, there&rsquo;s no harm in it! &ldquo;.</p>
<p>When they heard this, most of them nodded and said yes. Then they were silent. Song Daren gave a joyful breath and went back to the Shoujing hall.</p>
<p>Looking at the bamboo forest behind Dazhu peak, the scenery here is quite similar to that of xiaozhufeng. As far as you can see, there are lush and green bamboo forests, dancing with the wind, and the morning light falls from the sky. In the gaps of the bamboo forest, light marks are projected and fall on the ground.</p>
<p>On the thin bamboo leaves, there are countless crystal dewdrops, smooth and round. Ru is the most precious pearl.</p>
<p>During the period of GUI Li&rsquo;s exposure, he felt a little lost for a moment. How many years ago, he started his life on the Dazhu peak. He waved a woodcutter, sprinkled his sweat, and cut down silently in the secluded bamboo forest. When he thought about it, he felt like a dream, but it was still quiet, but he could never find it back.</p>
<p>Bamboo waves, mountain breeze, in the ear.</p>
<p>He gave a joyful breath in his heart, threw aside the light senseless sentimentality, turned his head and looked at Su Ru.</p>
<p>Tian Buyi&rsquo;s body is lying on the surface not far away, and there is still rhubarb lying beside it, = since Tian Buyi&rsquo;s body returned to the mountain, it seems that this dog has been with Tian Buyi and never left.</p>
<p>Under Tian Buyi&rsquo;s body, there is nothing to pave the way. This seems to be disrespectful to the dead. However, from Gui Li to song Daren and even Du Bishu, no one dares to question Su Ru&rsquo;s behavior.</p>
<p>But even though she would not change her clothes, Su Ru&rsquo;s behavior was still very puzzling. She had the heart to ask, but now Su Ru&rsquo;s back was like a wall, which made him not know how to open his mouth.</p>
<p>It was at this time that Su Ru broke the silence:! &quot; Why, do you have something to say to me.</p>
<p>GUI Li was startled and then pondered for a moment. Finally, he said carefully:! &quot; Teacher Niang, I have a few words, I don&rsquo;t know when to say not to say! &ldquo;.</p>
<p>Su Ru said faintly:! &quot; You say it, I also know, these words, I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s not just against what one wants to say! &ldquo;.</p>
<p>After a moment&rsquo;s suffocation, he wanted to know that his teacher&rsquo;s wife was a very intelligent person. It seemed that the pain of her husband&rsquo;s death did not affect her mind. At the moment, GUI Li coughed slightly and said, &ldquo;what a wonderful thing Shiniang, please forgive me for being bold. I understand that Shiniang passed away to her master! &ldquo;.</p>
<p>Speaking of this, the ghostly and fierce eyes cast a glance at Tian Buyi&rsquo;s remains. He couldn&rsquo;t help but feel sad. After a moment, he continued to say:! &quot; However, the disciple begged the teacher&rsquo;s wife to be mournful anyway. In addition, although the teacher&rsquo;s mother was sad, Shifu&rsquo;s future affairs should be handled as soon as possible. What&rsquo;s more, elder martial sister ling&rsquo;er should be informed that she will come back to worship master! &ldquo;.</p>
<p>Su Ru did not look back, did not speak.</p>
<p>He looked down slightly and said in a low voice:! &quot; Teacher Niang, if you have said something bold, please don&rsquo;t care! &ldquo;.</p>
<p>Su Ru shook her head, slowly turned around, looked at GUI Li, and said:! &quot; You didn&rsquo;t say anything wrong, everything you said was right! &ldquo;.</p>
<p>GUI Li looked at Su Ru, but he was surprised. Su Ru&rsquo;s dress today is quite different from that of the previous days. Although she is still in mourning clothes, she can see that she has been dressed up and her spirit has improved a lot, which makes her more attractive.</p>
<p>After a while, he hesitated for a long time, and then he said:! &quot; Shiniang, I still have a moment. I dare to invite you! &ldquo;.</p>
<p>Su Ru said faintly:! &quot; Say it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a terrible way!&rdquo; The death of Shifu makes both the disciples and the teacher&rsquo;s wife feel sad. It&rsquo;s just that the master&rsquo;s body should not be moved lightly or moved to this back mountain! &ldquo;.</p>
<p>Su Ru suddenly cut off the road:! &quot; Are you teaching me a lesson.</p>
<p>He quickly shook his head and said:! &quot; I dare not.</p>
<p>Su Ru looked at him and didn&rsquo;t say anything, but her face slowly turned to ease. She seemed to think of something, and suddenly her face showed a sense of sadness Seven, do you know how many years your master and I have been married.</p>
<p>GUI Li&rsquo;s heart was shocked. He felt that there was deep sadness and sadness in his words. However, although he knew this, he didn&rsquo;t know how to comfort him. Now he was worried, but he had to say in a low voice:! &quot; I don&rsquo;t know! &ldquo;.</p>
<p>Su Ru smiles, turns around, slowly sits down beside Tian Buyi and whispers:! &quot; In fact, it&rsquo;s not only you don&rsquo;t know, even I forget myself. It&rsquo;s enough for me to spend the time in the mountains with him, but how can I think about it? He often laughs at me for being stupid and says that if we can&rsquo;t cultivate our Taoism in the future, we will not be able to enter the immortal record and fall into reincarnation again. At the moment of parting, we don&rsquo;t know what kind of scene it will be! &ldquo;.</p>
<p>Her voice sank and she said:! &quot; When I asked him what he wanted, he said there was no need for him. If he went ahead of me, the monks would not want to be buried in a big wind. Even the coffin could not be needed. It came naturally and went away naturally. He only wanted a soil of loess on the mountain behind the main peak. In this way, he could say that he could watch the people in front of the mountain at night and not be afraid of loneliness! &quot; Before she had finished speaking, her face was covered with tears.</p>
<p>GUI Li clenched his teeth and couldn&rsquo;t speak. The head of rhubarb, lying on one side, raised slightly and looked at Su Ru. Then he crawled down and wagged his tail.</p>
<p>Su Ru gazed at the field for a long time, and suddenly waved his hand and said:! &quot; Now go down the mountain and come back in half an hour.</p>
<p>GUI Li was startled and hesitated. He called out:! &quot; Teacher.</p>
<p>Su Ru said:! &quot; What&rsquo;s the matter.</p>
<p>After hesitating for a while, he finally boldly said:! &quot; Shiniang, Shifu and his old man agreed with you before he died. Naturally, the disciples dare not disobey it. It&rsquo;s just that they should inform elder martial sister ling&rsquo;er before the master enters the earth! &ldquo;.</p>
<p>Su Ru was silent for a moment and said in a low voice:! &quot; Or, you go down the mountain to tell Daren, let him quietly go to the dragon head peak to call ling&rsquo;er back.</p>
<p>GUI Li nodded and turned to leave. When he reached the stone steps at the intersection, he couldn&rsquo;t help but look back again. Su Ru was sitting beside Tian Buyi&rsquo;s body in silence. His figure was lonely, which made him feel sad. He looked back in a hurry and did not dare to look again and went on! &ldquo;.</p>
<p>Along the way, he was calm, but he didn&rsquo;t think of the same scene in the past few days. Su Ru didn&rsquo;t ask song Daren and others to inform Qingyun Mountain of the bad news. This is very strange in itself. Even Tian linger didn&rsquo;t let notice, which is even more unreasonable. Today, it&rsquo;s not easy to deal with Tian in this way. Although Tian had an agreement before his death, it was always careless.</p>
<p>GUI Li&rsquo;s heart softened and threw it away. In fact, people who practice Taoism don&rsquo;t value the future. It&rsquo;s not necessarily a good thing to bury the flesh and skin among the green soil and loess.</p>
<p>He thought so silently, but he didn&rsquo;t want to drive the wind. He walked down the mountain road all the way to the middle of the mountain. When he first went to Dazhu peak, he followed his elder martial brother song Daren and his younger martial sister Tian ling&rsquo;er to the back mountain. He didn&rsquo;t know how hard it was. The past is still in his mind.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t know that elder martial sister linger, how are you these years?.</p>
<p>A faint wry smile appeared in the corner of his mouth and shook his head. Then, he stopped and looked forward in surprise.</p>
<p>On the mountain road, a white figure in front of him suddenly offered money. He was graceful and beautiful. He stood in silence and looked at him in the morning light.</p>
<p>Ghost Li also looked at her, two people looked at each other for a long time, but seemed to have nothing to say.</p>
<p>The mountain wind blowing, blowing her hair and clothes, gently fluttering with the wind.</p>
<p>At last, I opened my mouth first:! &quot; How did you come here? &ldquo;.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi said in a low voice:! &quot; My master called me to come to see Uncle Su! &ldquo;.</p>
<p>GUI Li nodded silently, hesitated for a moment, and then went to:! &quot; Shiniang is treating her wound in the back mountain, but at the moment she wants to be alone, and she doesn&rsquo;t want anyone to disturb her. She asks me to go up in half an hour! &ldquo;.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi also nodded and said:! &quot; It doesn&rsquo;t matter. I&rsquo;ll just wait! &ldquo;.</p>
<p>Ghost Li should a, silence down, there seems to be Lu Xueqi also do not know what to say, between the two people, in this gradually become silent, although standing still, but seems to be farther away! &ldquo;.</p>
<p>After a long time, Lu Xueqi said softly:! &quot; Are your injuries better.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you can&rsquo;t do it Much better! &quot; Then he looked up at Lu Xueqi and said:! &quot; If you didn&rsquo;t save me, I&rsquo;m afraid I can&rsquo;t stand here. Thank you.</p>
<p>Look at Lu Xueli Call me, my sword! &ldquo;.</p>
<p>Suddenly he cut off the road:! &quot; Stop talking! &ldquo;.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi looks gloomy. She stops Kou and looks down in silence.</p>
<p>He seemed to be hesitant after listening to Gui Li, and then he continued:! &quot; She told me about all those things. She said that I had wronged you. I&rsquo;m sorry! &ldquo;.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s body shook and raised her head. There was a sense of sadness on her face. Her eyes were willing to look at her. But Rao was so. He said slowly, word by word:! &quot; Naturally, I believe what the teacher said, but master, after all, is the teacher who raised me and taught me. I know that maybe it&rsquo;s my selfish heart. I just hope you can give me more time and say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ok!&rdquo;.</p>
<p>！” I understand. I&rsquo;ll wait for you Lu Xueqi suddenly interrupted him.</p>
<p>GUI Li was a little surprised and looked up at her. The beautiful girl&rsquo;s teeth were biting her lips, and her eyes seemed to have tears in her eyes. But the body that seemed to hold you tight seemed to relax in an instant. There was a faint trace of comfort and smile around the corner of his mouth. Looking at the affectionate woman, the corners of his mouth moved and his heart suddenly filled with tenderness. He wanted to say something to her with a smile, However, at this time, suddenly from behind them on the top of the bamboo forest on the top of the mountain, there was a wild barking sound from afar.</p>
<p>His body suddenly stiffened.</p>
<p>It was the cry of rhubarb. After he returned to dazhufeng with the remains of his teacher Tian Buyi, rhubarb rescued one who followed his master&rsquo;s body in silence. There was no more loud noise. But at the moment, although the sound of rhubarb&rsquo;s barking was a little weak after a long distance, it sounded like crazy, and the cry was extremely desperate, which he had never heard in more than ten years.</p>
<p>What happened to rhubarb that suddenly became so hysterical and crazy?.</p>
<p>That heart has been deeply buried in the faint worry, suddenly all of a sudden burst into the heart, the fierce face suddenly became very pale, even his hands began to shake slightly. (to be continued. )</p>
