      <p>The ruins of Caomiao village at the foot of Qingyun Mountain.</p>
<p>As the sun rises and sets and the day and night change, Lu Xueqi doesn&rsquo;t remember how many days she has been here. She seems to have lost control of her love for more than ten years. She can&rsquo;t and doesn&rsquo;t want to endure any more. Every day and night, she will accompany the man and accompany him. If there is a future, then forever.</p>
<p>No, it should be Zhang Xiaofan. At least in Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s eyes, he has never changed. Now that haggard and sad man is held in her arms, still motionless and confused.</p>
<p>These days, Lu Xueqi has also thought of various ways to awaken Zhang Xiaofan from the heart demon dream, but all failed. In the end, Lu Xueqi also temporarily gave up her efforts. Perhaps, only she can really understand the harm in Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s heart!.</p>
<p>So she no longer tried to wake him up, but quietly accompanied him and hugged him two people. Just like this, she sat quietly in the grass covered ruins of Caomiao village, watching the sunrise in the morning, the setting sun, the moon rising, and the wind blowing through the wilderness with the fragrance of green grass everywhere, blowing gently on their faces.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why, even with a trace of guilt and guilt, but Lu Xueqi really felt a kind of happiness and love of people together from her deep heart. She endured this simple thing for ten years and took on the heavy pressure like a mountain. At such a moment, she finally got rid of the shackles and all the shackles, just for him.</p>
<p>The breeze brought a cool breeze.</p>
<p>Another night came.</p>
<p>Two people leaned against the broken wall and sat quietly. There were some foreign bodies in the weeds beside them, but Lu Xueqi didn&rsquo;t take a look.</p>
<p>Sure enough, a moment later, Xiao Hui&rsquo;s figure came out of the grass, jumped on the broken wall on which Lu Xueqi and Zhang Xiaofan were leaning, and sat down.</p>
<p>The cloth bands that Xiaobai used to wrap it were all gone. Most of the exposed wounds were healed. It seemed that Xiaohui had torn them off. Now, he was sitting on the broken wall, spreading his hands and a lot of wild fruits. They scattered freely and fell down a lot. Most of them hit Lu Xueqi and Zhang Xiaofan.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan is numb and unresponsive. Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s head is smashed with several pieces. Although it is not painful, it is not very elegant, which is incompatible with her cold temperament.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi looked at the wild fruit that had fallen to the ground. She looked up at the monkey on the broken wall. Xiaohui jumped up and stepped back. Her eyes were full of vigilance. However, she still held several wild fruits in her hand and chewed them in her mouth.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s because Xiaohui and Lu Xueqi get along with each other. Anyway, it seems that in Xiaohui&rsquo;s eyes, Zhang xiaois held by the woman in white, which seems to make him look bad. However, Lu Xueqi has been practicing Taoism all over the body. Although she has made provocative actions, she is still quite afraid.</p>
<p>When Xiao Hui&rsquo;s three eyes were staring at Lu Xueqi, the woman in white, who had never been close to the world like fireworks, suddenly gave it a smile. The smile was like the warm spring flowers and the warm spring breeze. There was no trace of her aloof attitude towards people in the past.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi didn&rsquo;t get angry. Instead, she looked in a good mood. She laughed at Xiao Hui and picked up a wild fruit from the ground. She said in a soft voice: &ldquo;did you pick it back? Thank you!].</p>
<p>Xiao Hui was obviously shocked by Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s strange reaction. After a long time, her three eyes wandered around for a long time. Her mouth grinned and she grinned. She sat back on the broken wall and ate wild fruit for herself.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi smiles at Xiao Hui and looks back. To her, how could she be born with that cold look?.</p>
<p>Her eyes fell on Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s face and whispered, &ldquo;Xiao Fan, have something to eat.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s eyes did not know where to look, just a blank and empty, did not speak, did not nod and shake his head. Lu Xueqi seemed to have known that he would be this reaction, and was not upset. She laughed at herself and held out her long white fingers, carefully peeling the skin of wild fruits.</p>
<p>These days, Zhang Xiaofan has always been like this. Xiaohui often goes back to find some wild fruits. Lu Xueqi peels the peel and puts it in his mouth. Then Zhang Xiaofan occasionally eats one or two pieces like a mechanical reaction.</p>
<p>However, what&rsquo;s the matter? Lu Xueqi thought lightly in her heart that she had been waiting for ten years. As long as she could be with him, for a long time, it would not care.</p>
<p>She lowered her head and carefully peeled it. The corner of her eyes swept to something. She was stunned for a moment. She slowly put down the wild fruit in her hand. Zhang Xiaofan sat and did not respond. However, his hands have been tightly clenched these days. Although Lu Xueqi found this, she didn&rsquo;t care. Just when she looked, she suddenly saw something in Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s palm, revealing a corner.</p>
<p>She gently frowned, put down the wild fruit in her hand, pulled up Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s arm, reached out to break his fingers and look down on the things in his palm. However, although Zhang Xiaofan was still in a daze, her hands were tightly held. Lu Xueqi couldn&rsquo;t break them off. She could only lift her finger slightly and barely looked in, But Zhang Xiaofan, even in this case, is still clinging to the hands of the original is a piece of water-green broken clothes.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi looked at the small piece of cloth in silence, and slowly put down Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s hand. There was a trace of gloom on her face, but then she took a deep breath. When she turned to look at Zhang Xiaofan, her eyes were full of tenderness.</p>
<p>Gently, stretched out her hand, Lu Xueqi hugged Zhang Xiaofan in her arms, the breeze blowing, her hair on the temples gently fluttered, a few silk fell on Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>[Xiao Fan, it will be OK, everything will be OK] she smiles. Although there are faint tears in her eyes, her voice is still gentle and deep.</p>
<p>[a long time ago, when I was a child, I remember my mother holding me and watching the stars at such a night] Lu Xueqi slowly looked up and looked at the night sky, where the sky was as black as ink, and the stars were twinkling in the night sky. [she told me that although everyone was going to die, a good person would become a star after death and live a good life in the sky every night, They will all look at us from the sky.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s a good person, isn&rsquo;t she? Maybe she&rsquo;s watching you in the sky? Xiao Fan, no matter what, she won&rsquo;t want you to be like this, don&rsquo;t you.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan lies in Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s arms, the stiff body seems to shake for a while.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi gently smile, two lines of tears quietly slide down, under the stars, her beautiful face in tears, as if there is a strange beauty, but her hands, but more tightly embrace the man in her arms.</p>
<p>Tight, hug him.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all it takes!.</p>
<p>[bullshit!].</p>
<p>Suddenly, a voice of scolding and drinking came from the side, with the boss&rsquo;s impatience and faint anger in the voice.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi was surprised and looked to the side. However, she saw a plump and beautiful woman standing beside her. Her face was charming and moving. It was Xiaobai.</p>
<p>After Lu Xueqi, Xiao Hui shouts with joy. She jumps down from the broken wall, rushes to Xiaobai and climbs up. She sits on her shoulder and grins. She obviously favors Xiaobai, which is quite different from Lu Xueqi.</p>
<p>However, at this moment, Lu Xueqi would not care about any monkey. She frowned and puzzled. She was shocked by the sudden appearance of Xiaobai and said: &ldquo;what?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Xiao Bai&rsquo;s face is very white. It seems that she is very angry. However, her expression is quite complicated. There is a hint of heartache under her anger. She only listens to her cold way: &ldquo;if a person dies, he will die. At most, he will become a ghost. When he enters the underworld, he will be reincarnated. How can he become a star!].</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really terrible to say this in person. Even though Lu Xueqi has been grateful for Xiaobai&rsquo;s telling her the reason and Zhang Xiaofan is in the ruins, she can&rsquo;t help but feel a heavy complexion.</p>
<p>But before Lu Xueqi could speak, Xiaobai had already come straight forward, but without looking at Lu Xueqi, she only stared at Zhang Xiaofan and said in a cold voice: &ldquo;how long do you want to go on like this? Do you want to live like this for a lifetime?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Xiao Bai asked in a fierce voice. Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s face moved, showing a bit of unbearable color. She opened her mouth to speak, but she forced herself to endure it. However, her hands seemed to be in general distressed, and she held Zhang Xiaofan closer.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was scolded by Xiaobai, the muscles on his face jumped for a while, but then he closed his eyes and returned to the autistic appearance. Seeing his appearance, Xiaobai seemed to be more angry. He grabbed Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s collar and lifted him up.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi says out of his voice, don&rsquo;t do this, he can&rsquo;t stand it].</p>
<p>Xiaobai sneered and said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to scold and wake him up, no, I don&rsquo;t want to wake him up, but I think I&rsquo;ll wake him up!&rdquo; without waiting for Lu Xueqi to react, Xiaobai suddenly raised his hand and slapped Zhang Xiaofan in the face of Lu Xueqi.</p>
<p>[PA! PA!].</p>
<p>The slap was clear and loud. Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s cheek swelled up under the two red palm prints, and the corners of his mouth also shed bright red blood. The whole person was beaten backward.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi is surprised, where there is so much Gu. She grabs it, pushes Xiaobai away and hugs Zhang Xiaofan. She doesn&rsquo;t care about blood stains and wipes it with her cuff.</p>
<p>Touching the palmprint on the two injured cheeks, Lu Xueqi was heartbroken. She opened her eyes and glared at Xiaobai and said angrily, &ldquo;are you crazy?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>But Xiaobai seems to turn a deaf ear to Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s words, just staring at Zhang Xiaofan, who is shaking slightly, and says coldly: &ldquo;what are you doing, pretending to be half dead all day, or are you somehow thinking of using this method to mourn Biyao? I tell you, don&rsquo;t be white crazy. It&rsquo;s useless to do this. Biyao is dead, she&rsquo;s dead!].</p>
<p>[roar.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a despairing roar burst out of Zeng Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s arms. Zhang Xiaofan suddenly pushed her away and rushed to Xiaobai like a wild animal. Unexpectedly, Xiaobai didn&rsquo;t dodge when he stood there. When he roared close, she took a step forward instead of retreating. It was a slap in the ear.</p>
<p>[PA!].</p>
<p>The louder voice suddenly reverberated among the ruins of Caomiao village. Zhang Xiaofan was beaten to one side, and a mouthful of blood gushed out of his mouth, which dyed the lapel of his chest red.</p>
<p>Xiaobai&rsquo;s face seemed to have a trace of pain, but she bit her teeth and looked more severe. She took a few steps and rushed to Zhang Xiaofan, who was unable to breathe on the ground. She grabbed him by the breast and clothes, and said angrily, &ldquo;wake up. Even if you do this until you die, Biyao will not survive. You think, Do you want to torture yourself in this way to make yourself feel better? I tell you, it&rsquo;s no use!].</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan closed his eyes, his body trembled violently, panting wildly, even his lips seemed to have lost their blood color.</p>
<p>Crystal tears, quietly fall, this time, but from the small white eyes, she clenched her lips, two lines of tears flow through her cheek, non-stop flow, and her voice, has choked.</p>
<p>[do you think that what was the purpose of Biyao&rsquo;s desperate attempt to save you? Was it to see you live your life like this? You have nothing to do with the death of Biyao. If you go on like this, Biyao&rsquo;s spirit in heaven will not rest. Do you understand it.</p>
<p>Xiaobai grabs him, slowly kneels down beside him, as if exhausted the last strength, hoarse voice, to him word by word way: [live, live well, this is what Biyao wants to see!] finish, as if she can&rsquo;t bear any more, she suddenly stood up and turned around, and left the place in a big step.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi has been standing beside her silently since just now. When Xiaobai strides by her side, Lu Xueqi suddenly whispers: &ldquo;thank you!&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Xiaobai&rsquo;s face is still covered with tears. She pauses for a moment. To Lu Xueqi, the two beautiful women are reflected in the moonlight. After a moment, they gently stretch out their palms and hold them together.</p>
<p>Xiaobai&rsquo;s face, behind the tears, showed a faint smile, nodded at Lu Xueqi, but did not speak any more and strode away.</p>
<p>After her figure disappeared in the dark, Lu Xueqi slowly walked to Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s side, squatted down, and slowly held him in her arms. Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s body was shaking, and slowly raised her head to look at Lu Xueqi.</p>
<p>His eyes, in an instant, seemed to go back to that time, the deep pain and the endless scars among them. He was like a child, his lips were shaking, and his eyes were full of tears.</p>
<p>[Biyao goes away. He trembles at Lu Xueqi, and tears come out. It looks like the injured child finally cries. He can&rsquo;t bear the grief of decades. He grabs Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s shoulder and holds her in his arms. He sobs loudly and chokes her in his mouth.</p>
<p>[Biyao&rsquo;s gone, Biyao&rsquo;s gone, Biyao&rsquo;s gone].</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi never thought that this strong man would be so fragile in front of her. However, at the moment, she only had tenderness in her heart. She hugged him tightly and tried hard to comfort the crying heart with every trace of warmth on her body. Behind the boiling tears, she kept gently saying, to the man and to herself: &ldquo;it will be OK, everything will be OK.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This night, as if extra long and sad.</p>
<p>After that night, Zhang Xiaofan wakes up from the heart evil dream satiety, but not more than nine, he started a high fever again.</p>
<p>According to his practice at the moment, it is impossible for him to have any disease in his daily life. However, this fever is burning all over his body. Lu Xueqi knows that his serious illness is actually caused by deep pain in his heart. The death of Biyao is the introduction. However, most of Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s mental disorders over the past ten years are the root cause of serious diseases, but no one can cure them.</p>
<p>Sure enough, Lu Xueqi tried all kinds of methods to give Zhang Xiaofan all kinds of elixir and elixir, but it was as bad as a cow into the sea, and it had no effect at all. However, the fever was so fierce that it didn&rsquo;t subside for ten days. If it had been a long time ago, she would have been dead. Now even Zhang Xiaofan is already haggard and can&rsquo;t be haggard any more. She looks quite skinny.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi was very anxious. She stayed by Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s side all day and night for ten days. She looked thinner. Maybe she saw her infatuation. God opened her eyes and left her feeling. On the eleventh day, when Lu Xueqi was about to despair, Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s fever finally subsided.</p>
<p>Although the fever subsided, Zhang Xiaofan was still in a coma. Nevertheless, Lu Xueqi was still greatly relieved. She relaxed a little from the tension. At the moment, a feeling of exhaustion flooded into her heart from every corner of her body. She forced Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s lapels to be sorted out, and then she leaned on her side and fell asleep.</p>
<p>On her beautiful face, there is a faint smile of peace of mind. Even after ten years of sleep, her hand also holds Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s arm. The breeze blows through the ruins of Caomiao village, and the grass flutters around their bodies. The world is silent. Only this forgotten corner seems to have a strange peace and happiness.</p>
<p>This sleep, but do not know how long sleep, the stars change, full of flowers, vaguely in sleep, she saw everything she had dreamed of.</p>
<p>Stay with the one you love for a lifetime.</p>
<p>Then she woke up.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi opened her eyes gently, and the body beside her was still there. He was sleeping peacefully, and his breath was right beside her.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi did not move, as if this is her favorite appearance, she quietly leaning on Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s side, listening to his sleeping breath.</p>
<p>Suddenly, at this moment, in the direction of Qingyun Mountain in the distance, suddenly there was a loud explosion in the sky, and then a huge fireworks burst out. Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s face changed slightly, frowned, and slowly sat up and looked around.</p>
<p>Fireworks change slowly in the sky to make a long sword. It is a signal rarely used in Qingyun gate. Only when there is a major accident in the gate and it is extremely critical, all the disciples nearby will be called to release it.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi was silent for a moment. Her eyes turned back to Xiao Fan for a moment. She stood up slowly. After hesitating for a moment, she finally reached out to take Tianya, who was leaning against the broken wall, and floated away.</p>
<p>The wind, or general blowing, grass, is also the same back and forth.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan quietly fell asleep in the grass. In the depth of the grass beside him, he suddenly poked out a head, but it was a grey haired monkey with three eyes. He turned around and gave a [squeak] cry. It seemed that he was surprised at the sudden absence of Lu Xueqi. Then he jumped onto Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s chest, touched his head and sat down.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan is still so quiet asleep, but his right hand, fingers gently tremble.</p>
<p>After about half a cup of tea, a light sound suddenly came from the entrance to the ruins of Caomiao village. Then, she saw Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s white figure reappear there and walked towards Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s sleeping place. The small ash sitting on Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s chest made a face at Lu Xueqi, jumped down and squatted on one side and looked around.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi slowly walked to Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s side, slowly knelt down beside him, but his face at the moment, the expression has completely lost the peace of mind and happiness just now, some are just heavy and that trace of pain.</p>
<p>[Xiao Fan&rsquo;s accident] her voice sounded so vague, as if she had no strength at all. She said faintly: &ldquo;I saw the urgent signal that our sect summoned its disciples just now. I went to have a look at it. It turns out that great things have happened outside during the time when we were here. The ghost king, the leader of the ghost King clan, did not know what evil magic weapons he had, and could even capture people&rsquo;s minds and use them, What&rsquo;s more, it is said that he hid himself in a huge red shadow and blood. Wherever the red shadow goes, both ordinary people and those who practice the truth will be transformed into a living dead man without any mind and driven by him].</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi looks pale and holds Tianya in her hand. However, when she looks at Zhang Xiaofan, she still shows tenderness and regret in her eyes. Before that, all the schools of justice have launched a number of encirclement and suppression against him, but all of them have been destroyed. The most terrible thing is that most of the people have been taken away by him and become servants of the ghost king, On the other hand, killing decent sects is now in full swing. The ghost king has recently approached the foot of Qingyun Mountain and carried out evil methods. He even bewilders the people in the villages and towns within a hundred li of Qingyun Mountain, including Heyang city. In addition, those people before him are afraid that the total number of people is no less than 100000, and they are about to attack Qingyun Mountain.</p>
<p>She was staring at Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s face. Suddenly, two lines of tears fell from her eyes, and the tears fell on the back of Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s palm.</p>
<p>[I wanted to be with you for the rest of my life. Even if I was scolded by the school, I didn&rsquo;t care. But now, but now] her lips trembled and her head slowly lowered. But now it&rsquo;s Qingyun. I was raised by Qingyun gate since I was a child. My master loved me and taught me. My kindness is like a mountain. If it&rsquo;s just for us to be together, even if we are scolded and despised by them, I would like to, but now they are in trouble, I can only go back and be with them.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi looked at Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s face deeply. She didn&rsquo;t move her eyes for a moment. It seemed that she didn&rsquo;t want to give up. The breeze brought her and her skirt fluttered gently.</p>
<p>[maybe you don&rsquo;t know that the Qingyun gate is in secret. The once invincible [killing immortal sword array] has been unable to start. I&rsquo;m afraid the battle is really bad. I don&rsquo;t know if I can come back to see you again].</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi took a deep breath and wiped away the tears on her face. Then, a slightly bitter smile appeared at the corner of her mouth and looked at Zhang Xiaofan in a low voice: &ldquo;Xiaofan, I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s the will of God, we always have no fate to be together forever, but] she pauses for a moment. After a moment, with a deep but firm voice, she said quietly:&rdquo; but, I never regret it!].</p>
<p>The whole body of her lips is warm as if she had been kissing.</p>
<p>Light, happy feeling.</p>
<p>She laughed, bit her lip, stood up, finally took a look at the sleeping man, turned around and walked away, but he walked so slowly that his body often seemed to turn back and have another look, but after all, she did not look back.</p>
<p>Perhaps, even she knew that if she looked back, she would never have the courage to leave!.</p>
<p>She finally left in white.</p>
<p>Wind blowing grass moving, wearing light and astringent fragrance, Xiaohui quietly came over, climbed up Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s chest and sat, silently looking at the white back that had gone away under its body, Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s palm, and his fingers moved a little.</p>
<p>The breeze is blowing all the time, and Caomiao village is once again immersed in the long silence. The day passes and the night comes, and the stars drop and see all the vicissitudes of the world.</p>
<p>Xiao Hui sits on Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s chest, and looks sleepy. He yawns and squeaks a few times. Then, it seems that he suddenly feels something. His eyes turn and looks at Zhang Xiaofan.</p>
<p>A low breath came, and then Zhang Xiaofan slowly opened his eyes.</p>
<p>The first thing that came into view was an endless sky, with countless stars shining in the deep darkness. He did not move, so he lay quietly and looked at the sky.</p>
<p>Xiao Hui seemed to have some doubts beside him. He touched his head and crawled over to have a look. But then he shrank back to the night wind. The grass was floating. That deep darkness has been like this for thousands of years. Compared with it, people&rsquo;s life is just a fleeting flick of a finger.</p>
<p>Perhaps, it is precisely because the ancients understood these that they would persevere in the pursuit of long!.</p>
<p>However, if it is just an empty shell, even if it is born, what?.</p>
<p>His expression is very calm, never had calm, no more sad, no excitement, he just looked up at the sky in silence.</p>
<p>The sky is infinite, the stars change, the sky and the earth are silent, only the wind blows.</p>
<p>Before I knew it, it was light.</p>
<p>But when the morning light fell and the last darkness disappeared, Zhang Xiaofan closed his eyes, and he lay quietly for a long time. Until the sun rose and the warm sun shone on him, he opened his eyes again. This time, he stood up.</p>
<p>Standing in the same place, he looked around. The ruins submerged in weeds were desolate but friendly. Many places were engraved in his heart from many years ago and would never be erased again. How many places were the places where they once ran and played and left simple happiness.</p>
<p>He walked away, stepping on the grass and grass, quietly, the small ash came to him, grabbed his skirt, climbed up to his shoulder and sat down.</p>
<p>[boo].</p>
<p>The wind from behind the clumps seemed to be bigger and made a whistling sound. The grass beside him rose and fell like a broken wall like waves. He gazed at him like a sunken but gentle man. He went to the north of the village, where there was still a ruins, even more dilapidated. From a distance, the outline was still vaguely like the appearance of a dilapidated temple.</p>
<p>This time, Zhang Xiaofan stood for a long time. He looked at the ruins of the small temple deeply. After a long time, a faint and friendly smile appeared on his lips.</p>
<p>That smile, is gentle, no more a trace of resentment and regret.</p>
<p>Then he turned and walked away, never looking back.</p>
<p>Come on, ash.</p>
<p>[squeak?] the monkey whispered on his shoulder and touched his head.</p>
<p>[where is it?] with a faint smile, facing the breeze, he said with a smile: &ldquo;go where we should go.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>His eyes moved, looking into the distance, the towering Qingyun Mountain, straight into the sky.</p>
<p>On the Tongtian peak of Qingyun Mountain, there is a bustling scene everywhere, but near the back mountain, it seems more secluded, and there is no personal shadow. I think it is because of the strong enemy&rsquo;s pressure on the territory, and a group of daoxuan real people who are the center of gravity are missing for no reason, so no one will notice this!.</p>
<p>When the afternoon came and the sun was shining on the secluded woods in the back mountain, Zhang Xiaofan had already walked on the quiet forest road among the mountains. He was not the first time to come to the mountain behind the Tianfeng mountain. He had been to the mountain several times before and after. He was familiar with the nearby terrain. He just looked at his expression, but he didn&rsquo;t care about it. He still had a quiet smile since he woke up, Walking slowly.</p>
<p>The mountain road is rugged, with ancient trees on both sides. From time to time, there are several birds singing from the depths of the forest. Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s eyes turn from the forest to the ground and look forward to the front. I don&rsquo;t know how many past events have happened on it.</p>
<p>The mountain forest is quiet and the wind is blowing. It seems that it doesn&rsquo;t touch the common customs.</p>
<p>The familiar trigeminal intersection in my memory slowly appeared in front of my eyes. Zhang Xiaofan stopped at the intersection and looked to the right side unexpectedly. After the layers of dense forest, the gap between the thick branches and leaves, a corner of the hall of the grand ancestral hall loomed out. With a smile, he turned and set foot on the path.</p>
<p>The intersection is not far away from the ancestral hall, and soon the solemn hall gradually appeared. However, Zhang Xiaofan did not go to the open space. He just stood quietly behind a big tree with luxuriant branches and leaves beside the mountain road and looked out in that direction.</p>
<p>The hall is still so dark, the stone steps and open space in front of the door are still like countless past days. After a while, a white figure comes out of the hall. He is handsome and extraordinary, with a gentle smile on his face. There is no sharp sword in his hand, but a broom made of bamboo.</p>
<p>He looked at the fallen leaves, but his face showed a slight smile. He raised his hands and took a deep breath of the sweet air among the mountains. Then he began to quietly clean the fallen leaves on the ground.</p>
<p>Broom flying, leaves were swept to one side, some of them like disobedient children were blown by the wind, stubborn want to return to the original place, he also smile to sweep back again.</p>
<p>The wind is blowing through the mountains and forests.</p>
<p>In the distance, behind the big tree, Zhang Xiaofan quietly looked at the familiar white back, revealing a knowing and quiet smile.</p>
<p>On the open space, Lin Jingyu seemed to feel something. After a pause in his hand, he turned to look at the mountain road leading to the outside world. It was just that the mountain road was empty. Besides the ancient trees and shrubs, where were the traces of other people?.</p>
<p>He was stunned for a moment, then slightly shook his head and began to smile. Maybe he heard it wrong. Thinking like this, he picked up the broom and swept it again.</p>
<p>After he came to the temple, he walked slowly away from the temple, and once again, he walked away from the temple.</p>
<p>He felt clearly that in the depths of the magic moon cave, there seemed to be a mysterious force calling on him to go to that place.</p>
<p>When he was still in the ruins of Caomiao village, this feeling was extremely strong!.</p>
<p>Standing in front of the magic moon cave, Zhang Xiaofan stopped and looked at the mysterious place in front of him.</p>
<p>The appearance of this cave is no different from other ordinary caves in the world. The rough stone is slightly different from the hard ground. Only the ground in front of the cave gate has been trampled smooth over the years, showing the wind and frost here.</p>
<p>From that small stone gate, we once walked out of the Qingyun gate, a generation of Tianjiao Qingye Taoist, and there were countless people who had stormed the wind and cloud in the past years and left their footprints here. This magic moon cave is actually a witness of the rise and fall of Qingyun gate in the past two thousand years.</p>
<p>Now, in front of Zhang Xiaofan, it is just an ordinary cave.</p>
<p>He laughed and walked in, as if he had come home, without hesitation or hesitation.</p>
<p>The sun as like as two peas outside the cave, and the stone walls were not covered by the stone walls. The cave looked very shady and cool. The scene of the primitive simplicity was as if he had been here for the first time.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan walked over and put his hand on the Taiji diagram. It was the real Xuangong method of Qingyun gate. In the clear light, the Taiji diagram slowly reacted and lit up. After a moment, as he expected, the mountain wall nearby slowly moved away, revealing the white fog door that was spinning like a strange water wave.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan gazed at the seemingly unfathomable whirling water wave. The last time he entered it, he was intrigued by the mysterious power contained in it, and he was almost trapped in the land of eternal destruction. Now, facing it again, the deep water wave seems to have a hidden absorbing power, which makes people have the illusion of falling into it.</p>
<p>He took a deep breath, stopped hesitating, and stepped in.</p>
<p>A sense of coolness rushed towards him, as if he had indeed stepped into a deep-water world. Only a moment later, Zhang Xiaofan found himself again like the previous one, surrounded by a world of emptiness and nothingness.</p>
<p>A dark, boundless, no light, no end.</p>
<p>Lying on the shoulder of the small ash four some uneasy up, moved a bit, low in the mouth called twice, Zhang Xiaofan gently stretched out his hand and patted the monkey&rsquo;s head, as if to comfort it, Xiaohui then quieted down.</p>
<p>Then, Zhang Xiaofan looked forward, but in his eyes there was nothing but darkness. He looked at it for a long time without any action. Finally, a faint smile appeared on his mouth, but he closed his eyes and walked forward.</p>
<p>Just a few steps out, suddenly that piece of death like silence has been broken. With a sound of [Bang], a blazing air rushed towards her face. Zhang Xiaofan could even clearly feel that she was walking into a sea of fire. Her skin and flesh were burning by the sudden fire. The pain came from every corner of her body, and the whole body seemed to be destroyed in this fierce sea of fire.</p>
<p>But he had already closed his eyes, and even when his face muscles were slightly distorted by fear of pain, his mouth still kept a faint smile. Step by step, though slowly, he continued to move forward.</p>
<p>On the shoulder, monkey Xiaohui made some frightened calls, and heard the spoon was very frightened. But Zhang Xiaofan immediately held it in his arms, so that Xiao Hui&rsquo;s head was buried deep in his chest and no longer looked out. Soon, it seemed that the owner&rsquo;s palm and his chest had a heartbeat, which made Xiaohui quiet down and he lay on his stomach motionless.</p>
<p>The sound of the fire burning is getting louder and louder. Even the air around the body seems to be filled with a terrible burning smell. The pain of the body is increasing. Every step seems to be suffering tens of thousands of times.</p>
<p>However, Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s pace did not stop, slowly and firmly forward.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know when, the feeling of the sea of raging fire slowly faded, and around him, there was a vast void of silence, and the pain of the body disappeared.</p>
<p>In a quiet, suddenly, a clear drop of water sound, ring in his ear, the cold water from nowhere, fell from the void, fell on his face.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s freezing.</p>
<p>For a moment, there was no sign at all. The roar came from the front, and it seemed to be omnipresent. Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s mind vividly depicted the terrible scene. The huge waves were like dragons, and the towering mountains were as small as ants. Even the towering Qingyun Mountain was destroyed and engulfed by him in an instant, The cold wind tore his body apart in an instant, and his pain was ten times more severe than that of the flame just now.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan never knew that a person&rsquo;s body would be so tortured and would feel such severe pain. Even his persevering nerve seemed to collapse before the pain. Tens of thousands of hands were pulling him in the silk, and even he could not continue to breathe. It was like being trapped in the deep sea, the infinite pressure immediately crushed him into powder and turned into the silent water.</p>
<p>Even if you die, you should open your eyes and look around before you die.</p>
<p>Like a lamp, the idea suddenly appeared in his deep heart, far away constantly flashing, like a temptation.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan inhaled deeply, slowly continued to walk forward, closed his eyes!.</p>
<p>The cold waves on all sides seemed to be infuriated. Suddenly, they became more and more furious. The roar was deafening. The feeling of torture like a thousand knives and thousands of cuts followed. Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s forehead was even covered with cold sweat, and his face was extremely pale. However, he always maintained the pure brightness that existed before the collapse, and still walked slowly.</p>
<p>Step by step, never stop, like life, slowly moving forward, after all, can not turn back.</p>
<p>The tide receded slowly, and the deafening terrible sound disappeared, and the silence returned to his side. There was nothing but the sound of his feet.</p>
<p>Alone, alone!.</p>
<p>[Xiao Fan].</p>
<p>Suddenly, a voice called in his back leisurely. In an instant, Zhang Xiaofan was shocked by thunder, and his face showed an unbelievable look. It was the first time that he stopped involuntarily.</p>
<p>His eyes were still closed, but his lips began to tremble slightly, a bit choked, a bit heartbroken, and a little desperate, low way: [Biyao].</p>
<p>The familiar voice seems to be behind him, with infinite tenderness, with a little bit of his soul haunting, unforgettable tenderness, secluded way: &ldquo;Xiao Fan, do you ignore me, you look back at me!].</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s body began to shake slowly. His body seemed to be in a fierce battle. He tried to turn around several times, but he endured it again. Although there was no pain, at this moment, he was sweating heavily and his face was twisted. It was more painful than the terrible fire burning in the deep sea and cold.</p>
<p>A deep but clear call, gently floating behind him, as if endless, this life is rough and drifting, is not for that voice? Why? Why not turn back?.</p>
<p>[ah].</p>
<p>Suddenly he roared, his body trembled, his teeth clenched, and his bones rattled, as if at last he had reached the limit of tolerance.</p>
<p>However, it seems that this is not over. In addition to the voice of Biyao calling for him behind him, slowly, he even heard the voice of other people, those who are unforgettable in his life.</p>
<p>Father, mother.</p>
<p>Master Puzhi!.</p>
<p>The field is not easy, Su Ru!.</p>
<p>There was no end to it. The voices were stacked one after another, calling and shouting behind him. The past of his life flashed past his eyes one by one.</p>
<p>Thousands of mountains and rivers, a person trekking; dusk snow mountains, only shadow alone.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t want to be lonely and live forever. What he wants is to be with his beloved.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan hugged his head and cried bitterly, like a child, he had no place to hide.</p>
<p>Tears dripping, in his palm, there is a touch of warmth, around the endless call, still in the ear, lingering, tempting him, let him open his eyes and go back.</p>
<p>But, that light warmth, but suddenly make his trembling body quiet down, this familiar and warm feeling, as if not long ago, he had also felt that there was a person, when he was on the verge of collapse, accompanied him by his side, hugged him tightly in countless dark nights, and warmed him with the warmth of his body.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, in the darkness of emptiness and emptiness, he was half asleep and half awake. In a trance, there were warm tears dripping on his face. In a terrible cold world, he was told that he was not alone.</p>
<p>This life, that thousands of mountains and rivers, that evening snow thousands of mountains.</p>
<p>no</p>
<p>single!.</p>
<p>The numerous voices around him suddenly became anxious, as if he had been stimulated by something, and continued to call Zhang Xiaofan with a bit of bitterness, but his body slowly stood up, and the pain and distortion on his face was replaced by a gentle and slow one.</p>
<p>Then, he gently smile, with a deep nostalgia, with unforgettable missing, light smile.</p>
<p>Then he turned and walked away, leaving all the voices behind him, letting it shrill and shrill, and then gradually subsided in the shrill sound.</p>
<p>Silence, at last, came again.</p>
<p>A slight cough came from Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s body. It was an old voice, with some fragility and surprise, [it was you].</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan stood in place, deeply breathing, slowly spit out a long breath, slowly opened his eyes. (to be continued. )</p>
