<p>After a while, on Xiangyun mountain, Bai Xiaochun limped, his head was erect, his face was a little dark, and he crawled back to the yard with fear. At the thought of countless lightning chasing him, he felt a shiver in his heart and immediately swore that he would never fly in thunderstorm days.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not flying, it&rsquo;s playing with your life!</p>
<p>In the wooden house, Bai Xiaochun grinned, and it took a long time to settle down. He sat cross legged on the bed, looking at the wind and rain outside the window. His inner cultivation was swimming slowly and moving all over his body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The second level elixir is suitable for condensing gas below level 8. If you want to continue to improve your accomplishments, you have to refine the third level elixir.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun is leaning on his chin to meditate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The third-order elixir must be very difficult. You must familiarize a large number of second-order elixirs before they are safe. Otherwise, the foundation will be unstable and the success will not be sure.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun opened the storage bag, took a look at his savings and sighed. He had received a lot of gifts as a glorious disciple.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that the consumption of refining medicine in these days is just as terrible. Although his alchemy habit is very economical, his savings are still reduced a lot at the moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go on like this. I&rsquo;ll run out of them.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun bowed his head and thought hard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a very good medicine man now. I can sell my own medicine.&rdquo; When Bai Xiaochun thought of this place, he was immediately excited. When the next morning, the rain stopped outside, he immediately left his residence and went to shanxiafang city to inquire about the price of the pills. After knowing the price of the pills, he bought a lot of herbs and even went to the ancestral home to exchange some of them.</p>
<p>Then he returned to the refining medicine Pavilion and began to refine medicine.</p>
<p>He did not refine second-order pills, although the price is higher, but the consumption is not small, and Bai Xiaochun knows his own habits, once refining medicine, time is too long.</p>
<p>So he chose the first-class pill he was most familiar with. A few days later, he refined three kinds of elixir with eight or nine grains, and two spirit incense. Then he went down the mountain to Fangshi.</p>
<p>In addition to the elders of the clan and some powerful disciples, most of the shops were set up by the Xiuzhen family of donglinzhou.</p>
<p>Like a small town, the inner and outer disciples of the three mountains on the South Bank of Lingxi clan usually come in and out here. Bai Xiaochun has been here for many times. Now she is familiar with the way and walks in the Fang City. She enters a medicine shop. She coughs, and immediately the staff in the drugstore rush forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Call your shopkeeper. This time I will not only buy Herbs, but also sell some pills.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun sat on the chair and said with a smile.</p>
<p>Not long ago, a middle-aged man in a purple robe walked quickly and saw a smile on Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bai Daoyou, I have heard of many brilliant things of Bai Daoyou for a long time. I didn&rsquo;t take the initiative to pay a visit because I was worried about disturbing you. Don&rsquo;t blame me.&rdquo; The middle-aged man, smiling, sat beside Bai Xiaochun, clasped his fists and said that he did not dare to offend Bai Xiaochun. He knew that the other party was in the clan, especially the status of the glorious disciple. His family still wanted to please Bai Xiaochun even if he had a centennial contract from the leader.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun ha ha ha smile, and the middle-aged man a kind of polite, this just took out three medicine bottles and the two spirit incense, put on the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sun Daoyou, give me a price.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun raised his chin.</p>
<p>Sun Chen picked up these pills with a smile. After looking at them one by one, he looked surprised. Although these first-class pills were inferior, with impurities accounting for 81.2%, they were infinitely close to the middle-class pills. They were not like the pills they had bought before, but they were as inferior as the ones they bought before, but the impurities were 84% of the samples.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brother Bai&rsquo;s medicine is exquisite. I&rsquo;ll take these miraculous medicines from my grandson&rsquo;s family. How about a price of 120 spirit stones?&rdquo; Sun Chen looked up at Bai Xiaochun, and his eyes gradually became bright.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun was surprised. The price was almost a miraculous pill, equivalent to four spirit stones. It was the highest in the first-class pills.</p>
<p>In fact, the average cost of a pill is just a half stone.</p>
<p>With a happy mood, Bai Xiaochun and Sun Chen hand over. Sun Chen is willing to show his affection. They have a good talk. When the final agreement is reached that another pill will be sent, Bai Xiaochun does not ask for the spirit stone, but exchanges the same herbal medicine for him. Then he leaves contentedly.</p>
<p>As time went by, a few months passed quickly. Bai Xiaochun, in addition to refining the first-class elixir to sell, bought a large number of herbal medicines, but also constantly familiar with the refining of various second-order elixirs.</p>
<p>Gradually, he became more proficient in refining second-order elixirs.</p>
<p>At the same time, the cooperation with sun&rsquo;s medicine shop became more and more stable. Almost all of his pills were bought by sun&rsquo;s medicine shop. On this day, Bai Xiaochun took out several bottles of miraculous medicine in the sun&rsquo;s medicine shop to exchange for plants and trees. When talking with Sun Chen, sun Chen said with emotion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brother Bai, why don&rsquo;t you refine some second-order elixir with your proficiency in refining medicine. Three months later, there will be a hundred auctions here once a few years. If brother Bai can refine the second-order elixir at that time, sun can arrange the auction, and the price will be much higher.&rdquo; Sun Chen looked at Bai Xiaochun. After several months of contact, he found that Bai Xiaochun was very cheerful and smooth. He was very happy to make friends with each other, so he suggested.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun has also heard about the auction of 100 families in donglinzhou. There are three auctions held together by 100 Xiuzhen families in donglinzhou. The first auction is held in the north bank square city, the second is in the south bank square city, and the last one is held in Donglin City, the largest Buddhist city in donglinzhou.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun lived in Lingxi for several years. Before that, he had held an auction. But at that time, he had just become a layman. He was busy eating Lingwei chicken and was not interested in the auction.</p>
<p>At the moment, Bai Xiaochun was a little moved. After inquiring about the time of the auction in the south bank, Bai Xiaochun and Sun Chen left and went back to the medicine refining Pavilion, where they sat on their knees thinking and making a decision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What Sun Chen said is reasonable. Instead of selling a little bit like this, it&rsquo;s better to take advantage of this opportunity to sell a good price at once, so that we can get more precious plants.&rdquo; When Bai Xiaochun thought of this, he came up with a second-order elixir and finally chose He is most familiar with Ziqi shenglingdan.</p>
<p>With this determination, Bai Xiaochun closed down in the medicine refining pavilion to refine the Ziqi Shengling elixir. Two months later, as Bai Xiaochun spent 7788 yuan on refining the elixir, he had refined three bottles of Ziqi shenglingdan, each containing 10 pills.</p>
<p>Especially one of them, the color is not the same as the lavender of other pills, it is dark purple, the medicine fragrance is not strong, such as introverted but not scattered.</p>
<p>When refining this pill, the furnace in front of Bai Xiaochun obviously vibrated different from usual times, and even the ground fire expanded at once.</p>
<p>At the moment, he took the deep purple elixir and looked at it in front of him. His eyes showed pride and excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zhongpin!! I finally refined a Chinese elixir</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are not many Chinese elixirs at the auction, but it&rsquo;s still a little bit worse to achieve a sensational effect After all, the auction is held once a few years, and there are many rare treasures. &quot; Bai Xiaochun pondered for a moment, gritted his teeth, took out the turtle shaped pot and began to refine spirit.</p>
<p>Three times later, the silver light was shining, and the elixir was no longer a medium-sized product, but a breakthrough product, becoming Excellent product!</p>
<p>This kind of high-quality product is amazing, and the impurity is only more than 10%.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun looks satisfied and looks at the high-quality purple Qi rising elixir in his hand. The color of this pill is almost black. Although the three holy lines on it are dim, they are as obvious as before. People can see at a glance that this pill is extraordinary.</p>
<p>Looking at the pill in her hand, Bai Xiaochun suddenly felt that she had found another way to spread the world&rsquo;s fame. She laughed and took out a knife and drew a picture on the pill Nice little turtle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master tortoise is out of the river again!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun gets up excited and looks forward to it.</p>
<p>With the elixir, Bai Xiaochun went down the mountain. When he came back an hour later, he was fresh and satisfied. Sun Chen&rsquo;s surprise when he saw that he had taken out three bottles of Ziqi Shengling elixir just now appeared in his mind. When he took out the high-quality elixir that had been refined for three times, the other party&rsquo;s jaw seemed to be falling off and he was stunned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just wait for the auction in a month.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun looks at a jade card in her hand, which is the qualification card for participating in the auction. If you take this, you can go to the auction.</p>
<p>During this period, the topic of the people in the clan gradually mentioned the auction. Soon, the disciples of the three mountains on the south bank made preparations for the auction, and the market at the foot of the mountain became more lively than before</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard from the brothers in the family on the north bank that in their first auction there was a fire of doom! It&rsquo;s a legendary thing. Even if it&rsquo;s just a flame, it can be called a treasure. It was bought by a disciple on the north bank with a lot of money. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are a lot of rare treasures in this auction of the hundreds of Xiuzhen families, especially the pills. I think it is because the battle of Tianjiao in the outer gate of the two sides of the Strait is about to start!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It should be for this reason that the Tianjiao battle between the northern and southern sides of the Taiwan Strait is the grand event of our Lingxi sect. It&rsquo;s hateful that for many years, the south bank has always been inferior to the north bank in terms of the top ten choices! I don&rsquo;t know if the top ten on the South Bank of this time can be shamed before snow! &quot;</p>
<p>In the following month, there were more and more discussions about the auction in zongmen, and Bai Xiaochun also heard a lot about it, especially the Tianjiao battle between the northern and southern sides of the Strait, but he did not pay attention to it.</p>
<p>Soon after the first mock exam, Bai Xiaochun was meditating on the same morning, and his eyes opened, and his right hand mould bag appeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The auction is about to begin.&rdquo; Looking forward to it, he quickly walked out of the yard and ran down the mountain. Along the way, he saw many disciples of other schools. There were many rainbow in the sky.</p>
<p>As soon as Bai Xiaochun patted his forehead, he remembered that he could fly, so he quickly pinched the formula. Suddenly, the golden black sword appeared. Stepping on the golden black, he turned into a golden light and rose to the sky and went away in a hurry.</p>
<p>Soon to the square city, he raised his chest, raised his small head, walked into the auction Pavilion.</p>
<p>The auction Pavilion is very large. There are thousands of seats in the hall, and even a large area in the rear. Although there are no seats, it is also a sea of people. As for Bai Xiaochun, almost as soon as he came in, he was picked up by Sun Chen, who was waiting there. He walked from another road to the second floor. After entering a separate room, Sun Chen retired.</p>
<p>This room is not big, opposite hollow, there is a balcony, the bottom is the hall, you can see the auction table clearly.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun met such a lively scene for the first time. At the moment, unlike other foundation building monks, she did not come out of the room. Instead, she showed half of her body in the balcony, for fear that no one would recognize her and kept coughing.</p>
<p>Gradually, below the crowd, there are some people to see white Xiaochun, a strange look, have to take back their eyes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that there are too many people here. Even if Bai Xiaochun coughs again, he can&rsquo;t spread it too far. He sees Hou Xiaomei, Zhou Xinqi and others from a distance, but he doesn&rsquo;t pay attention to him here.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun yelled for a long time. Finally, she was depressed and lost interest. After all, she stretched out half of her body and was very tired In particular, he was worried that if he accidentally fell down I&rsquo;m afraid that within the next day, countless people on the south bank will know.</p>
<p>In a short time, more and more people came here. Half an hour later, a clear Ding sound reverberated, and the surroundings gradually became quiet. Countless eyes focused on the auction table in this moment.</p>
<p>A middle-aged man in a blue shirt came out with a smile and stood there with a fist around him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Under Qian song, there must be many Taoist friends who know Qian. This time, Qian presided over the auction. The rules are still the same, and the one with higher price will get it.&rdquo; His words are simple. With a wave of his right hand, a light door suddenly appears on the auction table.</p>
<p>A young woman came out with a tray in her hand, on which was an irregular stone composed of countless pieces of iron.</p>
<p>In the light of a flash, reflecting a colorful awn, look around thousands of people, one after another eyes a bright, some show surprise.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun also looked carefully, didn&rsquo;t recognize what it was, but looked at the expression of those people who were surprised, it seemed that it was a very wonderful thing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first auction item, gold refined iron, is a low price of 300 spirit stone, and the price is not less than 50 Ling each time.&rdquo; Qian song opened his mouth slightly, and his voice spread all over the country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three hundred and fifty spirit stones!&rdquo; Soon, someone started talking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four hundred!&rdquo; Almost at the same time that the first price appeared, someone immediately bid, and soon the price was called to 700 spirit stone, which was bought by an inner disciple of ziding mountain.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s eyes widened. He looked at the iron, wondering why it was worth seven hundred spirit stones. At the same time, after the auction began, it seemed that there were arrays here, which could make the price maker&rsquo;s voice expand a lot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A piece of broken iron.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun is a little sour, sitting on one side and watching.</p>
<p>Soon, a piece of auction items 6 were bought, especially a green corner, which seemed to have been thunderstruck. It seemed that faint arc-shaped electric light could be seen on it. This item actually sold for the price of 8000 spirit stones. Bai Xiaochun was shocked.</p>
<p>Until the auction for more than half an hour later, Qian song&rsquo;s voice echoed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At present, the auction is a bottle of second-order elixir, Ziqi Shengling elixir, a total of 10 pills, the quality is infinitely close to the middle grade, the impurities are controlled within 81%, the low price is 100 spirit stones, and the price is not less than 10 Spirits each time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hearing this, Bai Xiaochun was in high spirits at once, and looked at it eagerly. He was worried about his gains and losses. He wished that everyone could make an offer.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t know why, there is some cold around. Bai Xiaochun gives a thump in his heart and waits for a while before someone makes an offer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One hundred and ten spirit stones.&rdquo; The one who offered the price was an outsider, who had almost all his savings. Now he finished and looked around nervously.</p>
<p>But Bai Xiaochun was more nervous. The cost of this bottle of Ziqi Shengling elixir was 50 spirit stones. If you put it in the market, you could sell 156.</p>
<p>At the moment, he was sad and silly.</p>
<p>Fortunately, when Qian song wanted to fix the board, someone finally offered a price. In the end, he pushed the price to 180 cents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One hundred and eighty spirit stones are also good, 20 more than in Fangshi.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun was relieved, wiped off the sweat on her forehead and comforted herself. In fact, the price has been quite a lot, but compared with those precious things in front of her, it is inevitable that there will be some gap.</p>
<p>Soon, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s second bottle of miraculous medicine was also sold, and the price was slightly higher. There were 200 spirit stones, which surprised Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>Until his third bottle of miraculous medicine was also auctioned, the atmosphere of Congqi disciples gradually increased, and the number of people who asked for the price continued to increase. Finally, Bai Xiaochun was ecstatic. His second bottle of miraculous medicine actually sold 230 spirit stones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are more than 700 spirit stones, which are worthy of being auctioned. That&rsquo;s enough. These spirit stones are enough for me to refine the third level miraculous medicine.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun is a person who is easy to be satisfied with. Although he is still depressed before this moment, he has not put it in his heart. He is very happy in the room and looks forward to the appearance of his excellent drug.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this case, my excellent elixir should be sold Three hundred spirit stones? &quot; Bai Xiaochun hesitated for a moment, a little uncertain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two hundred will do!&rdquo; He nodded.</p>
<p>As time goes by, under the waiting of Bai Xiaochun, at noon, Qian song on the auction table appears some strange looks. Looking at the people around him, he coughs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The auction items that Qian will take out next are very interesting It&rsquo;s a second-order elixir. It&rsquo;s the same as Ziqi shenglingdan, but Some of them are different. &quot;</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun immediately nervous, stand on the balcony, worried about gain and loss of the heart incomparably strong.</p>
