      <p>Go to &ldquo;small talk → net&rdquo; to provide you with wonderful novels to read. A kind of Go to &ldquo;small talk → net&rdquo; to provide you with wonderful novels to read.</p>
<p>With this persistence, Bai Xiaochun lies in the yard. Although his body is sour and soft, he can vaguely see that his skin seems to be obviously harder. This scene makes him more eager to become a pharmacist.</p>
<p>After lying in the yard for more than half an hour, Bai Xiaochun immediately got up and sat down on her knees. When her eyes flashed, she took out the bottle of pills and incense that she had obtained after becoming a disciple of the outer sect.</p>
<p>After a careful look, he took a deep breath and looked around. Then he turned back to the cabin and took out the turtle pot directly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These pills can be used now. After soul refining, I should be able to break through from the third layer of condensate gas to the fourth layer of condensate gas. Unfortunately, the materials of the two color fire are too expensive. Although there are some in the fire kitchen room, I am not a servant of the fire kitchen room now, which is not convenient.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun is now very interested in pills. After a moment&rsquo;s thinking, he takes out the wood with the same color of fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just make it one time!&rdquo; He immediately lit the wood, and immediately the fire burned. A line on the turtle shaped pot was soon bright. Bai Xiaochun opened the bottle directly. There were three pills the size of longan in it, which were divided into three times for soul refining.</p>
<p>After a while, three silver grains of pills appeared in Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s hands. After he had refined the green incense, he looked at the four kinds of elixirs that had been refined once again. Bai Xiaochun sat down on his knees, put the fragrance before and after the noodles, picked up the three pills and threw them all in his mouth.</p>
<p>Then he showed the fourth picture of Ziqi controlling Ding Gong. He practiced according to the pithy formula. Soon, he had the aura rolling in his body. This time, he insisted more time, and his internal cultivation became active and began to increase.</p>
<p>After a stick of incense, the spirit River in his body was running all over his body. He began to impact the fourth layer of condensate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fourth layer of condensate can be reached by sticking to 100 interest rates again!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun gritted his teeth and endured the movement of the fourth picture. His body almost all turned into a ball. The sound of clicking came from his whole body, and beads of sweat kept falling down.</p>
<p>But at this time, the aura in his body suddenly dried up. Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s eyes coagulated, and suddenly opened his mouth to the green fragrance in front of him and vomited out a breath of aura.</p>
<p>As soon as the aura touched the green fragrance, it immediately burned itself and sent out wisps of green smoke. These green smoke, like green snakes, went straight to Bai Xiaochun after it appeared, and penetrated through his seven orifices and sweat pores. It turned into a strong aura in his body, making the river of aura double.</p>
<p>With a bang, a wave of air spread from Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s body to the wooden house and spread out of the yard. As if there was a strong wind blowing here, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s eyes showed joy and began to laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four layers of condensate!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He immediately felt that the aura in his body was full of vitality at the moment. He was swimming down constantly. When he looked down, he saw countless black dirt sticking to his body, knowing that it was the impurities in his body that were forced out again.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun was fresh and fresh. He pinched the key with his right hand. Immediately a wooden sword flew out of his storage bag and went straight ahead. The speed turned into a rainbow.</p>
<p>After controlling the wooden sword and flying back and forth in the courtyard for several times, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s satisfaction became stronger. His wooden sword was not vulgar, and with his cultivation of four layers of condensation gas, he already had a certain sense of killing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good to refine spirit. If there&rsquo;s three color fire, it&rsquo;s as good as Dan medicine.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun thinks that the miraculous medicine is more and more magical. Whether it is Dan or Xiang, it is necessary to practice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must become a great pharmacist, refine the elixir of immortality, and then refine ten times No, a hundred times Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s idea of becoming a pharmacist is even stronger. Thinking of this, he patted the storage bag and took out a jade slip from it.</p>
<p>This jade slip was taken by Hou Yunfei when he took him to Wanyao Pavilion. There are ten thousand kinds of plants and plants in it, as well as pictures and pictures. This is a special book only Xiangyun mountain has. It is necessary to master as a spirit child.</p>
<p>However, only 10000 kinds of plants are not enough. Bai Xiaochun remembers Hou Yunfei once said that only by remembering these 10000 kinds of plants can they exchange for the next volume.</p>
<p>He got up his spirits, and various kinds of plants gradually appeared in his mind. The more he looked, the more new they were. It seemed that he had opened another fan in his life. There were even herbs he needed to exchange for longevity pills.</p>
<p>After a rough look at all of them, Bai Xiaochun felt that if he wanted to remember all the 10000 kinds of things, it would not be difficult. But who was he? His goal was to become a great pharmacist who could refine the elixir of immortality.</p>
<p>Therefore, the ferocity hidden in his character broke out again. Instead of simply remembering, he observed every herb very carefully. Only when he understood each herb to the utmost extent would he go to see the next one.</p>
<p>At that time, under the pressure of Xu Baocai, Bai Xiaochun could practice madly for half a year. At this moment, under the great ideal, he also burst out this potential.</p>
<p>He studied the pictures and pictures of the herbs to a degree of even subtlety. As long as you close your eyes, you can outline the herbs directly in the back of your head.</p>
<p>He even felt that it was not enough. He lamented that there was no real object. Otherwise, he would like to take it apart directly and observe it more thoroughly from the inside. Without any way, he could only look more and more carefully. No matter the lines or branches and leaves, he would never give up until he studied thoroughly.</p>
<p>Finally, she felt that it was not enough, so Bai Xiaochun did not let go of her roots and fruits, as if she had magnified those herbs by countless times in front of her eyes and went to dig a little bit.</p>
<p>He even felt uneasy. In the end, he made a deep exploration into the fluff on every plant and the small holes under the hair.</p>
<p>As time went by, a month passed quickly. During this month, Bai Xiaochun was practicing the fourth layer of Ziqi Yuding Gong every day. His accomplishments in his body were finally loosened. At the same time, he didn&rsquo;t stop working on immortal life. He endured severe pain every day, running back and forth in the yard, holding plants, trees and jade slips and remembering all kinds of herbs in silence. At the moment, he has already achieved what he had in his mind The degree to which herbs began to compare was not recorded in the jade slips. He had to explore and study them by himself.</p>
<p>In addition, every time he ran in the yard, he would pause in the upper right corner of the yard. There was a spiritual field in which he planted ten herbal seeds.</p>
<p>This herb is called lingdongzhu. He went out half a month ago and went to the task of the disciples of Xiangyun mountain. He finally found a sect mission without any danger.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun didn&rsquo;t dare to take Li Qinghou&rsquo;s words seriously. Bai Xiaochun firmly remembered the requirement that the disciples of the clan should complete at least one task every six months.</p>
<p>In the task he chose, the contribution points are not small, and even according to the quality of the final delivery, the contribution points will be improved. After all, although it is simple, it will take a lot of time. It will take at least three months to plant in hand to be qualified.</p>
<p>But Bai Xiaochun didn&rsquo;t have time to take care of it. So she took it back and threw it in the holy field.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so slow.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun looks at Lingtian and frowns. He has seen the introduction of Lingdong bamboo from the grass, trees and jade slips. He knows that this herb has high requirements for aura. If there is no land with rich aura, the best way to cultivate it is to take the spiritual Qi of the monk as the nutrient.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It should be the spiritual field in my yard. The aura has been so thin that it makes the seeds of these asparagus grow slowly.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun squats down and grabs a handful of soil from the Holy Land and murmurs after a long time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can I do to make the aura of this spiritual field stronger&hellip;&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun thought about it for a moment, and suddenly her face moved. When her right hand raised a finger, the turtle shaped pot appeared quietly.</p>
<p>Looking at the pot, and looking at the Lingtian, white small pure eyes in the light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This pot can refine everything, so Can spiritual land also be used to refine spirits When Bai Xiaochun thought of this place, he was immediately curious. After taking out the seeds of the bamboo, he immediately dug down a lot of holy soil and threw them into the turtle pot. Then he took out the wood with the same color of fire and began to try.</p>
<p>Soon, the silver light flashed, and the spirit soil in the turtle shaped pot appeared the same silver grain of soul refining once, but it was more gloomy, but the soil in the pot was obviously rich in aura.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun was immediately happy, and did not mind the trouble. He poured out a pot and threw it in again. After half an hour, when he used almost the same color of firewood, the holy land had been all refined by him once.</p>
<p>The only thing is that the soil for soul refining is a layer on the surface. If there is not enough wood in the deep place, he did not go to the soul refining. As time goes by, the spiritual soil here has no roots and is difficult to maintain for a long time. As time goes by, it will gradually return to the ordinary.</p>
<p>In spite of this, the aura of the spiritual field has changed dramatically from before. The aura is so thick that it even smells fragrant.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun quickly planted the seeds of Lingdong bamboo. Standing on one side, he could not blink his eyes. Soon, he saw a green bud breaking through the visible speed of the naked eye and growing crazily.</p>
<p>The speed of growth is more than three feet in a blink of an eye. If a disciple who specializes in planting herbs in the sect sees it, he will surely take a breath. Even if a monk nourishes himself with his aura, it is difficult for him to grow so fast.</p>
<p>After all Looking at the whole Xiuzhen world, no one has ever been extravagant enough to use the spirit refining on the land just to plant ten winter bamboo trees</p>
<p>Even the famous alchemists would never do this. It&rsquo;s really a waste.</p>
<p>Seeing that these Lingdong bamboos are growing well, Bai Xiaochun is satisfied. She turns around and ignores them. She continues to run in the yard and continues to study the plants and plants in the jade slips in detail.</p>
<p>As the sun sets, as the sky darkens, the winter bamboo trees in the holy field in Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s yard have soared to nearly three feet high What&rsquo;s more, it seems that it&rsquo;s far from the limit. I don&rsquo;t know how amazing the growth will be in three months</p>
<p>It was also on this night that Bai Xiaochun put down the plants and trees in the jade slips. With his ruthlessness, he had completely remembered all the plants in the jade slips. Moreover, each of them was meticulous to an amazing degree. He even saw that there were contradictions in the introduction of individual herbs in the jade slips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the morning of tomorrow, I will go to change the second chapter of vegetation. I don&rsquo;t know what method Wanyao Pavilion uses to assess whether a person is qualified to learn the second one. Is it recitation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun raised his chin and swung his sleeve. He was just about to make a bold speech, but he felt uneasy. He coughed and picked up the jade slips to review again. He was worried that there would be something wrong with the assessment of the second chapter of the grass and trees in exchange for tomorrow.</p>
