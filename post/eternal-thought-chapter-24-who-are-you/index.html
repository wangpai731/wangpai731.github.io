<p>In the courtyard of Xiangyun mountain, Bai Xiaochun looks at the jade pendant in her hand, and her spirit moves. Immediately, the jade pendant emits a soft blue light, covering her whole body.</p>
<p>He pinched the key with his left hand, and immediately the wooden sword flew out. After turning around, he went straight to Bai Xiaochun. When he touched the blue light, he seemed to be sinking into the water, which slowed down a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good baby!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun took the wooden sword and took the jade pendant. She was embarrassed and murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s OK. Li Qinghou is Zhou Xinqi&rsquo;s master, but he is also my guide. According to the relationship, I have to call him uncle. I&rsquo;m my own man. Zhou Xinqi is half of my own.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun coughed, put the jade pendant away, and stood there stretching.</p>
<p>After eating more than half of Li Qinghou&rsquo;s Lingwei chicken, his immortal life skill has made rapid progress, and now it has reached 70%. After all, the spirit tail chicken replenishes its own vitality, not aura. Therefore, his cultivation is still four layers of condensation gas, but he has made a lot of progress, such as being compressed.</p>
<p>As for the chicken bones, they were all buried in the spirit soil. The spirit of this holy land is now extremely exaggerated. The Lingdong bamboo planted in it is more than two feet long. The whole body is no longer green, but has a dark color.</p>
<p>There are also the spirit tails of the most important three color fire. Bai Xiaochun focuses on collecting hundreds of them. When he thinks that the burning of these spirit tails can release the three color fire, Bai Xiaochun is full of expectation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not in a hurry. As long as there are enough pills, I can improve quickly after refining three times with three colors of fire. I&rsquo;d better make sure that this is not a small success first!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun thinks about it, and suddenly gets hungry. He looks at the direction of Xiangyun mountain chicken raising. He quickly takes back his eyes and looks at ziding mountain from afar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elder martial brother is in ziding mountain. How are you doing now?&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun thought of the scene of the fire stove, and she thought more about it. She got up and walked out of the yard, went down the mountain and went straight to ziding mountain.</p>
<p>Lingxi lives in the three mountains on the south bank. Qingfeng mountain is mainly used to control swords, and Xiangyun mountain is good at miraculous medicine. The ziding mountain is famous for its skills and soul refining. Especially the basic skill of the south bank, Ziqi controlling Ding skill, originally comes from ziding mountain.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun followed the path of zongmen and arrived at the foot of ziding mountain at dusk. He looked up at the cloud shrouded ziding mountain, and looked at several figures like small black spots in it. He was filled with emotion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know when I can control things and fly. Only when I do this can I see a wider world and truly step into the road of eternal life.&rdquo; White small pure eyes show expectations, on the purple tripod mountain.</p>
<p>Although he was not a disciple of ziding mountain, he was qualified to go to any mountain peak and walk up the mountain road. On the way, he inquired about Zhang Dahai&rsquo;s residence when he met people. He was very pleased with his clever appearance. Soon he asked where Zhang Dahai was and walked quickly according to the other party&rsquo;s instructions.</p>
<p>Different from the place where he lived in Xiangyun mountain, the house where Zhang daphou lives is located on the sunny side of the mountain peak. There is a lot of aura there, and there are not many houses. The attics are decorated with stars, which seems to contain some rules.</p>
<p>With the dusk, the light is not clear, but you can still see the surrounding clouds are thin, more spiritual plants, a piece of immortal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The elder martial brother has a good future. It&rsquo;s much better than me to live here.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun takes a deep breath of aura and is quite envious.</p>
<p>After searching for a while, he finally found Zhang daphou&rsquo;s house. Seeing that there were many weeds in the yard, it seemed that no one had taken care of it for a long time. Bai Xiaochun was stunned and knocked on the door, but he didn&rsquo;t respond for a long time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it a mistake?&rdquo; When Bai Xiaochun was surprised, the attic door in the yard creaked open. A thin figure was holding a flying sword in his hand, and the silver light in his left hand was slowly dim. He walked out tired and his voice came out lazily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; Just as he was saying this, the skinny man suddenly felt a shock. He saw Bai Xiaochun across the courtyard, and his face immediately showed surprise. If he saw his relatives, he quickly stepped forward, opened the door, looked at Bai Xiaochun, and laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ninth younger martial brother!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun opened her eyes wide and suddenly stepped back. She looked at the familiar but strange guy in front of her. [love to go to the small</p>
<p>This man is ordinary in appearance, thin and skinny, not to mention his skin and bones. Although his eyes are full of brilliance, his eyes are sunken, and his cultivation fluctuates, which is already full of condensation gas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nine fat, I am big fat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seeing Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s appearance, the thin young man wanted to cry without tears. He said, and his face showed strong grief and indignation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jiupang, you don&rsquo;t know how hard I have been in this year and how harsh my master is to me. When she first went up the mountain, she said that she didn&rsquo;t like fat people. She had starved me for half a year!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Half a year, jiupang, do you know what I&rsquo;ve become in those six months? What you see now is that I&rsquo;ve been making up for a long time.&rdquo; This thin young man, it was Zhang daphou, who shed tears when he said this.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun looked at them carefully and heard the other party&rsquo;s voice. Then he determined that the person in front of him was his elder martial brother. Bai Xiaochun took a breath and looked at two people who were completely different from his own memory. He was stunned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you have a grudge against your master?&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun looks at Zhang daphou sympathetically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That old lady, I&hellip;.&rdquo; Zhang daphou gritted his teeth, but after saying a few words, he trembled for a moment, and did not dare to continue. He took Bai Xiaochun into the yard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ninth younger martial brother, I miss huozaofang. It&rsquo;s really not a place for people to stay. Since I came here, I&rsquo;ve never had a full meal. I&rsquo;m hungry.&rdquo; Zhang daphou is sad and indignant. He pulls Bai Xiaochun and tells him all his sufferings from going up the mountain to now.</p>
<p>Listening to each other&rsquo;s sufferings, Bai Xiaochun suddenly felt that, compared with her, her act of stealing chicken at that time was really too correct. She looked at Zhang Da Pang&rsquo;s thin body. Bai Xiaochun sighed and patted Zhang Da Pang&rsquo;s bare shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elder martial brother is in trouble. Naturally, younger martial brother wants to help. You can wait for me for a long time.&rdquo; After that, in Zhang daphou&rsquo;s stupefied stupor, Bai Xiaochun turns around and walks out of the yard. When he went up the mountain, he noticed that the places where several places for raising Lingwei chickens were located on ziding mountain. Now, taking advantage of the night, his figure quickly disappeared.</p>
<p>Zhang daphou couldn&rsquo;t figure out the situation. He didn&rsquo;t know what Bai Xiaochun was going to do. He had to wait at the door, but before a single stick of incense arrived, Bai Xiaochun came back quietly with two Lingwei chickens in his hands.</p>
<p>Seeing the Lingwei chicken, Zhang daphou suddenly opened his eyes. Before he could speak, he was pulled into the yard by Bai Xiaochun, ignoring Zhang. Bai Xiaochun skillfully took out the pot, boiled the water, plucked the chicken and threw it in. Then he patted his sleeve, raised his chin and looked at Zhang daphou.</p>
<p>Zhang daphou breathes quickly and is stunned. He points to the chicken in the pot, and then points to Bai Xiaochun. His face is unbelievable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You You Are you the chicken stealing maniac of Xiangyun mountain</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun laughs. She lifts her right hand to the pot more skillfully, and the aura spreads out, which makes the chicken in the pot quickly cooked and rotten. Soon after the aroma wafts out, Bai Xiaochun grabs a chicken leg directly and puts it in front of Zhang Da Pang.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eat!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun spoke with pride, revealing that he had just arrived at the fire kitchen, and Zhang daphou was holding Ganoderma lucidum to let himself eat.</p>
<p>After swallowing several times, Zhang Da Pang stares at the chicken leg in front of him, grabs it and gobbles it down. Then, without Bai Xiaochun continuing to say anything, he leaps straight to the cauldron and almost sticks his face into it. Soon, he eats all the chicken bones, crunching and swallowing them. Finally, he drinks all the soup.</p>
<p>Then he patted his stomach and lay beside him. When he was intoxicated, he looked at Bai Xiaochun. The two brothers looked at each other for a moment. They both laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jiupang, you are good at it. You have many ideas when you are in the fire kitchen. Unexpectedly, the famous chicken stealing maniac of Xiangyun mountain is actually my brother.&rdquo; Zhang Da Pang&rsquo;s face is full of glory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cultivation is a matter against the heaven. Naturally, monks of our generation have to contend with heaven, seize with others, and be self reliant. Little Lingwei chicken is nothing.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun waved his hand and couldn&rsquo;t hide his pride. His identity had been held in his stomach for too long. At the moment, someone shared it. Looking at Zhang daphou&rsquo;s expression, Bai Xiaochun felt very comfortable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a pity that all the Lingwei chickens in Xiangyun mountain have been eaten by me, and only the chicks are left. Otherwise, if you live in my place, I will feed you every day, and I will make you fat again.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun sighed.</p>
<p>Hearing this, Zhang daphou&rsquo;s eyes suddenly lit up and quickly got up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ziding mountain has ah, west head, south head, as well as the north side of the disciples, shift guard every day, two shifts, a team of seven people!&rdquo; Zhang daphou opens his mouth quickly and says it in great detail. After that, he finds that Bai Xiaochun looks at himself in surprise. Zhang daphou coughs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After hearing about the chicken stealing maniac, I also intend to learn, but those chickens are too thieves. I scream as soon as I get close to them. As a result, not only did I fail, but I almost got caught.&rdquo; Zhang said with some embarrassment.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun immediately became happy and approached Zhang daphou. They murmured in a low voice. Slowly, Zhang Da Pang&rsquo;s eyes became brighter and brighter, and they were short of breath. They saw Bai Xiaochun take out the bamboo cicada. After a while, they were all in a flutter and laughed together.</p>
<p>At this moment, the night, their laughter from the yard, sounds particularly sinister</p>
<p>From this day on, Bai Xiaochun simply lived here with Zhang daphou. Gradually, the Lingwei chicken of ziding mountain began to lose</p>
<p>Whenever late at night, two thieves, one stealing and one guarding, slowly the disciples of ziding mountain were in uproar and had a discussion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you hear that the chicken stealing maniac of Xiangyun mountain is on our purple tripod mountain!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw with my own eyes that the chicken stealing maniac is not one person, it is two people!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the news reached Xiangyun mountain, all the disciples of Xiangyun mountain took a deep breath and looked at ziding mountain with sympathy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This chicken stealing maniac has finally learned to balance. He no longer only stares at our Xiangyun mountain to steal&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
