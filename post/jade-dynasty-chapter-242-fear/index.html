      <p>Xumi mountain, Tianyin temple.</p>
<p>There was silence in the remote wooden house. Both master Puhong and master Pude were silent. FA Xiang stood aside with a look of error and consternation on his face. However, he remained silent. The ghost was staring at the treasure in front of him. The soft white light made his face bright and dark.</p>
<p>The black cloth curtain is wrapped in it, which is a magic weapon of jade plate. The material is extremely warm and blue white, and there are serrated folds which are concave inward at intervals not far from the edge. Each fold will be divided into a fine groove, which will be scratched from deep to shallow to the center of the jade plate.</p>
<p>The white light in the center of the jade plate is the softest and brightest. It is almost like water flowing gently in the empty air. Under the brilliance, you can see that there are countless small pieces of jade, dense and dense, but they are obviously arranged in the center of the jade plate in an orderly manner. From the perspective of the Taoist practice at the moment, we can see that the small jade pieces are actually on each side There is an ancient and clumsy font carved, but he can&rsquo;t understand the meaning of these words.</p>
<p>On the edge of the jade plate, the four directions of southeast and northwest are engraved with mysterious and unsophisticated patterns. Some are like stars in the sky, some are like isolated islands in the deep sea, and some are even so strange that they can&rsquo;t see the meaning at all.</p>
<p>But at the moment, GUI Li didn&rsquo;t care much about the meaning of these small characters and patterns. What he was surprised at was that the countless small jade blocks were flowing continuously. None of them was still, and all of them were moving. They flowed slowly like flowing water, but they were not only flowing in one direction, but all directions were their directions, but under such dazzling movement However, there seems to be a subtle implication of the truth that all the jade blocks did not collide.</p>
<p>He looked at it for a long time, and suddenly felt that there was a mysterious force on the jade plate. In his eyes, the countless flowing jade pieces turned into rivers, mountains and rivers, and then turned into stars all over the sky. After a while, the stars disappeared in an instant. He was astonished to find himself in the darkness of nothingness. In the lonely darkness, scenes of paintings flowed by, and there was a previous life. Like the afterlife, but at the foot of his body, he did not know when a void, dark and unfathomable huge black hole appeared. The irresistible strong suction rushed up from the black hole and pulled his whole body down.</p>
<p>It seems to sink endlessly into the darkness</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on</p>
<p>All of a sudden, a sudden break, such as thunder in the ear sounded, the body shook, as if awakened from a dream, sweat dripping, the whole person as if experienced a war, tired, panting.</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong, who sent out a lion&rsquo;s mouth to wake up the ghost, showed compassion in his eyes, and gently combined his ten ways: &ldquo;benefactor, your life experience has been rough. There are too many worldly obstacles, and there are countless sad past events, and the heart demons are very heavy. This heaven and earth samsara plate is unique in the world. It has the ability to lead the soul and soul. It can cut off the life and death, calculate the samsara and set the Qi. It has the power to reverse the heaven and earth. It can also make people lose their mind and spirit, and the heart demons will devour the body. Please be careful.</p>
<p>After a long time, he slowly calmed down. In front of the heaven and earth reincarnation jade plate still issued a soft white light, quietly flowing in front of the people.</p>
<p>Although I was shocked by this strange power that I had never heard of, if I thought that the treasure was so wonderful, I would have more hope to cure Biyao. At the thought of this, GUI Li was not surprised but pleased. He bowed down to master Puhong and master Pude and said, &ldquo;I sincerely ask the two masters to build a seven level pagoda and help the foundation. He borrowed the treasure to his disciples for the time being. Afterwards, he would return to the mountain in person. In the future, he would offer it day and night to pray for the two masters to achieve good results. &quot; Then he kowtowed heavily.</p>
<p>Master Pude raised his hand slightly, but although his speech was becoming fluent, his body movements were still very numb. He only moved his arm, and then he heard it again.</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong, beside Xin Hao, had already passed by, lifted up his ghost and said in a soft voice, &ldquo;benefactor, don&rsquo;t have to do this. Get up and talk!&rdquo;</p>
<p>FA Xiang also came to the side, and the ghost calendar stood up slowly.</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong said with a smile: &ldquo;master Pude has already taken out this treasure, so he has agreed to lend it to you. You can rest assured.&rdquo; Ghost Li was so happy that he was about to thank him. However, master napod&rsquo;s voice rang out at this time and said, &ldquo;benefactor, I have a few words to say to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ghost calendar quickly Su Rong way: &ldquo;master, please say, I&rsquo;m all ears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Pude said slowly, &ldquo;this treasure is both good and evil. It can most bewitch people&rsquo;s minds. If people&rsquo;s heart is like a mirror, it will be helpful to do it in an orderly manner; on the contrary, it will be like a demon just now, and it will eat you back. You and I don&rsquo;t know each other very well, but you can also see that the almsgiver&rsquo;s way is very deep, and he has a lot of knowledge and all kinds of methods. In the future, the potential of cultivating truth is very great, and the achievement should be far better than ours.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that the benefactor is strong outside and weak inside. He is full of vigor and weak in feeling. His heart has become a big trouble, just like a sword hanging his head. Do you know? &quot;</p>
<p>The ghost calendar was silent for a long time, and said: &ldquo;dissatisfied with the two masters, the disciples didn&rsquo;t care about the mastery of nature, so they could have a long life. As for life and death, after so many changes, I feel that I can&rsquo;t love my life. The world and I are also illusory. Why should I care about the mere demons. Today, I&rsquo;m running around in the world. However, there are still a few people in my heart who can&rsquo;t be abandoned. I should live a life to report to my confidant. He slowly raised his head, a faint smile, said: &ldquo;as for other get, the master doesn&rsquo;t have to worry about me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Pude looked at the ghost for a long time and sighed. He closed his eyes and stopped speaking. The ghost calendar saluted master Pude, stepped forward and carefully wrapped the heaven and earth samsara plate with black cloth, and put the precious and heavy place in his arms. Master Pu Hong said, &ldquo;be careful, benefactor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He nodded, frowned suddenly, reached out and patted his forehead. He laughed and said, &ldquo;look at my memory. I&rsquo;m too happy to remember anything. How to use this treasure has not been consulted yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Pude slowly opened his eyes and looked at master Puhong. Master Puhong had a question in his eyes, but master Pude sighed and shook his head slowly.</p>
<p>Master Puhong&rsquo;s brow slightly frowned, no words, master Pude hesitated for a moment, looked at the ghost.</p>
<p>GUI Li bowed deeply and said, &ldquo;please give me some advice. I&rsquo;m very grateful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Pude shook his head in silence. He was stunned for a moment. He didn&rsquo;t know why. After a moment, he only heard master Pude&rsquo;s hoarse and low voice: &ldquo;I left this treasure around for decades. I&rsquo;ve been looking at it day and night. The soul is reincarnated, but I still can&rsquo;t understand how to urge the use of this strange treasure.</p>
<p>GUI Li Ru was poured a basin of cold water on his head. He was cool from head to foot and looked at master Pude in disbelief. Then he slowly looked at master Pu Hong.</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong sighed and said, &ldquo;benefactor, this is why younger martial brother Pude and I have been hesitating. The heaven and earth samsara plate has the power to turn the universe around and reverse the cause and effect. But Xiangbi is also because the magic power is too against the heaven, so ordinary people can&rsquo;t understand the mystery.</p>
<p>He was speechless and speechless. His heart was in a state of chaos, and thousands of words poured into his mind, leaving a bitter taste of speechless in the end.</p>
<p>After a long time, he suddenly laughed bitterly, shook his head and said, &ldquo;no matter what, please the two masters still lend this treasure to Yiyong, no matter what.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always a hope.</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong and master Pude said in the same voice: &ldquo;Amitabha.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next to him, FA Xiang took a step and said in a low voice, &ldquo;benefactor Zhang, I&rsquo;m really sorry&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li shook his head in silence and suddenly laughed at FA Xiang. However, in his eyes, the smile was extremely bitter and astringent. He only heard him say slowly: &ldquo;brother FA Xiang, you don&rsquo;t need to comfort me. In fact, this is such a thing. It&rsquo;s not the first time for me. Once upon a time, I had great hopes in front of me, but I just fell short of success&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>His voice dropped. A flash of pain flashed on his face, not to mention a word. He bowed his hands to Puhong and Pude, and then he turned around and never looked back. He strode out.</p>
<p>Looking at the back of the ghost calendar, master Pu Hong looked complicated in his eyes and said softly, &ldquo;Amitabha, the Buddha is merciful. He is troubled by karma. He is really miserable all his life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Pude was silent for a moment, and then he said a word softly. &ldquo;Amitabha</p>
<p>Huqishan, the general Hall of ghost king.</p>
<p>It has been three days since Xiaobai returned to Huqi mountain. During these three days, her eyebrows did not seem to relax. Within three days, the tragedy was staged several times in front of her. Watching those crazy dead ghost King sect disciples and their surroundings increasingly immersed in fear, and seeing that even if he was not crazy, there were other people driven mad by this terrible atmosphere, Xiaobai was already completely Certainly, something strange and terrible must have happened in this Huqi mountain. However, what made her puzzled and annoyed most was that under such circumstances, she could not see the king of ghosts</p>
<p>According to the disciples of the ghost King sect, the ghost king suddenly ordered to close down and not to meet foreigners any more. Even ordinary GUI Wang sect disciples could not see him. Xiaobai asked the disciples of guiwangzong to report to him several times, but the news that came back was almost the same. If the disciples of the Guiwang sect who had gone to report that they could not see the leader of the ghost king, or that the ghost king had sent a message to ask Xiaobai to wait for a few more days, he would be able to leave the pass immediately. In short, he would not come out to see her.</p>
<p>Although Xiaobai&rsquo;s Taoism is profound, he is in such a strange atmosphere as the ghost King clan. He is in a bad mood no matter what he does. He often sees people dying of madness around him from time to time every day. The horror of such crazy places is beyond the description of words.</p>
<p>In fact, Xiaobai, with her thousand years of practice, has vaguely felt that there is a strange and bloodthirsty power behind this seemingly vast and magnificent cave in the mountain. She is especially fond of it. Every time she sees the scene of someone dying of madness, the special smell of blood becomes more and more intense.</p>
<p>Three days ago, she had just arrived in Huqi mountain to meet the first ghost King&rsquo;s disciple, old Li Fa. When she died of madness, she unexpectedly found a mysterious figure hidden in a corner. The bloody smell on her body was the most vigorous. However, when she pursued the past, she found that the mysterious figure had disappeared and had not appeared since that day.</p>
<p>At this moment, Xiaobai already felt that his patience was going to wear out!</p>
<p>In the stone chamber, Xiaobai is sitting alone. Although the thick stone walls around are also covered with cracks that have not been seen before, they can still block most of the noise and surround the stone chamber with a precious silence. However, Xiaobai&rsquo;s face did not mean peace at all. On the contrary, the anger on her face became more and more intense. What happened in front of her in the past few days had completely broken her previous impression of the ghost king, and her disciples were deeply impressed</p>
<p>In the midst of terror, the suzerain disappeared completely. He didn&rsquo;t even come out to pacify the people, let alone take any measures to solve the situation.</p>
<p>This is an unheard of thing, Xiaobai even doubted whether the ghost King clan was made during her absence</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s so bad about the ghost. Otherwise, where would such a situation appear if the former king of ghosts had great talent? It&rsquo;s just that Xiaobai thinks about it, but he always thinks that the ghost king is such a powerful person. There is no reason to be rebellious by his subordinates. However, Xiaobai still thinks that the sister Xiaochi and the ghost King were married. He doesn&rsquo;t want to be too rigid, so he has to wait patiently. Who knows, we waited for three days and three nights.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pa!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaobai, with a gloomy face like water, patted the bed beside her body. Then she stood up and went straight to the door of the stone chamber.</p>
<p>After three days, she could not bear it. She is determined to go to see the ghost king and ask clearly. Otherwise, she might as well leave here. She doesn&rsquo;t want to stay in such strange places for a day.</p>
<p>Just as she was about to walk into the stone gate, Xiaobai suddenly showed her eyebrows and wrinkled. She seemed to feel something and stopped.</p>
<p>Sure enough, a moment later, there was a movement outside the stone gate, and then a respectful voice came in: &ldquo;is Xiaobai there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaobai stepped forward and opened the stone gate. Outside the stone room stood a disciple of the ghost King clan. Twenty up and down, it seems that he is still very young, but his eyes are dark, and there is a tired color that can not be covered. It can be imagined that this person is also troubled by those strange things around him.</p>
<p>Seeing Xiaobai there, the guiwangzong disciple&rsquo;s facial expression was even better. Xiaobai had an extraordinary friendship with the ghost king, the leader of the ghost King clan, and the vice leader of the ghost King clan. No one in the ghost King clan knew that she was respectful.</p>
<p>Xiaobai takes a look at him. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; he said</p>
<p>The young disciple of the ghost King sect said: &ldquo;the disciple was ordered by the patriarch to invite Miss Xiaobai to meet him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaobai was stunned, then sneered and said, &ldquo;does he have time at last. I&rsquo;m finally willing to see me. &quot;</p>
<p>In her voice, she was angry and disrespectful to the ghost king. The ghost King disciple heard this, and his face flashed a trace of fear and lowered his head a little bit.</p>
<p>Xiaobai snorted and didn&rsquo;t want to make it difficult for him again. He said faintly, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s just that I&rsquo;m going to see him too. In that case, you can lead the way</p>
<p>The ghost King sect disciple seemed to be relieved and nodded: &ldquo;yes, girl, please follow me.&rdquo; She did not dare to look at Xiaobai more, and turned to walk towards the deep of the corridor.</p>
<p>Xiaobai followed the disciple of the ghost King sect and walked forward. He saw that the direction of his journey was the residence of the ghost king. It seems that the ghost king is really what he is called Shut up He came out and went back to his own house. The corner of the small white mouth moves for a while, on the face flashed a sneer.</p>
<p>They went all the way. Ten Zhang away from the stone chamber of the ghost king, the disciple of the ghost King clan stopped and said in a low voice, &ldquo;little white girl, the master ordered to meet you alone, so I won&rsquo;t go in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaobai frowned. Although the ghost king had told him to do so, it was still ten feet away. This disciple stopped walking. In any case, it was extremely impolite. But when she turned her head and looked at the young disciple of the ghost King sect, she was stunned. She saw that the disciple&rsquo;s face was a little stiff. Her hands were beside her, but she seemed to rub her clothes on her leg side involuntarily, as if her palms were constantly pouring out sweat. She was extremely nervous and afraid.</p>
<p>Xiaobai was silent for a moment. His application eased down and sighed, &ldquo;OK, you go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young disciple looked up at Xiaobai and immediately lowered his head. However, it was obvious that his whole body was relaxed. It was as if the huge stone which had been pressed on his back was removed in an instant, and a smile appeared at the corner of his mouth. &ldquo;Thank you very much, miss,&rdquo; he whispered Then he turned and walked quickly.</p>
<p>Xiaobai&rsquo;s eyes turned around and looked at the stone chamber of the king of ghosts. After pondering for a moment, he calmed down and took a step forward. Suddenly, at this moment, from the distance behind her, there came a piercing roar. The voice was as sharp as a sharp blade, which suddenly pierced the fragile peace in the cave.</p>
<p>It was not the first time Xiaobai heard such a sound, but his chest still suddenly sank. He turned around with a cry, but he only met. The corridor was still empty and there was only one figure standing there like a stiff stone.</p>
<p>In the distance, the roar and the people&rsquo;s voices were gradually mixed together. Then there was a chaotic voice of drinking, scolding and fighting. The faint smell of blood, as if invisible water, flowed around Xiaobai&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p>But at the moment, Xiaobai didn&rsquo;t care about it any more. She frowned, but she was staring at the young disciple of the ghost King sect. The stone chamber where the ghost king lived was naturally in a quiet corner. The corridor was quite long. At the moment, there was no one except Xiaobai and the young disciple of the ghost king. There was still a numbing and frightening cry in the distance. I didn&rsquo;t know which poor man was crazy again.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the young disciple&rsquo;s frozen body began to shake, and the shaking became more and more severe. Then he gave out a cry of despair: &ldquo;ah!&hellip;&rdquo; I can&rsquo;t stand it&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>He pulled out the blade to protect his body, as if the empty place beside him was full of evil spirits who were trying to harm him. He slashed the blade in the air with a sharp whistling sound in the air. From time to time, he cut on the rigid stone wall, leaving a faint scar.</p>
<p>The distant roar faded, but the crowd seemed to hear something. It started to move here.</p>
<p>Xiaobai snorted coldly. Suddenly, the white shadow flashed. The young disciple seemed to have lost his sense. The next knife was cleaved to Xiaobai. Xiaobai grabbed the young disciple&rsquo;s wrist as fast as lightning. With a slight effort, he could only hear a crisp sound. The blade in the disciple&rsquo;s hand fell down and fell to the ground, while he had no idea People also lean against the stone wall like a weak body</p>
<p>Xiaobaiding looked at the man&rsquo;s eyes and saw that he was puffing and puffing. His eyes were scattered and some crazy, but there was no bloodthirsty red blood except for a few red threads on the bottom of his eyes.</p>
<p>Xiaobai breathed a sigh of relief. He heard the noise in the distance approaching here. He pondered for a moment. With a wave of his right hand, he brushed the young disciple&rsquo;s head. With the flash of his white sleeve, his body shook, his eyes closed slowly, and he fell to the ground powerlessly.</p>
<p>Xiaobai&rsquo;s face was tense, and he turned around and floated to the stone chamber where the ghost king lived. Behind him, many figures were looming, running towards here. (to be continued. )</p>
