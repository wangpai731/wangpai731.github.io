      <p>In the forest in the middle of the night, the light that has been emitted by countless magic weapons is like the day. From the depths of the forest to the most intense open space, it seems that there are sharp lights flying everywhere. Under the colorful and beautiful light, the bright red blood is constantly rising and sprayed on the slightly trembling trees.</p>
<p>It coagulates into blood beads and drips silently.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi, with a clear roar, landed on the ground. For a moment, in the night, she was blue as the sky and clear as the water. She shot out from the Heavenly Sword in her hand, like the gentle eyes of a beautiful woman, passing through the secular world.</p>
<p>Countless luxuriant branches and leaves, turning outward together, clattering.</p>
<p>The disciples of the demon sect in black all around were not only screaming, but also beaten out even though they were struggling to stop them. Since her escape from the abyss of death, she seems to have made a lot of progress in her Taoism.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan looked in his eyes from afar, but took a breath of cool air, surprised and admired. But then he turned his attention to his surroundings. Song Daren, Du Bishu and other people were already struggling. The number of disciples of the demon sect who besieged them was small, but the Taoism was higher than other people around. And look at their clothes. There&rsquo;s a skull mark on their clothes. I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s the mark of the ghost King clan.</p>
<p>Tian ling&rsquo;er was standing in front of Zhang Xiaofan, his face was slightly pale, and there were thin sweat on his forehead. However, he put his hands to his feet to control the amber and Zhuling, without any confusion.</p>
<p>Among all the disciples of dazhufeng, Tian ling&rsquo;er is the youngest except Zhang Xiaofan, but she is far more qualified than several elder martial brothers. Besides song Daren, she is counted in the discussion of Taoism. But the disciples of the surrounding evil cult did not know whether they saw her as a woman or for any other reason, but the main direction of attack was always towards her. At this moment, even Zhang Xiaofan felt that Tian linger was struggling.</p>
<p>Night wind, quietly blowing through the forest has become a battlefield, the dark depths, as if there are countless eyes watching.</p>
<p>The shouts around him were more and more urgent. Zhang Xiaofan frowned and looked out. Only in this short time, the situation has changed again, and the demon sect has already made a response. Lu Xueqi, FA Xiang, Qi Hao and others, who were still in a state of flux just now, and so on. At the moment, they are all right with the experts. They are stuck in the same place. Although they don&rsquo;t fall down for a while, they can&rsquo;t get rid of them.</p>
<p>However, there are more and more disciples of demon sect around the disciples who are not good at Taoism. The screams continued, and the situation began to fall back to the demon cult.</p>
<p>As soon as Zhang Xiaofan bit his teeth and drew out the fire staff, he refused to rest like this. At least he had to help senior brothers and elder martial sister ling&rsquo;er. Unexpectedly, his body shape moved. Suddenly, hearing Tian ling&rsquo;er&rsquo;s exclamation in front of him, his body shape was smothering. It seemed that he was tripped by something. In a moment, three or four magic weapons came to him.</p>
<p>Song Daren and others were shocked. Zhang Xiaofan rushed up without much thought, but it was a step too late.</p>
<p>At this critical moment, Tian ling&rsquo;er&rsquo;s face lost color, just like white paper, her hands waved, and amber Zhu Ling &ldquo;brush brush&rdquo; flew in front of her, but it was too late. In a twinkling of an eye, two magic weapons, white and black, rushed to her eyes.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s heart almost jumped out. He opened his mouth wide, but there was no sound. At this time, he saw a flash of white shadow. A figure stood in front of Tian ling&rsquo;er, waved his hands, and beat the two magic weapons back. In the dark far away, there were several angry drinks and shouts.</p>
<p>There was a sigh of relief. Looking at the man, I saw that it was Su Ru, the teacher&rsquo;s mother.</p>
<p>Su Ru hurriedly turned around and looked up and down at Tian ling&rsquo;er and said, &ldquo;ling&rsquo;er, is milk OK? &quot;</p>
<p>Tian ling&rsquo;er was shocked and nodded, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ok, ma&rsquo;am. &quot;</p>
<p>Su Ru frowned tightly. At this time, the disciples of the surrounding evil cult forced her to come back. Su Ru said in a hurry, &ldquo;hurry up, you can&rsquo;t stay here for a long time! After you rush out, you leave the island. We will meet in Hecheng, donghaichang. &quot;</p>
<p>Song Daren, Tian ling&rsquo;er and others were shocked, but Su Ru&rsquo;s face was grim. Tian ling&rsquo;er answered, and the people of Dazhu peak walked back.</p>
<p>At this moment, there was chaos in the field, and the war situation was extremely fierce. Su Ru flashed left and right, and saw that there was a critical young disciple of the right way, so she went forward to rescue him and ordered him to retreat. She has a high level of Taoism, which is far superior to the common disciples of the demon sect. Only in the night, her figure is floating and graceful, but she doesn&rsquo;t look urgent.</p>
<p>There was a gap. She looked up and saw that there were dark clouds in the sky, but there were bright lights. In the middle of the sky, Taoist Cangsong and Tian were not easy. They were fighting with the hundred poisons of the demon sect and the Duanmu ancestor.</p>
<p>She was quite worried, but it was not easy to see the field. Although she fought with the blood sucking old demon, she still didn&rsquo;t lose the wind to Duanmu at the moment, so she was relieved.</p>
<p>At this time, Su Ru was attacked several times to get rid of the encirclement. In the right way, ordinary disciples had gone a lot. Most of the disciples who stayed in the field were Lu Xueqi and other disciples who had a deeper Taoism, many of whom were fewer.</p>
<p>However, there are many people in the demon sect who seem to follow them, so although the right way is still in the downwind, there is no great danger for a while.</p>
<p>However, Su Ru&rsquo;s heart was more and more anxious, because right in front of her, from the beginning to the end, the most mysterious ghost king and the green dragon in the demon sect were standing there, smiling and watching the opera.</p>
<p>In the demon sect, the ghost king and the green dragon stood side by side, watching the disciples of the right way running away. The Green Dragon said lightly, &ldquo;are you going to let these people go? &quot;</p>
<p>The ghost King smiled and said, &ldquo;these young disciples are of no importance. Besides, we are not here to fight with the righteous people! &quot;</p>
<p>Qinglong nodded, looked up in the air, and said, &ldquo;these two people were the five people that Qingyun gate chased and killed in the wilderness, right? &quot;</p>
<p>The ghost king said, &ldquo;yes, Taoist Cangsong, it&rsquo;s not easy to land. There are Shang Zhengliang and Zeng Shuchang, plus a ten thousand swords one, these five people. &quot;</p>
<p>Qinglong sighed softly and said, &ldquo;a hundred years have passed in a hurry. These young people who were still determined to kill in those days are all alone now. &quot;</p>
<p>The ghost King smiled and said, &ldquo;brother long, there was something wrong with you. Otherwise, there were four holy envoys. In the first battle of Qingyun Mountain, our holy religion may not be able to recover the defeat, but at least it will not be so miserable! &quot;</p>
<p>Qinglong shook his head and said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s impossible. A hundred years ago, when the three great sects of Taoism were at their peak, those old and immortal people came out of the mountains one after another, and we can&rsquo;t resist them. However, haha, it&rsquo;s funny that for thousands of years, we were killed by those five people in the wild temple. For a while, it&rsquo;s all the rage. &quot;</p>
<p>The ghost king was silent for a moment and said slowly, &ldquo;yes, I was not in the temple because I wanted to take care of the previous ghost king. But I also heard that the scene was very ugly. It&rsquo;s a pity that all the experts in the temple were sent out in the battle of Qingyun Mountain. They were killed and injured countless times. Otherwise, they would be killed and injured. &quot;</p>
<p>At that time I was in the temple. &quot;</p>
<p>The ghost king was shocked and said, &ldquo;what? Brother long, were you in the temple at that time? &quot;</p>
<p>Blue Dragon smiled bitterly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s true. In fact, it&rsquo;s not only Xuanwu, the big lazy ghost, but also white tiger and Zhuque. &quot;</p>
<p>The ghost King&rsquo;s face changed. He forced a smile and said, &ldquo;why didn&rsquo;t you recognize these two people just now, brother long? &quot;</p>
<p>The green dragon smiled bitterly again and said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s also a shame.</p>
<p>At that time, these five people rushed all the way into the wilderness, but they still rushed to the temple. At that time, the whole wasteland was shaking and shocked. Although I had always been at odds with the longevity hall and the ten thousand poisons gate, which guarded the temple, I had no relationship with the white tiger and the Zhuque. But maintaining the temple is the first thing, so we guard it together with other experts of all schools. &quot;</p>
<p>The ghost king looked at the sky and said, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter? Are these five people so high in Taoism a hundred years ago? &quot;</p>
<p>Qinglong shook his head and said, &ldquo;in fact, it&rsquo;s not always true. After the situation has changed, I think about it carefully. In fact, after our defeat in Qingyun Mountain, there were so many experts killed and injured that people were scared. I was killed by these five people at random. For a while, I thought that a large number of people and horses had been killed in the right way. I was afraid of not fighting, but I didn&rsquo;t expect that there were only five people. &quot;</p>
<p>He said that. After a pause, he said, &ldquo;of the five, I only had a picture with Wan Jian, so I didn&rsquo;t recognize the other four. At that time, they rushed into the temple, but five people made five separate roads and rushed in from all directions. We were caught off guard. In my heart, I was anxious and afraid. I heard the sound of shouting to kill around. The square inch was already in disorder. If we had been calm in the battle, we would have won. Unfortunately, alas! It&rsquo;s a pity that one of them is a ten thousand swords one. &quot;</p>
<p>The ghost King frowned and said, &ldquo;how is this man? &quot;</p>
<p>The blue dragon&rsquo;s eyes were closed, and he was silent for a moment. He took a long breath and shook his head and said, &ldquo;this man is the most amazing talent in my life. After the discussion, we all thought that although the other four people were good at Taoism, they were quite different from Wan Jian. It can be said that without him, these guys of Qingyun sect would not have rushed into our wilderness, let alone killed our temple. &quot;</p>
<p>Looking at the look of Qinglong, he seemed to be immersed in memories and yearned for something faintly: &ldquo;at that time, the other four people rushed in from the side to the back, but we gathered our main force in the main gate temple, and we were hesitating and shocked. At this time, wanjian was alone and rushed in with his sword.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost King frowned and said, &ldquo;he alone? &quot;</p>
<p>The green dragon sighed and said, &ldquo;yes, he is alone. I still remember when he was as white as snow and as green as water! Yes, it&rsquo;s the Dragon cutting sword! I haven&rsquo;t seen you for a hundred years. I can hardly recognize you. &quot;</p>
<p>The ghost king was surprised, and saw that green dragon pointed forward with his left hand, but it was Lin Jingyu who was fighting in the field. He saw that the green dragon cutting sword was like autumn water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this dragon cutting sword originally in the hands of wanjian? &quot;</p>
<p>Green Dragon nodded and said, &ldquo;yes, it&rsquo;s in his hand. At that time, I asked aloud, but he didn&rsquo;t say a word. He just kept laughing and rushed into our crowd, fighting and fighting, unstoppable. Tut, tut, ah! What a hero! &quot;</p>
<p>The ghost King nodded his head, and his face was also full of admiration. He said, &ldquo;this man is really powerful and bold. What happened later? &quot;</p>
<p>Green Dragon said, &ldquo;we are all frightened and angry, but we are afraid that besides him, there are also righteous experts about to enter. Moreover, the sound of killing after the temple is getting closer and closer, and we are even more frightened. In panic, he rushed to the main hall where the virgin of Youming and the emperor of Tiansha were worshipped. &quot;</p>
<p>The ghost King&rsquo;s calm and calm look suddenly changed and lost his voice. &ldquo;What? &quot;</p>
<p>The green dragon smiled bitterly and said, &ldquo;even you have responded this way. You can imagine how angry we were at that time. This time, no matter what other experts can&rsquo;t come, all the people rush to him like crazy, and any magic weapon to watch the house is used. In a short time, his white clothes are dyed red with blood. But he didn&rsquo;t turn around and rushed straight into the temple. He jumped up and flew to the two statues of the virgin and the king of heaven. On the white wall between the two statues, Sheng Sheng engraved three characters of his ten thousand swords! &quot;</p>
<p>The ghost king was dumbfounded.</p>
<p>The green dragon suddenly said, &ldquo;the rosefinch has always been covered in black, you know? &quot;</p>
<p>The ghost king was slightly surprised and said, &ldquo;yes, what&rsquo;s the matter? &quot;</p>
<p>Qinglong said, &ldquo;she is the only woman among the four of us, but she is the most devout to serve the two saints. At that time, I only saw that she was the first one to rush up regardless of everything, taking advantage of the blink of an eye when wanjian engraved words. A knife then cut down, unexpectedly cut down Wan Jianyi&rsquo;s left hand. &quot;</p>
<p>The ghost king is surprised again.</p>
<p>Green Dragon sighed and said, &ldquo;you are surprised too! At that time, we were all shocked, because when wanjian rushed in, it was too powerful. We didn&rsquo;t expect that he would become a powerful force against many of us. Unexpectedly, although his left hand was broken and his blood was like a spring, he did not change color except for his pale face.</p>
<p>On the contrary, she turned around and got close to the rosefinch. She lifted her veil and looked at it. Then she laughed and said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s really a gorgeous beauty! Then he took control of the Dragon cutting sword and rushed out again. &quot;</p>
<p>The ghost King shook his head and said, &ldquo;how could he have killed him? &quot;</p>
<p>The green dragon sighed, &ldquo;one is that he is too strong, even though his arms are broken and the blood on the temple is flying, his sword power seems to be stronger than the past; the other is the four guys of the green cloud gate. After the temple, there was a fire and smoke. We are afraid that there are more righteous people who are in a panic and are in a hurry to put out the fire, and are actually rushed out by him. &quot;</p>
<p>The ghost King took a long breath and said, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe there are such heroes in the right way! &quot;</p>
<p>The Green Dragon said faintly, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a pity that the hero is really successful, but he has nothing to do with it. That day, when we found out that only five people from Qingyun sect had rushed in, we were really angry. But I can also see that those guys of Wandu gate and Changsheng hall scold fiercely, but they are extremely surprised to admire wanjian. Especially my junior sister Zhuque, alas! &quot;</p>
<p>He seemed to think of something, but he didn&rsquo;t go on talking. Instead, he said, &ldquo;at that time, we all thought that in Qingyun sect, it must be this person who took over the position of the leader. Unexpectedly, it was not long before we heard that it was his elder martial brother daoxuan who took over the position. After that. This amazing character has no news from now on. Until today, I know that he has died. &quot;</p>
<p>When he said that, he was very sorry.</p>
<p>The ghost King smiled and said, &ldquo;yes, but it&rsquo;s a pity that he can&rsquo;t compete with such heroes. It&rsquo;s a pity in his life. &quot;</p>
<p>Qinglong looked up and looked at the air, then sneered and said, &ldquo;Duanmu and baiduzi, these guys, were defeated from Qingyun Mountain and fled to the wilderness. Before they arrived at the temple, they met five first-class people of wanjian. They were beaten and fled. Even the temple dared not go back. It was shameless that they dared to ask loudly if wanjian had come! &quot;</p>
<p>The ghost King smiled and said, &ldquo;they are just the running dogs of the old monster in the ten thousand poisons gate. Why are you angry, brother long! &quot;</p>
<p>Qinglong reached out his hand and brushed his white clothes lightly. He said lightly, &ldquo;it was a great shame for our saints to have been intruded into the temple by wanjian. After a hundred years of hard work, I was willing to take a great risk to find the heaven and earth light ring, so that I could decide with him again one day.</p>
<p>Today, I heard that he has passed away. I only feel disappointed and sorry, but I don&rsquo;t want these people to say such shameless words as digging graves and corpses. It&rsquo;s shame to be with him! &quot;</p>
<p>The ghost King shook his head and smiled, looked up and watched the battle, but saw that the light in the sky was more and more prosperous, and almost all the four figures could not be seen. And the dark clouds in the sky, at the moment, are almost all reflected by the light of their magic weapon.</p>
<p>The sky is speechless, only in the distant sea, the sound of the long roar is gradually bleak.</p>
<p>The ghost king suddenly frowned and turned to the green dragon and said, &ldquo;do you think the night tonight is strange? &quot;</p>
<p>Green Dragon looked up and was silent for a moment. Suddenly he moved and said, &ldquo;you mean</p>
<p>The ghost King nodded and said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s said that every time the strange beast comes out, the heaven and the earth will change color, accompanied by great wind and rain. Therefore, it is recorded in the ancient book that this thing is the mount of thunderobot. &quot;</p>
<p>The blue dragon&rsquo;s face gradually became solemn and frowned, &ldquo;how could it be so unlucky, tonight? &quot;</p>
<p>The ghost King pondered for a moment and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been on Liubo mountain for some time, but I haven&rsquo;t heard this strange noise in the past. I&rsquo;m afraid that Kui Niu will be born tonight. It seems that we should make preparations early. &quot;</p>
<p>Qinglong nodded slowly and said, &ldquo;yes, Kui Niu is a big problem, so I&rsquo;ll give it to the people of the ten thousand poison gate. Hey, as long as Kui Niu is subdued, there are three other spirit beasts, ours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost king suddenly coughed and the green dragon was stunned. Then he laughed and shook his head. He said, &ldquo;this hundred years of hard work has made people stupid. Ha ha, master, don&rsquo;t be surprised! &quot;</p>
<p>The ghost King smiled, turned around and walked away. He no longer looked back at the people who were still fighting fiercely.</p>
<p>Qinglong glanced at the distance, but saw that the orthodox disciples left one after another and gradually disappeared into the forest. He could not help but vaguely touched his mind. With a sigh, he turned around and followed the ghost king.</p>
<p>The night is silent, but it seems that there are countless ferocious eyes in the dark. When people are running, they don&rsquo;t know where the howling sound comes from. It rises far away and reverberates in the deep forest, accompanied by the unknown mysterious roar in the sea.</p>
<p>This night, it looks very sad!</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan, Tian linger, song Daren, he Dazhi and Du Bishu, five of them, are flying rapidly in the forest.</p>
<p>Originally, it would be much faster for them to control the magic weapon and go up to the sky. But just now they rushed out of the encirclement of disciples of the demon sect. Just when they wanted to fly up, they saw a few disciples of a small school flying up with them. Suddenly, several fierce lights came out of the dense forest under their feet, and Sheng Sheng beat them down.</p>
<p>Those bleak shouts, I can&rsquo;t live.</p>
<p>People lose color. Now the forest is full of branches and leaves. It&rsquo;s late at night. There are so many people in the surrounding demon sect. If they are found flying up, they will be living targets.</p>
<p>Song Daren, as a senior brother, after all, compared with several junior brothers and sisters, saw the world and decided to fly in the woods. Although it&rsquo;s dark here, it&rsquo;s hard to find the disciples of the demon sect, but the other side can&rsquo;t see themselves. As long as we fly to the East, once we get out of the forest and get out of the demon sect&rsquo;s encirclement, it&rsquo;s much safer.</p>
<p>As soon as they thought about it, the five of them flew to the East with all their strength.</p>
<p>Song Daren takes the lead, Zhang Xiaofan follows at the end, everyone concentrates on controlling the magic weapon and shuttles through the forest.</p>
<p>At the moment, Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s chest is still slightly painful, but the injury he suffered when fighting with the old blood sucking demon just now is not as heavy as he thought. From the XuanHuo Jian tied to his right arm, from time to time, there is a little warm Yuanyang Qi, swimming slowly in his own body, which seems to have a special ability to restrain the strange blood sucking skill of the old blood sucking demon.</p>
<p>However, although the xuanhuojian secretly restrained the evil power of the blood sucking Dharma, Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s strange cold feeling from the fire stick conflicts with the xuanhuojian when he is flying forward with the fire stick. In his body, two different Qi repel after contact, but the xuanhuojian is not driven by Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s spiritual power after all, so it is quickly suppressed by the cold Qi of the fire stick.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s whole spirit is now on the flight with his elder martial brother and elder martial sister. Naturally, he will not notice these small changes in his body. He only looks up in the flight gap, but sees the dark clouds in the sky, turning over like boiling water, bursts of milli light, straight nine days, reflecting most of the sky red.</p>
<p>There, of course, is the place where Shifu Tian is not easy to fight with his uncle, Taoist Cangsong, and the demon sect demon. I don&rsquo;t know if he will be OK?</p>
<p>Thinking of this, Zhang Xiaofan immediately shook his head, thinking that Shifu&rsquo;s Taoism is so high, of course, it will be OK. It&rsquo;s just his own multi-minded. After laughing at his own worries, Zhang Xiaofan cheered up and quickened his pace to keep up with his elder martial brother and elder sister.</p>
<p>In front of us, the darkness is like a boundless net, which is long without any edge. Gradually, the five of them were far away from the noisy fighting sounds, and they fell into the darkness, and even the surrounding area became quiet.</p>
<p>In the night, it seems that there is only the darkness in front of them. On the sea near them, the mysterious and shrill roar is clearer and closer. (to be continued. )</p>
