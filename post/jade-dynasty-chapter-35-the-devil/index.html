      <p>The Dharma phase stood in front of him and whispered a Buddha&rsquo;s name. A moment later, a round bead flashing with Zhuang&rsquo;s serious Mu Jinguang sacrificed from his hand. At first, the light seemed to be attached to the Dharma phase. But with the urging of Dharma phase, the golden light was very prosperous. The golden light rushed to all directions like tide water with the bead as the center. Zhang Xiaofan stood in the same place and almost mistakenly felt the &ldquo;shout&rdquo; in his ear Roaring, the Golden Circle of light had passed by him.</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s face on the scene was reflected in a light golden color. At the same time, everyone was in a good mood. Even though they were a little nervous, they fell flat in an instant. Such a large space is as bright as day in a twinkling of an eye. If it&rsquo;s not for the monstrous rocks and the creeping bats, it almost makes people think that it&rsquo;s the best place for Buddhism.</p>
<p>Li Xun, who always has eyes higher than the top, is a little surprised at the moment. Standing aside, he says: &ldquo;reincarnation beads!&rdquo;</p>
<p>FA Xiang took a look at him and said, &ldquo;elder martial brother Li has good eyesight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li Xun seems to be a little more polite to FA Xiang suddenly in his words, saying: &ldquo;no, you are the senior brother of FA Xiang.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this time, Zhang Xiaofan, with the light of &ldquo;reincarnation bead&rdquo;, saw clearly that he had stepped on the clean hard ground under his feet. Looking up, he saw that the black bats disappeared on the top of the rock cave, but the &ldquo;rustling&rdquo; sound was still clearly in his ears.</p>
<p>He looked twice more carefully, and then found that at the top of the cave behind him, countless black bats still gathered at the top of the cave, but just above the hard ground where several of them were treading, the rock at the top of the cave had a red thin line across the top of the cave, which looked like a vein growing in the rock.</p>
<p>With this red thin line as the boundary, countless bats are crowded outside, but none of them cross the red line, and there is no smelly bat feces outside just a short distance below.</p>
<p>FA Xiang looked around and said in a deep voice, &ldquo;there are so many strange things here. You must be careful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>People don&rsquo;t know how, but they finally step on a clean place. After checking that there is nothing different around, most people&rsquo;s first action is to tidy up their clothes. Zeng Shushu, standing next to Zhang Xiaofan, takes off his shoes. Pour out the disgusting things inside and whisper to Zhang Xiaofan, &ldquo;I know for the first time in my life that it&rsquo;s so comfortable to walk on a clean road!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan smiled and quickly cleaned up. The whole person feels better. After a while, when Qihao saw that everyone was almost all right, he said, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo; He said that he should go to the deep cave first.</p>
<p>They all followed, and soon followed their footsteps. Behind it, there is endless darkness.</p>
<p>And in front, as if the dark beast, open arms to show a ferocious smile, welcome their arrival.</p>
<p>A little light in the dark, slowly moving forward.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know how far it has gone. This ancient and deep cave seems to have no end. Although it has been very spacious, it has twists and turns, except for leaning to the bottom of the earth. It&rsquo;s almost impossible to tell the direction.</p>
<p>The rustle of bats at the cave entrance has long been out of earshot. In the darkness, there is no other sound except the footsteps of others. Zhang Xiaofan feels that the humidity around him is getting heavier and heavier, and he doesn&rsquo;t know how deep it is.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;reincarnation bead&rdquo; of the Dharma offering still radiates Golden Buddha light and shines on the people. At this time, Qi Hao, the foremost, also sacrificed the Six Harmonies mirror in case of emergency. Two kinds of treasures complement each other. After a while, Qi Hao, who has been walking ahead, suddenly stops. Reach out to the back and say, &ldquo;slow down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the people stopped at once.</p>
<p>There was a silence and no sound.</p>
<p>The light of &ldquo;reincarnation bead&rdquo; and &ldquo;Six Harmonies mirror&rdquo; gradually brightened up, in front of everyone&rsquo;s eyes, in front of the cave. Huoran opened two branches of the road, deep, dark, I do not know where to go, as if the devil opened the mouth. In the middle of the road, it is also the center of two fork roads. There is a huge stone tablet with six people in height, on which four big blood red characters are carved:</p>
<p>Heaven is on me!</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Li Xun of the burning incense Valley hummed and said angrily, &ldquo;the demon of the demon sect, dare to call heaven&rsquo;s way in vain!&rdquo;</p>
<p>FA Xiang frowned and looked at the stone tablet for a few more times. He said, &ldquo;I heard the words of master Puhong when I came here. There was such a stone tablet in the cave of the demon cult eight hundred years ago, but it was cut open by the immortal of my righteous way with a sword of great power. See you today. How can it be intact?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this time, Gu Yanhong, who had been silent, suddenly said, &ldquo;look at the quarter under the stone tablet, but there is a broken mark?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her voice is soft and beautiful. It sounds like a swing in one&rsquo;s heart. In addition, everyone in Qingyun sect is surprised when they hear Yan Hong&rsquo;s opening for the first time. When they went up and looked carefully, they saw that there was a slight crack in that place, slanting upward, and dividing the whole stone tablet into two parts. The stone texture at the crack was dark red, but if they did not look carefully, they could not see it.</p>
<p>Qi Hao nodded and said to Yan Hong, &ldquo;younger martial sister Yan has a fine heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yan Hong smiled and bowed her head to stop talking.</p>
<p>Qi Hao looked at the stone tablet again and turned to all the people and said, &ldquo;since the stone tablet has been repaired, it can be seen that most of the demons and demons of the demon cult are here to do some shady business. We are right this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>FA Xiang then said: &ldquo;elder martial brother Qi is right. There are dangers in the cave. There is a problem in front of us. Which one should we take for these two roads?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Qi Haowei pondered and said, &ldquo;elder martial brother Faxiang, you just said that monk lingpuhong had mentioned the things here to you. Did he mention the fork in the road?&rdquo;</p>
<p>FA Xiang nodded his head and said: &ldquo;the teacher did say that, but he also learned from the ancestors. It is said that when the devil war was going on, the two roads were followed by the den of demons. As for the current situation, he is not very clear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everyone was silent. After a while, Qi Hao looked at the other three people in the gate and said, &ldquo;in that case, I think it&rsquo;s better to divide the army into two parts. Four of us in Qingyun gate look at the left side of the road, and two of us, FA Xiang, FA Shan, and Fen Xiang Valley, look at the right side of the road. If you meet a demon cult demon, you will be alerted with a long cry. What about that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Dharma phase is silent. Although it is clear that such a separation is not a good thing, the cave is deep, and I don&rsquo;t know how far the two roads are. If I go wrong and go back again, I&rsquo;m afraid that there will be too much delay. And the people present are all elites of all schools, so they may not be able to protect themselves. At present, he turned to look at Li Xun and Yan Hong of the burning incense Valley, and saw that they had no objection. &ldquo;Then according to elder martial brother Qi, you must be careful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he said this, he took another look at Zhang Xiaofan.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan felt that brother Faxiang really looked at him differently. But still smile on your face.</p>
<p>Qi Hao nodded and threw a fist at the French, then took Zhang Xiaofan and other three people to the left side of the road. Without taking a few steps, the light behind turned. It also gradually disappeared. It seems that the people of fahei have also entered the right fork.</p>
<p>Qi Hao walked at the front, sacrificing the six mirror to the top of his head, urging Xianli, sprinkling the light yellow diaphragm of the six mirror, and covering the four people in the middle.</p>
<p>This fork road is much narrower than the cave that just came along. At the same time, the rocks on both sides are abrupt and sharp. Zhang Xiaofan almost hung the color accidentally. The only thing that is the same is the eternal darkness around. Here, it seems that there has never been a glimmer of light.</p>
<p>All four of them are not in the mood to talk, especially Qi Hao, who is at the forefront, is more attentive to prevent the unknown danger ahead.</p>
<p>It was such a long walk that Zhang Xiaofan couldn&rsquo;t help wondering whether he would hear it from senior brother Faxiang, even if he met a demon cult demon and made a long cry.</p>
<p>This is the moment. Sudden changes, people walking in the corridor, as if the eternal darkness and quiet around, suddenly sounded a huge &ldquo;Wuwu&rdquo; ghost cry. It&rsquo;s deafening and frightening.</p>
<p>The four were shocked. Qi Hao was just about to open his mouth to remind him that when he was shocked, he could only see the light of different colors from the endless darkness in all directions. At the same time, he rushed to the aisle where the four people were, hitting the six mirror aperture.</p>
<p>The power is so great that even the Liuhe mirror is shaking. Qi Hao is shocked. He is speechless. He quickly calms down his mind and strengthens his protection.</p>
<p>The cry of the ghost is louder and louder. I can hear Qi Hao&rsquo;s head is dazed. Zeng Shushu, Lu Xueqi and Zhang Xiaofan protect Qi Hao in the center. They see countless lights are shocked back by the six mirror. They turn a corner in the air. They turn back and rush again. In the dark, they don&rsquo;t know how many enemies are hiding or how many magic weapons are flying in the air.</p>
<p>Qi Hao&rsquo;s face was pale, and his hands tightly grasped the formula. Although surrounded by external magic weapons, the six directions mirror was gradually stable, and the aperture was gradually full. Just when the people in Qingyun gate were about to breathe a sigh of relief, Zhang Xiaofan suddenly found that the hard ground under his feet had moved.</p>
<p>Before he could react, he heard Zeng Shushu cry out, &ldquo;be careful, you have it under your feet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before they finished speaking, a loud noise overwhelmed the roar of the sky. All of a sudden, people felt that the mountains were shaking and the earth was surging out of their feet. They blew the ground to pieces. The four people in Qingyun gate flew all over the place. The six mirror could protect the surrounding, but they could not prevent the foot. It was hard for them to be inside. The light was scattered and fell back to Qi Hao&rsquo;s figure.</p>
<p>In the dark, countless lights roared past, as if they were making a triumphant laugh, and rushed to the four separate people.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan stood in front of him and was pushed by the strong force from his feet, so the whole person could not help but fly forward. However, after many years of practice in Qingyun gate, he was shocked but not disordered. He put the fire stick in his hand to his chest, and the feeling of being familiar with the ice was all over his body. &ldquo;Fire staff&rdquo; in the middle of the air gives out a light dark green luster, is facing the rear closely chasing several rays of light.</p>
<p>A moment later, one of the dark red lights rushed to the front. Zhang Xiaofan suddenly smelled a bloody smell and was about to vomit. He quickly held his breath and drove the fire stick. The dark green light rose to resist the dark red light. Under the light of the fire stick, somehow, the dark red light suddenly dimmed a lot.</p>
<p>Unknown in the dark, suddenly came a low voice of wonder.</p>
<p>At this time, two other lights, one yellow and one gray, rushed over and hit the fire stick together. Zhang Xiaofan saw clearly by the light. The dark red light just now was a dark red fork with thick bloodstains. The yellow light was a three foot long sword, but the gray light was strange. It was a huge unknown beast tusk!</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s body was still in the air, and he was already stable. Unexpectedly, he was hit by these three magic weapons. Although there was a &ldquo;fire stick&rdquo; in the air, the huge force was that he pushed his whole person straight back and couldn&rsquo;t control it any more. He hit heavily on the side of the stone wall, and half of the people fell in, and the stone chips flew.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s eyes were full of Venus, and his back hurt. But he knew that it was a life and death moment. He tried to bite his teeth to hold back the pain and fell to the ground. He saw the three deadly things turning in the air. It was a vicious rush.</p>
<p>In the dark, where are those who control the magic weapon?</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan is clumsy on the left and right. He shouts with a clench, and the fire stick rises in the air. In the middle of the air, they collided with the fangs of the Yellow flying sword beast. With a loud noise, they shook away. Then they rushed forward and opened up. The other dark red fork that came after them failed. With a bang, he hit the stone wall behind the place where he had just stood. The gravel flew in disorder, and he made a big hole in the stone wall.</p>
<p>At this time, the gray tusks are recovered. When they are smashed down, the teeth with cold light are particularly striking in the dark. Look at its momentum, Zhang Xiaofan doesn&rsquo;t want to know the consequences of this strange magic weapon hitting himself.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan clenched his teeth, scratched his hands in the void, and the fire stick moved at will with a flash of blue light. He appeared on the top of his head and hit the tusk. In the middle of the air, he heard a low, muffled sound. There was a crack on the tusk.</p>
<p>In the distance, there was a exclamation, which was full of regret and consternation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that Zhang Xiaofan has no time to recollect this little bit of poor joy. The Yellow flying sword has rushed to him again in a flash. Zhang Xiaofan can&rsquo;t react. His forehead is sweating and he shouts out in a critical moment. As soon as the hands shake, the whole person floats up and melts into the dark light of the fire staff.</p>
<p>The Yellow flying sword is a turn in the air. From the bottom of his feet, he rushed up again, with fangs on the top and flying swords on the bottom. Zhang Xiaofan was shivering all over. He could not think more, and he shrank. Recite the mantra in your mouth, and let the fire stick shine, and wrap it around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boom&rdquo;, two loud sounds almost at the same time, respectively, sounded at the foot of Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s head, and two magic weapons of the enemy rushed back. The staff trembled in the air. Zhang Xiaofan gasped for breath. His heart almost stopped beating at that moment. During the illusion of that moment, he almost unconsciously thought that he saw the staff split into pieces.</p>
<p>Fortunately, though the fire stick of unknown material is ugly, it&rsquo;s extremely tough and intact. It&rsquo;s just that the flying sword and tusk are dim and mostly damaged. But that said, when the fire staff was hit hard, the green light to protect Zhang Xiaofan disappeared.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan is about to recall the burning stick. Suddenly, a sharp pain comes from his shoulder. His body is weak and his mind is blank. Lowering his head, he saw only a small dark red fork on his chest and shoulders, which was penetrating and gushing with blood.</p>
<p>It was the dark red fork that attacked Zhang Xiaofan while he was slack.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan saw only the fork. The dark red color seemed to light up at the moment, as if he smelled the smell of blood and woke up. With a low voice, he wanted to stretch out his hand and pull out the fork. Suddenly, with the deepening of the blood trace on the dark red fork, a shadow in the dark seemed to be born out of nothing. He jumped up from the fork and then tightly attached to Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s back.</p>
<p>The owner of the dark red fork saw that it was parasitic on the magic weapon.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan felt dizzy and unable to get rid of the demon behind him. In addition to the pain in the wound, there is also a tingling feeling at the moment. I&rsquo;m afraid that there is still a lot of poison on it. He could not see the face of the demon behind him, but saw his hands tightly on his shoulder. They were dry, dirty and smelly.</p>
<p>In the distance, there was a wild laugh, and behind it, there was a voice of yin and compassion: &ldquo;the stinky boy of Qingyun gate, this is your own way to die. Give me the blood essence obediently!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan had no time to reflect the meaning of his words, so he understood from his actions. He saw that the demon in the shadow opened his big mouth and bit on Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s left neck, sucking blood. At the same time, the dark red fork was brighter, as if he was drinking blood.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was extremely frightened, but he felt that his blood was flowing towards his throat, his body felt light, and his strength was slowly dispersing. Even the fire stick in the middle of the air was unable to support him and fell down.</p>
<p>This scene, trance, he suddenly seems to be back to the past, that a valley.</p>
<p>In that nightmare!</p>
<p>When the fire stick fell from his head and fell in front of him, it gave off a light blue light, like calling something. Zhang Xiaofan seized it, and felt the chill on the fire stick surging like fury.</p>
<p>The blood on his body kept flowing out and was sucked by the demon. Zhang Xiaofan could not hear any sound from the outside world at the moment, but he tried to get up the last strength of his body, just like a trapped beast, to insert the flashing fire stick into the demon behind him.</p>
<p>The fire staff is blunt and has no edge, but at the moment, it looks like the flesh and blood body is just like tofu, and it&rsquo;s inserted into it as if it&rsquo;s broken.</p>
<p>The demon body behind him shuddered and stopped sucking blood, which seemed unbelievable. He turned to look at Zhang Xiaofan, who saw him at the same time.</p>
<p>In the dark, it&rsquo;s like the low sneer of nine hell demons, or the heart beat of someone in the dark. Zhang Xiaofan holds the hand of the fire stick, and feels the wave of heart beat, like the flow of blood, or the joy of demons!</p>
<p>The light on the dark red fork quickly dimmed down. Behind it, endless darkness rushed over.</p>
<p>At the moment when the darkness engulfed Zhang Xiaofan and the demon, Zhang Xiaofan saw a scene that he could not forget in his life under the half coma.</p>
<p>The monster&rsquo;s wrinkled but still full face shriveled in a moment, turning flesh and blood into dry skin and attaching to the bone.</p>
<p>The next moment, darkness surrounded him.</p>
<p>The lost was regained, and a constant stream of strength came from the body of the fire stick and melted into his body.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan regained consciousness, but was stunned at the local place. The shoulder injury was still painful, but the gushing blood had stopped under the unknown force, but for this young man, at the moment, he did not pay attention to these. There was only one thought in his mind:</p>
<p>What did I do? What did I do? (to be continued. )</p>
