<p>The token is dark, but in the middle of the token, there is a raised word &ldquo;Fa&rdquo;. When you look at it, you can&rsquo;t help but feel a sense of awe.</p>
<p>While Bai Xiaochun was stunned, a cold voice came out of the token and reverberated throughout the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bai Xiaochun, a disciple of the outer gate, has been investigated by the law enforcement hall. You have only completed one mission of planting and cultivating spiritual plants for several years, which violates the rules of the sect. Therefore, you should go out after three days of forced enlistment, without any mistakes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The voice is cold and cold. It seems that if Bai Xiaochun dares to refuse, then waiting for him will be the severe punishment of the law enforcement hall!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Law enforcement hall!&rdquo; When Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s eyes suddenly stare up and his heart is pounding, the token turns into a black awn and disappears.</p>
<p>There was silence all around, and Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s face was constantly changing. After taking out his identity token, he found that there was a task that he had to complete.</p>
<p>He did neglect the task of completing the task at least once a year. However, the token of the law enforcement hall came suddenly. No matter how he thought about it, Bai Xiaochun felt that it was strange.</p>
<p>He was silent for a moment, walked out of the room, left the medicine refining Pavilion, and went straight to the top of the mountain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not right. I always feel chilly behind my back I&rsquo;ve been climbing the mountain for many years, and I&rsquo;ve never taken the initiative to find the palm seat. I&rsquo;m going to visit this time and ask what&rsquo;s going on. &quot; Bai Xiaochun was very worried all the way, but when she got to the top of the mountain, she asked Li Qinghou&rsquo;s daotong, but she learned that Li Qinghou had gone out a few months ago and has not returned.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun is distressed and upset. When she turns to leave, she doesn&rsquo;t go back to the medicine refining Pavilion immediately. Instead, she goes to find Xu Baocai. After all, Bai Xiaochun thinks that she can get some clues from her partner.</p>
<p>As a disciple of Xiangyun mountain, Xu Baocai lives in the yard on the other side of the mountain. Bai Xiaochun is speeding along. At this moment, the sky is getting dark, and there are few people on the way. He soon arrives outside Xu Baocai&rsquo;s yard.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not as secluded as Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s yard, but it&rsquo;s next to seven or eight yards. Now in the night, you can see the light of candlelight in these yards. [love to go to the small</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun bowed his head and didn&rsquo;t knock on the door. He jumped in and saw what Xu Baocai was writing on a small book.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Xu Baocai.</p>
<p>”Bai Xiaochun opens his mouth in a low voice. As soon as he says something, Xu Baocai is startled. He suddenly looks up to see Bai Xiaochun, and then he reacts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elder martial brother Bai.&rdquo; Xu Baocai was surprised and quickly got up and let Bai Xiaochun enter the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elder martial brother Bai is closed in the medicine refining Pavilion. How did he come to me?&rdquo; Xu Baocai asked curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Xu Baocai, how much do you know about law enforcement hall?&rdquo; Xiaochun opened her mouth immediately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Law enforcement hall? It is divided into two halls, the north and the south, each of which has the right to supervise all the external disciples and laborers in their respective areas. However, they will not come forward unless they have committed some serious sect rules. &quot; Xu Baocai felt that something was wrong. Seeing Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s gloomy face, he spoke quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But once they come out, they have great power. They can arrange things by force. For those who have defected to the sect, they can kill them directly. In a word, the law enforcement hall is a knife, a knife hanging on the top of the disciples of the outer gate, so that no one of the outer disciples dare to violate the rules.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once you break the rules, if you are caught in the eye of the law enforcement hall, you will be stripped of a layer of skin if you do not die&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;However, although the law enforcement hall has a lot of rights, it can also have many restrictions. As long as it does not violate the rules, it is unnecessary to pay attention to the law enforcement hall.&rdquo; Xu Baocai told Bai Xiaochun all the information he knew about the law enforcement hall.</p>
<p>Even with that, he also told Bai Xiaochun all he heard about the students who were followed by the law enforcement hall, and the final tragedy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five hundred years ago, there was a traitor in our Lingxi sect. He was chased and killed by the law enforcement hall for seven days. His body and soul were destroyed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three hundred years ago, a disciple of an outside school committed a major mistake. The law enforcement hall gave him an opportunity, but he did not know how to repent and ignored it. As a result, he was reported by the law enforcement hall to the zongmen and was punished in the black tuyere. He was torn by the wind all day long. He is still being punished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A hundred years ago, Zhoushan road rebelled, and after the law enforcement hall warned, the other side still did not know how to repent, so they went out to kill all monks except ordinary people, which caused a sensation in all directions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The more pure, the more ugly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean that when law enforcement agencies do things, they usually warn them first. If they don&rsquo;t repent, they will deal with them severely?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, this is one of the restrictions on the law enforcement hall. Otherwise, the law enforcement hall would have no power.&rdquo; Xu Baocai takes a look at Bai Xiaochun and guesses from the bottom of his heart that the other party may be targeted by the law enforcement court, but this matter is too sensitive. Xu Baocai is wise to protect himself and say some news, but he does not dare to participate too much.</p>
<p>But at last, when Bai Xiaochun was about to leave, Xu Baocai hesitated for a moment. He thought of Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s attainments in vegetation and said a word to Bai Xiaochun in a low voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elder martial brother Bai, do you know the inner disciples of Qingfeng mountain Qian Dajin? He is Chen Fei&rsquo;s cousin. He is also a member of the law enforcement hall. &quot;</p>
<p>After a stick of incense, Bai Xiaochun leaves and walks on the path of zongmen. Looking at the bright moon in the sky, Bai Xiaochun thinks about what Xu Baocai said and confirms them one by one with his previous understanding. After confirming that it is true, Bai Xiaochun sighs deeply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t offend anyone in my family. If I did, Chen Fei would be one of them, and then I would be Zhou Xinqi&rsquo;s admirers Money, money, money Bai Xiaochun bit his teeth and went back to the medicine refining Pavilion. He sat cross legged in the room and looked at the furnace in front of him. His face twitched.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s almost clear that I didn&rsquo;t finish my annual task, which was an incentive. In fact, if no one came to check, it would not be a big deal. After all, I couldn&rsquo;t have done it alone. As a member of the law enforcement hall, Qian Dajin took revenge on himself.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun was silent. After a long time, there was blood in his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I go to carry out a task, this person will certainly have some action on the way. Otherwise, it will not take so much thought. But even so, it is hidden after all. He dare not let the zongmen know. Generally speaking, he is passive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if I don&rsquo;t pay attention to it, I&rsquo;ll hit him in the middle. He&rsquo;s not passive. Instead, he can take the initiative to punish me with the status of law enforcement hall!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After thinking for a long time, neither the left nor the right. Bai Xiaochun took out his identity token and studied the task carefully. Soon, he saw a familiar name in it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hou Yunfei?&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun is stunned. He remembers that when he was just a disciple of the outer gate, Hou Yunfei introduced zongmen in detail. After reading, he closed his eyes and pondered.</p>
<p>This task is not difficult. Hou Yunfei took the next task a few years ago and went out to carry out it. He would regularly send back information to the sect every month. This is what any disciple who takes on a long-term task needs to do.</p>
<p>But in two months ago, but lost contact, no information back.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we had the task of asking three disciples from other schools to investigate the matter, but we didn&rsquo;t have to find all the clues.</p>
<p>This kind of task is very common in the clan. Generally speaking, it is enough to search, investigate and find some clues. After reporting to the clan, the clan will deal with it.</p>
<p>Moreover, the disappearance of an outsider&rsquo;s disciple is not too big a matter for the sect, but it is also a disciple of the sect after all, so the missing matter should also be dealt with.</p>
<p>This is the task.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun pondered for a moment, then weighed and bit his teeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This mission, go!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun is short of breath and has red eyes. He wants to make alchemy immediately. When he goes out to carry out the task, he will make his immortal iron sheet Dacheng.</p>
<p>Two days later, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s whole body roared. When he vibrated, his whole body&rsquo;s skin was completely black. At this moment, the black skin quickly returned to normal. When you look carefully, you can see that there is a trace of red on the skin, which flashes away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Black for iron, red for copper!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun pressed her skin and heard the sound of gold and iron. She got up and swayed, faster than ever before.</p>
<p>He tried his strength again. At last, his body leaped in an instant, his thumb and index finger pinched hard, and the lock was broken. What came out of nothingness was no longer a click, but a dull roar. Although it was not big, Bai Xiaochun obviously felt his broken waiting lock, which was more than twice as powerful as ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Immortal iron sheet, Dacheng!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun is excited, and has a better grasp of the task.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity that I can only refine the first-class elixir which is suitable for condensing gas below five layers. Even if it&rsquo;s spirit refining, the effect is not very good.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun stood in the room, feeling a little bit of a pity, but time was pressing. He could not make a second-order elixir suitable for the eighth floor of condensate gas.</p>
<p>Therefore, little progress has been made in the cultivation, but the sixth layer of condensate gas has been completed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow morning, I&rsquo;m going out&hellip;&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun was nervous. After he joined Lingxi sect, it was the first time for him to go out in a real sense. He felt insecure. So he refined the shield he had got from Chen Fei in his pocket for three times. He even felt that it was not safe. He also went to refine the leather clothes xiaobishi was wearing.</p>
<p>Finally, he thought about it again. He went to Zhang daphou all night and borrowed his big black pot, which is said to have a ground fire array. But he was still worried, but there was no other way. Bai Xiaochun, with a sad face, did not go back to the medicine refining Pavilion and sat in his yard waiting for dawn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Qian Dajin, when I get to Zhuji, I will make you look good!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun thought more and more nervous, and gradually his eyes became red. He was afraid of death. Now he is no longer a person who has just entered the sect. He already has a certain understanding of the cultivation world.</p>
<p>A night of daydreaming Gradually, it was dawn.</p>
