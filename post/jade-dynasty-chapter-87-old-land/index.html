      <p>Qingyun Mountain, Dazhu peak.</p>
<p>The cloud is ethereal in the mountains, like the gentle white ribbon, changing gently. In the early morning, the moist air and the fresh and cool wind swept over the green bamboo forest and the mountain top of Dazhu peak.</p>
<p>The building centered on Shoujing hall stands quietly in the morning light. Everything seems so peaceful</p>
<p>Just a burst of barking sound suddenly came, mixed with &ldquo;squeak&rdquo; in the middle, breaking the silence here. The hairy rhubarb comes from the distance, and Xiaohui is riding on its back, holding the hair on the neck of rhubarb tightly to support the body, while the other hand is waving in the air, very excited.</p>
<p>Ten years ago, after Zhang Xiaofan went to Tongtian peak from here, he never came back. At the beginning of a period of time, these two animals have become depressed, especially Xiaohui, who has been restless for a long time. As for rhubarb, it&rsquo;s not easy. I&rsquo;m depressed all day. I don&rsquo;t know if it likes what Zhang Xiaofan cooks too much. During that time, Du Bishu, who cooks instead of Zhang Xiaofan, takes out food to feed them. He must be roared by rhubarb and Xiaohui. After eating, most of them still have white eyes. He&rsquo;s very dissatisfied. Poor Du Bishu has been depressed for a long time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that time is like water, passing by, the memory of that year seems to fade away, and I don&rsquo;t know when to start. Xiaohui and rhubarb start to fight and play on the mountain of Dazhu peak again, but even so, they always return to Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s room when they fall asleep at night, as if expecting something.</p>
<p>Though, for so many years, the room has never been empty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hiss!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rhubarb suddenly stops in the rush, and the huge inertia makes little ash almost fall off its back. Fortunately, its hand is tight enough, which barely stabilizes its body. Rhubarb barked loudly. Suddenly, he turned around, but he opened his mouth and spit out his long tongue to chase his tail. Then he kept turning.</p>
<p>Little ash sat steadily on its back. Grinning with a loud &ldquo;squeak&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s very excited and happy. This boring game rhubarb did not know how many times, but for them, it seems to be the most fun thing.</p>
<p>The twilight of the morning fell on them. The sound of two animals echoed on the big bamboo peak, and people were still sleeping. This great time seemed to be left to them.</p>
<p>Far away, the green bamboo forest in the back mountain.</p>
<p>There was a faint sound of the mountain wind blowing the bamboo leaves, and the sound of the bamboo waves echoed in a long time. Even the wind from that direction seemed to carry the fragrance of the bamboo leaves and the breath of the bamboo forest.</p>
<p>All of a sudden!</p>
<p>Rhubarb stopped chasing its tail. Little ash was on its back, and almost at the same time, he raised his head, opened his mouth, and looked at the bamboo forest.</p>
<p>Green mountain, green bamboo. The wind, like the sea</p>
<p>Sand, sand, sand</p>
<p>&ldquo;Squeak!&rdquo; Xiaohui suddenly screamed, and the reaction of rhubarb was a little strange, but the voice was much smaller, and he barked a few times, but a moment later, the two animals seemed to know something, and Xiaohui grasped the rhubarb. Rhubarb immediately spread out four legs, and quickly ran back to the black bamboo forest in the mountain.</p>
<p>On the familiar back mountain path, perhaps because no one has come here for a long time to do homework, the lush vegetation even the original mountain road is gradually blurred. However, rhubarb seems to be born with spiritual awareness. It shuttles among the trees. The faster it runs, the faster it runs to the front of the bamboo forest.</p>
<p>In the green bamboo forest, deep and mysterious, rhubarb stopped outside the bamboo forest. In a low voice, he called several times, and Xiaohui jumped down from his back, squatted aside, looked at it, and looked at the deep bamboo forest. From time to time, he grabbed his head with his hand, as if he hesitated.</p>
<p>But after a while, Xiaohui finally made up his mind. He called &ldquo;squeak&rdquo; to rhubarb and walked to the bamboo forest first. It was not right to walk, but Xiaohui did not climb the bamboo strangely. Instead, he held it on the ground with his forelegs and walked slowly in a jumping posture. Looking at its appearance, he was careful but full of it Looking forward.</p>
<p>Rhubarb sobbed twice, but also stepped forward, followed it behind, into the bamboo forest.</p>
<p>A monkey and a dog, slowly shuttling in the quiet bamboo forest, soon disappeared.</p>
<p>In the morning, the light is blocked by the dense bamboo leaves, but from the gap, there is still a way of light, turning into a light column as big as a finger, sprinkling from above the bamboo forest and falling on the ground.</p>
<p>Little ash and rhubarb are walking slowly among the bamboo forests, walking Unconsciously, I went to a place deep in the bamboo forest. There was a small open space, some familiar, vaguely remembered, as if it was the place where Zhang Xiaofan first came here and worked hard to cut bamboo.</p>
<p>Xiaohui stops, squats on the ground, grabs his head with his hand and looks around.</p>
<p>In the deep bamboo forest, there was silence.</p>
<p>But there seems to be some strange breath floating here.</p>
<p>Make your heart beat faster</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poof!&rdquo; A gentle step, step on the quiet in the deep bamboo forest.</p>
<p>Small ash and rhubarb turn their heads at the same time. That figure, behind a thick bamboo, slowly appears.</p>
<p>Suddenly there was silence again in the bamboo forest, but a moment later, there was a shout of cheering, and the little ash jumped up. The body turned into gray light and rushed to the past, jumped into the air and jumped into the arms of the man!</p>
<p>It tightly grasps the man&rsquo;s clothes, laughs loudly, and releases its joy with no scruples, &ldquo;squeak&rdquo; laughs continuously.</p>
<p>The man passed by, and the ferocity of the past was gone now. His eyebrows were full of soft smiles that had not been seen for a long time, and he held the ash in his arms. A moment later, I suddenly felt again. I looked down and saw a smile on the corner of my mouth. I leaned down and stroked the head of rhubarb that was rubbing his body. I smiled and said, &ldquo;rhubarb, are you ok?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rhubarb naturally can&rsquo;t speak, just whine in a low voice, wagging his tail and rubbing his head against the palm of his hand.</p>
<p>His corner of the eye, as if no one saw it, reflected the light: &ldquo;only you, or as before the general to me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sighed and breathed deeply. In this bamboo forest, he used to be familiar with the taste of missing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly, there was a rush of footsteps again, but the wild dog Taoist ran out from behind. However, seeing that he had been torn by thorns on his shabby Taoist robe, he knew that he had gone the wrong way.</p>
<p>The wild dog Taoist is full of misfortune and complains to Zhang Xiaofan, who used to be, and now the ghost: &ldquo;hello. Son of a bitch, are you crazy? You don&rsquo;t need to die like this! This is Qingyun gate, in case someone finds it. Even if we have ten lives, we will die! &quot;</p>
<p>All of a sudden, I turned back to the gentle rhubarb just now. The hair on my neck stood up and showed my teeth. Obviously, I didn&rsquo;t like the wild dog very much. A moment later. Rhubarb roared, unexpectedly rushed over.</p>
<p>The wild dog was startled, but seeing that there was almost half a man coming to the height of the huge dog, he felt a little bit at first, and subconsciously reached for his fangs.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, at the moment, ghost Li said lightly in front: &ldquo;if you dare to hurt this dog with magic weapon, I will cut off your hands and feet, and then throw them in front of Shoujing hall at the foot of the mountain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wild dog was shocked and said angrily, &ldquo;what do you say&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But before he finished speaking, the rhubarb had already arrived. The wild dog was knocked down by the giant dog when he lost his mind. At once, the barking and scolding of dogs were heard all the time. The people and dogs were writhing, staggering and shouting! The wild dog Taoist and rhubarb rolled to the back of a bramble in the distance. We couldn&rsquo;t see the figure of the dog, only heard the angry cry from time to time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! Dead dog, you still bite Hey, you bastard, you don&rsquo;t want this dog to let go. No, loose mouth, ah Dead dog, that&rsquo;s human leg. It&rsquo;s not drumsticks! Let go, don&rsquo;t bite Ah ah&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>GUI Li turned away from the howling of wild dogs in the distance and looked at the little ash in his arms. His eyebrows were smiling. After a careful examination, I saw that it had not been seen for ten years, and Xiaohui seemed to grow up a little. The feeling of holding in my arms seems to be much heavier than before. Even the trace between his eyes seems to be much bigger.</p>
<p>After the initial joy and excitement, Xiao Hui still grinned and climbed to his shoulder as usual, and reached out his hand to touch his hair.</p>
<p>Ghost Li stood quietly, then slowly walked out, walked to the edge of the bamboo forest, looked at the distance, the place in front of the mountain was covered by clouds and mist, used to be his warmest home.</p>
<p>He was stunned and looked deeply.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how long it took for Rhubarb to run out of the deep bamboo forest triumphantly, shaking his head and tail, jumping to the side of GUI Li and barking.</p>
<p>With a fierce smile, he reached out and patted him on the head.</p>
<p>After a while, the Taoist wild dog staggered out of the black bamboo forest, his robe was a bit worn, and even a dog&rsquo;s face was scratched a few more times. As for the wound at his feet, it was even faintly visible.</p>
<p>At the moment, seeing rhubarb lying by the side of the ghost, I was afraid, but I didn&rsquo;t dare to go there. I said angrily from afar, &ldquo;dead dog, don&rsquo;t think someone will support you, sooner or later I will kill you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rhubarb turned around and roared at the wild dog Taoist. The wild dog was so scared that he even stepped back a few steps. But rhubarb only frightened him. He didn&rsquo;t come after him for a moment, but turned around. The wild dog was relieved, but he didn&rsquo;t dare to scold any more.</p>
<p>Looking down at the mountain for a long time, the first ray of sunshine of the day has fallen quietly, covering the green mountain with a layer of light golden clothes.</p>
<p>Close your eyes and breathe deeply.</p>
<p>A moment later, he turned around, reached for the little ash on his shoulder, held it in his arms, looked at the wild dog, and said, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wild dog was eager to hear this, and hurried to come over, muttering: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s nothing to do! Risk your life for a monkey&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>Rhubarb seemed to feel something, stood up and looked at the ghost. Ghost Li reached out and patted rhubarb&rsquo;s head, smiled, and with a wave of his left hand, a black stick with a dark blue light appeared. It was the &ldquo;fire stick&rdquo; of that year, holding his body up to the sky.</p>
<p>The wild dog is dumb and complains: &ldquo;where do you think it is, son! It&rsquo;s so arrogant even to leave&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>He was complaining. All of a sudden, rhubarb roared loudly. The wild dog was scared. He quickly controlled the magic weapon and followed the ghost.</p>
<p>In front of the black bamboo forest, rhubarb was alone, barking loudly, all the time</p>
<p>Its wild roar echoed in the mountain, and kept shouting until a white hand touched its head. The soft voice said: &ldquo;rhubarb, what&rsquo;s the matter? How can I run here today and keep shouting? &quot;</p>
<p>Rhubarb seemed to be a little excited and panting. He looked at Tian ling&rsquo;er, who is now a young woman, and then turned around and barked at the sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wang Wang, Wang Wang, Wang Wang Wang&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian ling&rsquo;er frowned, looked around, and said, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter. chinese rhubarb? By the way, where&rsquo;s Xiaohui? Why isn&rsquo;t it with you? &quot;</p>
<p>Rhubarb didn&rsquo;t know if he understood what she said, but he still barked at the sky.</p>
<p>Tian ling&rsquo;er looks at the sky. But only see blue sky and white clouds, blue sky infinite, vaguely a cloud from the clouds, gallop the sky, it is spectacular. Somehow. Her heart suddenly a confused, for a while was looking at the idiot.</p>
<p>To the south of Qingyun Mountain, thousands of miles away in a remote place, there is a high mountain called &ldquo;Huqi mountain&rdquo;, which is the main hall of the ghost King sect.</p>
<p>In the past ten years, the power of the evil cult has been increasingly prosperous, and experts have been fighting, but the internal fighting has become increasingly fierce, which is even more fierce than fighting with the right way. The ghost King clan is one of the four sects in the demon sect. In the past ten years, the leader of the sect, the ghost king, has made great efforts to govern the sect. He has made the ghost King&rsquo;s sect grow stronger and stronger, and has gradually replaced the ten thousand poisons sect as the largest sect of the demon sect.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s ghost King clan, in addition to the mysterious four holy emissaries, there is a mysterious figure &ldquo;Mr. ghost&rdquo; around the ghost king, who only listens to people&rsquo;s voices and doesn&rsquo;t see people. However, it is the younger generation of the ghost King clan that attracts the most attention, especially the ghost Li who is highly valued by the ghost king. The king of ghosts even made an exception to the rule and took him as the vice patriarch. Now it is well known that Gui Li must be the leader of the next generation.</p>
<p>In the demon sect, internal fighting is not only fierce, but also extreme. I don&rsquo;t know how many people have tried to separate the relationship between the ghost king and his No. 1 general, but all failed.</p>
<p>However, in the hearts of the few who know the past, there is a touch of sadness for the two people&rsquo;s strong and almost unbreakable relationship.</p>
<p>The black veil gently covers her face. You Ji, a mysterious woman in black, is sitting silently in the most important room of the ghost king. The room is not very big. But it&rsquo;s very cold. The reason is that there is a crystal clear white ice platform in the center of the room. It&rsquo;s so cold that it floats from the almost transparent ice platform.</p>
<p>A beautiful woman, dressed in her beloved green clothes, lies quietly on the top. In the white cold air, her face looks pale, as if it is transparent, with cold beauty!</p>
<p>She put her hands in front of her, palms, as if connected with her body, is a small golden bell, shining with strange light, as if staring at the world.</p>
<p>At this time, there was a low &ldquo;rumble&rdquo; behind me. The heavy stone door of this room was pushed open and then closed.</p>
<p>Footsteps began to sound, and someone came to Youji&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>You Ji slowly looks up, can enter this room, even if it is all ghost King clan, also won&rsquo;t exceed four people.</p>
<p>Some pale faces of the ghost and fierce face floated in front of her eyes. She slightly throbbed in her heart behind the black veil, vaguely remembering that every time the man entered here, his face became more and more pale.</p>
<p>But in the eyes of the man, there is no Youji at all. The beautiful woman lying there peacefully, now, has occupied his whole body and mind.</p>
<p>The stone room suddenly became very quiet, like death.</p>
<p>Youji gently gets up and retreats, but her eyes are still on the man.</p>
<p>His figure seems to be lonely again. As for the terrible bloody breath that often appears on him in the outside world, I can&rsquo;t feel it here at all.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s only here that he can get peace.</p>
<p>At last, she looked at the man, went out, closed the stone gate carefully, and then she was stunned. A green dragon in white stood beside her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; You Ji is silent for a moment, light tunnel.</p>
<p>Qinglong looked at the stone gate and said, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Youji&rsquo;s black gauze moved, as if nodding slightly, and said, &ldquo;yes, I&rsquo;m talking with Biyao in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Qinglong frowned and sighed. In fact, they all know that the so-called speech is just a whisper by Gui Li alone. As for whether Bi Yao can hear it, it&rsquo;s another matter. It&rsquo;s just that they are too sad to talk about it.</p>
<p>You Ji stood silently for a while, and suddenly said, &ldquo;Zhang Xiaofan will come here at the first time every time he comes back&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Qinglong&rsquo;s face changed slightly, and he cut off: &ldquo;Sanmei, he has been given the name of zuobili by the Lord of the ghost king. I told you many times, don&rsquo;t call him by that name again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After Youji&rsquo;s black veil, she didn&rsquo;t know what expression it was, but she didn&rsquo;t change her tone at all. She continued: &quot; But the patriarch has not come here for a long time. &quot;</p>
<p>Qinglong looked at her, and finally sighed and said: &ldquo;in the past ten years, the white hair on the sideburns of the master&rsquo;s hair has increased. Can you see it anyway? He didn&rsquo;t want the only daughter, he just kept the pain in his heart. &quot;</p>
<p>Youji is silent again. Then she looks up as if she thinks of something. She says, &ldquo;how is the matter of looking for the black witch family going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Qinglong shook his head and said, &ldquo;the black witch family was only a flash in the pan a thousand years ago, but now it has no clue where to find it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You Ji slowly turns around and walks out.</p>
<p>The stone room where Biyao fell asleep is naturally in the very secluded place of the ghost King clan. There are few people in ordinary times. At this moment, there are only two of them in the corridor outside the stone room.</p>
<p>Looking at the back of Youji, Qinglong suddenly said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;d better stay away from the ghost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You Ji&rsquo;s body suddenly vibrated and stopped at once. The whole person seemed to straighten up, but then slowly relaxed. She turned around and stared at the green dragon through the black yarn, saying, &ldquo;what do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Qinglong stopped looking at her, looked at the stone door of the stone chamber, and said lightly, &ldquo;I know that you feel guilty for Biyao and think you didn&rsquo;t protect her, but you have already paid some private attention to that man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You Ji stopped talking, but the corridor suddenly became almost colder than the stone chamber just now, and the invisible meaning of killing seemed to emanate from the woman in black.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean that I have feelings for this young man?&rdquo; She spewed out word by word.</p>
<p>Qinglong didn&rsquo;t feel the killing intention in front of him, and his face didn&rsquo;t change. He just said slowly: &ldquo;three younger sister, I didn&rsquo;t say that. I just want to remind you that the relationship between the prince of the ghost and this man has always been very delicate because of Biyao. I have been following the leader of the ghost king for many years, and I know that although he regards the ghost as his own, sometimes he is sad and Bi Yao is so sad. I&rsquo;m afraid that he also has some hatred. &quot;</p>
<p>Speaking of this, he turned around and looked at Youji deeply. He said softly, &ldquo;three younger sisters, you should do yourself well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the distance, Youji snorted coldly and said coldly, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to say!&rdquo; After that, he turned around and walked away.</p>
<p>Qinglong smiled bitterly, shook his head and sighed.</p>
<p>In the stone chamber.</p>
<p>Ghost Li sat beside Baguio, staring at the beautiful face with a little pale, and said softly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m back, Baguio.&rdquo;</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>&ldquo;This time, I went out and killed a sect for your father. It&rsquo;s the blood refining hall we knew. Do you remember?&rdquo;</p>
