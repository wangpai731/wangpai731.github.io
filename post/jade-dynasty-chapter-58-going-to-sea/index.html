      <p>The night is deep, the wind and rain blows between the heaven and the earth. I don&rsquo;t know where the fallen leaves come from. They flutter gently in the wind and rain, passing by with the wind.</p>
<p>Under the turquoise oilcloth umbrella, her clothes flicked gently, with several strands of black hair sticking to her snow-white cheek.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan stood in the same place, but in such a moment, his mind was lost. In this strange place in the middle of the night, but there seems to be familiar with the wind and rain</p>
<p>He slowly, walked past, walked into the wind and rain.</p>
<p>Behind him, in the dark, there are deep eyes, silently watching.</p>
<p>The whole world seems to be quiet when we are near.</p>
<p>Her eyes are right ahead.</p>
<p>So gentle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why haven&rsquo;t you gone to sleep?&rdquo; Zhang Xiaofan slowly tunnel.</p>
<p>Biyao didn&rsquo;t answer, just looked at him, eyes like water, reflecting his shadow.</p>
<p>The rain gradually wetted his clothes. From his hair, it slowly condensed into small and crystal water drops, flowing through his black hair, dropping gently, and sliding down his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you?&rdquo; &ldquo;Why haven&rsquo;t you slept?&rdquo; she asked</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was silent for a while and said, &ldquo;stone snores in his sleep. It&rsquo;s too loud. I can&rsquo;t sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biyao Zheng for a while, and then &ldquo;poof Chi&rdquo; a, chuckle out, eyes flow, that faint around her light, as if also suddenly lit up.</p>
<p>In Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s eyes, she is like a lily blooming gently in the rain at night.</p>
<p>She smiled, reached out her hand, took Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s hand, and Zhang Xiaofan took a step forward involuntarily. In the wind and rain, the little green umbrella came across and stood over his head.</p>
<p>Under the umbrella, it was her breathing.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s heart suddenly began to beat fast, so he looked away from her, not to see her, but the faint fragrance seemed to emanate from her body. But around him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow, are you going to Liubo mountain?&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a quiet tunnel.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s heart moved and said, &ldquo;yes!&rdquo; He looked up at her and said, &ldquo;what about you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Baguio smiled faintly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s face changed, he frowned and said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t be a kid. There are so many decent people there. My master&rsquo;s temper is even worse. You will be in danger if you go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biyao stopped talking. Just stare at him in silence.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan felt uneasy in his heart, but he couldn&rsquo;t say anything, but he thought it was always bad to stand in the rain with her so late at night. He said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go back first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biyao didn&rsquo;t answer. Zhang Xiaofan left her side and walked back.</p>
<p>But in the middle of his walk, behind him, in the rain, suddenly came her voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Xiaofan!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was stunned. This is the first time that Biyao calls him so affectionately.</p>
<p>He slowly turned around, wind and rain across them, as if larger, so the face of Baguio, also seems to be a little fuzzy, but her voice, it is so clear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just now, when I was standing here alone, I thought to myself, in fact, if we two died in the blood hole, we could not escape. That&rsquo;s good, too. &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s body shook, then he forced a smile and said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t make fun of it.&rdquo; With that, he walked away quickly.</p>
<p>Baguio looked at his figure. Slowly bowed his head, gently with only his own voice, said: &ldquo;at least, I will not regret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan went to the corridor and left the wind and rain, feeling relieved. I don&rsquo;t know how. He always felt the unknown tension in the face of the beautiful woman of the demon sect. Maybe this was the pressure brought by her identity!</p>
<p>He sighed secretly, but he couldn&rsquo;t help looking back. In the wind and rain, the woman still stood, shook her head, and walked back to her room.</p>
<p>Not long after he left, Baguio, holding a green umbrella, also came up and stood on the corridor, looking at the direction he was going, silent and speechless.</p>
<p>At this time, in the darkness behind her, suddenly the darkness moved for a while, but out of a whole body of black clothes, that is, a woman also covered with black veil came to her side.</p>
<p>Turning her head, she said lightly, &ldquo;aunt you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman in black took a look at Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s direction, and her voice was calm without feeling: &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go! Your father is waiting for you in Liubo mountain! &quot;</p>
<p>Baguio nodded slowly.</p>
<p>Early in the morning, Zhang Xiaofan, who was not easy to fall asleep, was awakened by the stone loudly: &ldquo;brother Zhang, get up quickly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan painstakingly opened his eyes and saw that the stone was full of energy and energy. Obviously, he slept very well last night!</p>
<p>He smiled bitterly and said nothing. He got up and went to wash his face in the basin beside him with his eyes blurred.</p>
<p>Stone sat on his bed and said with a smile, &ldquo;brother Zhang, I didn&rsquo;t say you. You are so young and a man of cultivation. You should be refreshed when you wake up all night. How do you look like you haven&rsquo;t slept all night! &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan read a sentence in his heart: &ldquo;who can sleep with you?&rdquo; But I can only smile and nod.</p>
<p>After the two of them finished washing, stone took Zhang Xiaofan to call Biyao to start together. Zhang Xiaofan frowned secretly, but in his heart he didn&rsquo;t want to, but he didn&rsquo;t speak clearly to stone. Unexpectedly, they knocked at the door for a long time, but no one answered. When they asked the shopkeeper again, it was Biyao who checked out late last night. By the way, they calculated the accommodation expenses of the two of them.</p>
<p>Stone Zheng for a while, shaking his head feel strange. Zhang Xiaofan stood aside and thought about the time that manager Wang said. She left soon after she broke up with Biyao.</p>
<p>In fact, Zhang Xiaofan has been worried about Biyao if she wants to go to Liubo mountain with him, what should she do.</p>
<p>The stone standing nearby just came to discuss with Zhang Xiaofan. Unexpectedly, manager Wang looked at him a few more eyes at the moment, and suddenly said, &ldquo;I dare to ask you, your name is stone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stone a Zheng, way: &ldquo;exactly, how do you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wang Zhang took out a letter from the bottom of the counter, saying, &ldquo;this is a guest who sent it to me this morning. He said it was for a tall young man named stone. That must be my guest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stone took a look at the letter, and the envelope was indeed written with his name, so he opened it to see. Zhang Xiaofan also looked back at it. Stone looked at it, frowned, lost his voice and said, &ldquo;master!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was surprised. &ldquo;What happened to your master?&rdquo; he said</p>
<p>Stone shook his head and said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, but this letter was written by my master. He asked me to go to Tudi temple in the west of the city to see him immediately. Brother Zhang, I think we are going to be separated for the time being. &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan nodded. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter, then you go. I&rsquo;m in a hurry to see my Shifu and them in Liubo mountain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stone said with a smile, &ldquo;when I see Shifu, I will tell him that most of his family will go to Liubo mountain. We&rsquo;ll see you then. &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan spent a lot of time with him, and he was a little close to him. He said with a smile, &ldquo;OK!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stone nodded and turned away.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan sent him to the door of the inn, watched his tall body disappear in the crowd, stood in situ for a while, then turned around and left alone to the East.</p>
<p>In the hall of Haiyun tower, where they are all far away, on Monday, Xian and his granddaughter Xiaohuan come out slowly.</p>
<p>Xiaohuan whispered, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s dangerous. I almost met my friend. &quot; Said horizontal Monday fairy one eye, way: &ldquo;not all is Grandpa you, go to where, one carelessly will meet some people who have been cheated by you, want to come to the world the most unjust, probably is me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Monday, Xianbai takes a look at Xiaohuan and ignores her. At this time, shopkeeper Wang saw the old fairy coming out. Naturally, he had already welcomed him. He served tea and vegetables with hospitality. You are welcome on Monday. I sat down with Xiaohuan Dala and chatted with shopkeeper Wang.</p>
<p>Shopkeeper Wang said: &ldquo;old fairy, do you know? Last night we heard something important outside Changhe city? &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; said the immortal on Monday</p>
<p>Shopkeeper Wang said: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. But it&rsquo;s said that it&rsquo;s the people who gather here these days. Last night, they met the people of the demon sect at the west end of the city. The fighting between the two sides was fierce. Listen to the people on the west side of the city, &ldquo;even the walls are shaking!&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Monday, the immortal was surprised and said, &ldquo;have the devil cult and the righteous fought?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shopkeeper Wang shrugged his shoulders and said: &ldquo;the news came in the morning. But most of the time there won&rsquo;t be any fake! &quot; He said that he was concerned about the tunnel: &ldquo;the old immortal, the righteous are all the people who cultivate the truth. I heard that the devil cult would not come to our common people&rsquo;s misfortune in general. But you have a profound way of life. If someone asks you to punish the demon cult, you must be careful! &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poof&rdquo;, the little ring beside is drinking a sip of tea, and can&rsquo;t help bursting out.</p>
<p>On Monday, Xian stared at Xiaohuan. Xiaohuan couldn&rsquo;t help laughing. Seeing Wang Zhang&rsquo;s chest looking at the color of Huai, she had to work hard to keep her normal mouth: &ldquo;ah! Shopkeeper Wang, don&rsquo;t worry about me and me. Yes, ha ha, it&rsquo;s from drinking water, ha ha, it&rsquo;s from choking&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>Liubo mountain in the East China Sea, seven thousand miles into the sea, is the extreme east of the world, and farther away is the boundless sea.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very remote here. It&rsquo;s natural that there are no people here. Unexpectedly, just a few days after Zhang Xiaofan and others entered kongsang mountain, the demons suddenly emerged from all over the country. In a few days, dozens of mending schools were destroyed by the demons, and the whole world was shocked. After eight hundred years, the evil cult rose again and gained great momentum.</p>
<p>In the right way, all the major sects, led by Qingyun gate, Tianyin temple and burning incense Valley, discussed in a hurry.</p>
<p>At this time, the news suddenly came from the burning incense valley that a large number of people from the demon sect would gather in the remote place of Liubo mountain in the East China Sea. Why?</p>
<p>The so-called moral leadership is irreconcilable. People in the right way are filled with indignation. In a few days, they were mainly from the three sects. They sent their elite disciples to Liubo mountain in the East China Sea under the guidance of the elders with profound cultivation. Along the way, many decent people joined in, intending to clean up the demons and benefit the world.</p>
<p>Along the way, Zhang Xiaofan was interested in inquiring about how much he knew what had happened. His heart was filled with blood, and he was determined to go to the East China Sea.</p>
<p>But the way to the East is very far. The demon sect chose this place, but I was afraid that even though the central plains were rich, they were also deeply rooted in the three sects. It&rsquo;s just that the righteous road is not prosperous now, and in the hearts of all righteous people, the words of righteousness are at the top of their heads, and those who are far away still rush to destroy it!</p>
<p>On the way, Zhang Xiaofan was in a hurry. Except for rest, he was flying in the sky with a fire stick. More than two days later, out of the sea, you can often see some small islands at the beginning. Another ten days later, when you fly far away, you can only see the blue sea and blue sky, the sky is high and the clouds are light.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s often flying day and night. The sea is clear and blue. If it&rsquo;s not for the waves, it&rsquo;s almost like a crystal clear and beautiful gem under his feet, but there&rsquo;s no shadow of the island.</p>
<p>At this time, Zhang Xiaofan is in the middle of the air. The sea breeze came, cool on his face, but he was worried.</p>
<p>Today, he has been flying out of the East China Sea for ten days. This time, he did not find an island to rest for one day or two nights. Unexpectedly, I lost my way in the boundless sea.</p>
<p>But these days, he&rsquo;s been sleeping and eating, and nothing else. He&rsquo;s very good at flying in the sky. He&rsquo;s not as frightened as before.</p>
<p>At the moment, he looked up at the sky, and looked down at the blue sea under his feet. He could not help but smile bitterly.</p>
<p>Just before he thought about it, Zhang Xiaofan suddenly heard a clear birdsong, which sounded in front of him. He looked up, but it was a white seagull, flying over the sea.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s heart moved. At the beginning of the sea, he saw many of these seabirds, but when they flew far away, they could not reach them, and they could not see them any more. Unexpectedly, there are seabirds in the deep sea. It seems that there must be islands nearby.</p>
<p>Think about it. Zhang Xiaofan was excited and did not hesitate to fly towards the seagull. Boundless sea, boundless. In the distant horizon, the sky and the sea are the same, poetic and picturesque.</p>
<p>Flying between the heaven and the earth, suddenly there is a sense of coming out of the world, relaxed and happy, as if the whole person and the heaven and earth into one.</p>
<p>I watched it fly for half an hour. As expected, I saw an island in front of me. Seen from the sky, the whole island is lush and covered with vegetation, and the surrounding water near the island is clear and blue, like crystal clear sapphire.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan has been flying for a long time, and he is a little tired. Now, he falls down with a fire stick and takes a rest on the island. As soon as he stepped on the ground, Zhang Xiaofan looked around and saw that the scenery was different from that in the sky.</p>
<p>The clear sea water washes the white sand beach one by one. In the coastal area, there is a kind of tree which is not found in the middle soil. Its trunk is high, but there is no side branch. It is directly inserted into the sky. Only at the top of the tree is a large number of branches and leaves. Under the branches and leaves are bearing fruit as big as a child&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>Further down the island, in addition to the tall trees, the low shrubs are also gradually thriving. The woods are thick, but there is no road. It seems that no one has been here for thousands of years.</p>
<p>Overhead, the seagulls are singing and circling over the island, and the fresh sea breeze is blowing from the sea level, which is very cool. Zhang Xiaofan took a deep breath. In this desolate place, a sense of tiredness came up. He looked left and right. There was nothing strange. He found a clean place, lay down with his clothes, and soon fell asleep.</p>
<p>This sleep is quite fragrant. The island is quiet. Apart from the tide and sea breeze, there is no change. Naturally, no one will disturb it. Zhang Xiaofan sleeps until dusk, and then wakes up.</p>
<p>Stretch a stretch, stand up, Zhang Xiaofan walked to the beach, looked up, and saw that the sea view at dusk was very different from that at daytime. The setting sun is like blood. On the west coast of the skyline, there is a piece of cloud and sea. The clouds and the clouds are steaming, with different shapes and boundless illusions. The sea breeze blows from the sea, Zhang Xiaofan can&rsquo;t help but open his arms and breathe deeply.</p>
<p>A kind of comfortable feeling filled his body. In this place like a paradise, it seemed that the whole person was relaxed.</p>
<p>At that moment, he couldn&rsquo;t help thinking that if he could live in this clean place, he would spend his life with elder martial sister ling&rsquo;er every day and watching the beautiful sunset.</p>
<p>At the thought of Tian ling&rsquo;er, Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s heart is hot again. It has been more than a month since he went down the mountain. Since he entered Qingyun gate, he has never been separated from elder martial sister for such a long time. Now in this silent Island, he thinks that elder martial sister may be on another nearby island. Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s heart immediately stirs up and can&rsquo;t be calm any more.</p>
<p>Standing for a long time, the ups and downs of the mood slowly calmed down, only to hear &ldquo;Goo Goo&rdquo; twice, but hungry. Zhang Xiaofan smiled bitterly. Since he was trapped in the blood cave of kongsang mountain, he seemed to be very hungry. But fortunately, he has enough dry food, but there is not much water left.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan looked around, and finally his eyes fell on the fruits of the tall trees, and he picked several of them.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the shell was extremely hard. At last, Zhang Xiaofan smashed it ten times below the stone to break it open, but the juice from it was white. Zhang Xiaofan was so happy that he drank up a fruit at a draught. He thought that although it tasted astringent, it tasted sweet and was a rare good product.</p>
<p>With this natural delicacy, Zhang Xiaofan contented himself with a meal. Seeing that it was dark, he thought of going on his way tomorrow.</p>
<p>At this time, it was getting late, and the sea wind was blowing on me, and it was getting colder. Zhang Xiaofan frowned and walked to the forest, but hesitated for a moment, but finally he didn&rsquo;t go in. He just found a shelter around here and lay down.</p>
<p>The night is getting thicker, and the bright moon rises from the East, full of stars. It seems like a naughty child, jumping out one by one, blinking in the night sky.</p>
<p>After sleeping for most of the afternoon, Zhang Xiaofan was unable to fall asleep at this time. He could not help thinking about what thousands of people said to him at the ancient tea stand that day.</p>
<p>He picked up the fire stick inserted in his waist, reflecting the faint light of the stars in the sky. He saw that the originally black fire stick gave off a faint blue light, especially the red blood in it, which seemed to have life at the moment, as if there were fresh blood flowing in it.</p>
<p>These are the words of all men, my blood essence?</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan read a low sentence in his heart and felt mixed feelings for a while.</p>
<p>He clearly remembered the scene in the valley that day. The blood bead sucked a lot of blood from his palm</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s body shook for a while and shook his head, unwilling to think about the past.</p>
<p>However, this magic weapon is still so clear in front of him, and even the unique cold feeling is still so familiar in his body, just like a part of his body.</p>
<p>On that day, although he spoke to tens of thousands of people in a dignified way, when he arrived at his own place, he was still not so well received.</p>
<p>After all, it&rsquo;s not easy for him, a little disciple who grew up in a famous sect, to suddenly accept that his magic weapon is a demon sect evil thing.</p>
<p>Thinking of this, he couldn&rsquo;t help but look at the past of the firecracker again. Looking at the clearer blood in it at the moment, he couldn&rsquo;t help thinking: how many ghosts have been killed by this magic weapon?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m afraid that there are many people&rsquo;s spirits in the blood!</p>
<p>He couldn&rsquo;t help shivering.</p>
