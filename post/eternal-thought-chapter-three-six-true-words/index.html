      <p>Chapter three</p>
<p>When Bai Xiaochun stretched out her head like this, the young man with yellow complexion and thin immediately saw her, and her eyes fell on her face, and she was furious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You took my place!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not me!&rdquo; It&rsquo;s too late for Bai Xiaochun to shrink her head and pretend to be innocent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, you are so thin and your head is so small, you are definitely NEW!&rdquo; Xu Baocai clenched his fist and glared at Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It really has nothing to do with me.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun looks at the other party&rsquo;s anger as if to explode the same, feel aggrieved, whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care. Three days later, on the south slope of zongmen, you and I will fight to the death. If you win, you may bear the tone. If you lose, the quota will be mine.&rdquo; Xu Baocai opened his mouth in a loud voice, threw a blood letter from his arms, and threw it directly on the windowsill in front of Bai Xiaochun, on which countless bloody killing words were written.</p>
<p>When Bai Xiaochun looked at the blood letter and the many bloody killing words on it, she only felt that she was so murderous that she felt very angry. Especially when she heard that the other side said that she would fight to the death, she took a breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elder martial brother, what a big thing! I wrote so many words with my own blood What a pain. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a big deal? Ah, I have been frugal these years and saved seven years of spirit stone. Seven years, seven years!! Filial piety to the deacon, this only exchange a qualification to enter the fire stove room, but you put in a foot, I and you are irreconcilable, three days later, either you die or I live! &quot; Xu Baocai was hysterical and gnashing his teeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun quickly picked up the blood book with her fingertips and threw it out of the window sill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You Xu Baocai was just about to lose his temper. He felt the ground tremble, and there was a mountain of meat beside him. I don&rsquo;t know when, Zhang daphou was standing there, looking at Xu Baocai coldly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jiupang, go and wash the dishes with your second senior brother. As for you, don&rsquo;t yell and play here.&rdquo; With a wave of his hand, Zhang Da Pang set off waves of wind.</p>
<p>Xu Baocai&rsquo;s face changed. He stepped back a few steps. He wanted to say something, but after seeing Zhang Da Pang, he held back. Finally, he looked at Xiaochun with resentment, and then he left bitterly.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun thought about it for a while, and felt that the other side&rsquo;s eyes were too insidious when he left. For the sake of safety, he decided that he or she should not go out of the kitchen at will. If he stayed here, the other party should not dare to come in.</p>
<p>After a few days, Bai Xiaochun gradually adapted to the work of the fire stove. At night, he practiced the skill of controlling the tripod with purple Qi. Unfortunately, the progress was slow, and he could not persist in more than four breaths, which made Bai Xiaochun very distressed.</p>
<p>This night, while he was practicing, he suddenly heard the excited voices of the fat brothers in the fire kitchen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s closed. It&rsquo;s closed. Huang Er Pang, close the door quickly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Black three fat, go to see if there are peeking around!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun was stunned. This time, he learned to be smart. Instead of looking through the window, he saw a few fat people outside. They were extremely flexible and were walking fast in the yard, mysterious and busy.</p>
<p>Soon, the door of the fireplace was closed tightly, and there was a thin mist around him, which made the figure of those fat men more mysterious.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun watched for a long time until he saw that the fat men were not running around, but were mysteriously surrounded in front of a thatched cottage. Even through the fog, he could see Zhang Da Pang&rsquo;s powerful figure. He seemed to be saying something in a low voice. He felt that it was better for him to know something secret, so he stepped back and tried to make a gesture that he did not see.</p>
<p>But just then, Zhang&rsquo;s voice came.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jiupang, you have seen it. Come here quickly.&rdquo; The sound is not big, as if deliberately pressed down.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun blinked, her face showed a clever look, a pair of harmless people and animals, went out.</p>
<p>As soon as he got close to him, Zhang Dazhou took Bai Xiaochun to his side. Bai Xiaochun, who was surrounded by several fat people around him, immediately smelled a distinctive smell. He inhaled it into his nostrils and turned into countless warm currents, which integrated into his whole body.</p>
<p>When we look at others, they all look comfortable. Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s spirit shakes. He sees a piece of Ganoderma lucidum the size of a baby&rsquo;s head in Zhang&rsquo;s hand. The glossy ganoderma lucidum is crystal clear, and it is not a common product.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nine younger martial brother, come on, have a bite.&rdquo; Zhang daphou looks at Bai Xiaochun and hands over the Ganoderma lucidum in his hand. He says in a simple voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah?&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun looks at Ganoderma lucidum, and then looks at several fat elder martial brothers. Seeing Bai Xiaochun hesitates, Zhang daphou is angry. If you don&rsquo;t eat, we will not finish.</p>
<p>Not only is he so, all around Huang Er Pang, Hei San Pang and others are like this, staring at Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun swallows his saliva. This kind of Ganoderma lucidum, which is so valuable, precious and extraordinary, is given to him as chicken leg. He has to force himself to eat it. If he doesn&rsquo;t eat it, he will turn over his face. He has encountered it in his dream, and it is the first time in reality.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s heart was pounding. As soon as he bit his teeth, he took the Ganoderma lucidum and took a big bite. The Ganoderma lucidum meat melted in the mouth. After being integrated into the whole body, he felt a lot more comfortable than before, which made her face red.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, after eating the one hundred year old Ganoderma lucidum that elder sun ordered to use in the soup, we will really be our own people.&rdquo; Zhang daphou looked satisfied. He ate a small piece and threw it to the next fat man. Soon, everyone ate the Ganoderma lucidum around. When he looked at Bai Xiaochun, he also showed his own smile.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun laughs and suddenly understands that this is collusion. It&rsquo;s OK for these elder martial brothers to eat so fat. It&rsquo;s safe to eat this way. No wonder that Xu Baocai wants to write so many killing words for himself</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elder martial brother, the Ganoderma lucidum is so delicious that I feel hot all over.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun licked his lips and looked at Zhang daphou eagerly.</p>
<p>Hearing this, Zhang daphou&rsquo;s eyes lit up and laughed. He took out a piece of Polygonatum from his arms and handed it to Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Younger martial brother, now you know here, elder martial brother didn&rsquo;t cheat you before. Eat, and then you will be satisfied!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s eyes flashed and took a big bite. Just after eating, Zhang daphou took out another piece of treasure. The treasure was golden and fragrant.</p>
<p>This time, without Zhang daphou&rsquo;s words, Bai Xiaochun quickly bit it down. When she was full of sour and sweet, she took out a red fruit, which had a sweet and greasy smell, and a trace of air was spinning inside.</p>
<p>So in the following time, all kinds of Ganoderma lucidum, medicinal materials, lingguo, Dibao and Bai Xiaochun all took a bite, and so did several other fat people. Until Bai Xiaochun was dizzy and drunk, his whole body swelled with heat, and even white smoke came out from his head. He felt that his body had gained weight.</p>
<p>As he continued to eat, Zhang&rsquo;s eyes became softer and softer. At the end of the day, they clapped their stomachs and laughed, with a sense of collusion.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun was drunk and dizzy. She let go of her hands and feet. She slapped Zhang daphou&rsquo;s stomach with one foot beside her. She laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The other rooms of the office of the factotum have broken the head in order to get a place for an outside disciple. But we, in order to lose the place of an outside disciple, have all broken the head. No one wants to go. It&rsquo;s good to be an outside disciple here.&rdquo; The more he looked at Bai Xiaochun, the more he felt about his temper. He said triumphantly, and took out a ginseng. The man had countless knots on his head, and the number of whiskers was even more dense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ninth younger martial brother, each of us has long been good enough to become a foreign disciple, but we have to hide it. You see, this is a hundred year old ginseng. In order to have a bite, the outer disciples have broken their heads. Look at us.&rdquo; Zhang daphou directly broke off a whisker and threw it in his mouth. After crunching down, he handed the ginseng to Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elder martial brother, I&rsquo;m full I really can&rsquo;t eat this time&hellip; &quot; Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s eyes are blurred. He is really holding on. When he is opening his mouth, Zhang daphou pulls out a whisker and puts it directly into his mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Younger martial brother, you are too thin. If you go out like this, which girl in the clan will like it? What we like is elder martial brother. We are so powerful and full. Come on, eat We have antithetical couplets in huozaofang, which is called &ldquo;better starve to death in the fire stove than fight with the outside door.&rdquo; Zhang dabong belched, took out a pile of empty bowls, and pointed to the thatched cottage beside him, where there was a pair of couplets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, we all starve here, eh They all starved to death. &quot; Looking at this couplet, Bai Xiaochun patted her stomach and belched.</p>
<p>Zhang daphou and others laughed at the speech and thought that Bai Xiaochun was more and more cute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m happy today. Ninth junior brother, I tell you a piece of knowledge. We have to pay attention to the food in the fire stove. There is a pithy formula. You should remember that Lingzhu eats the side corner, the main pole can&rsquo;t be touched, the meat is cut with a knife, the bone is removed and left three points. The spirit porridge is mixed with water, and the small half cup of Qiongjiang is made.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These six truths are summed up by the martyrs for many years. As long as you eat according to this, you can make sure that there is no accident. All right, let&rsquo;s go. Today&rsquo;s snack is over, and those outside disciples are still waiting for soup.&rdquo; As he spoke, Zhang poured rice soup into bowls.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun was in a daze, full of the six true words. He looked at Zhang daphou and others who were pouring rice soup. After a hiccup, he squatted down and picked up an empty bowl. After a careful look, he grinned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elder martial brother, this bowl is not very good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After hearing this, Zhang daphou and others look at Bai Xiaochun with a surprised look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at this bowl. It doesn&rsquo;t look big, but it can hold a lot of it. Why don&rsquo;t we make it look big, but actually it has very little? For example, the bottom of this bowl Thicker? &quot; White Xiaochun a pair of clever appearance, smile of say.</p>
<p>Zhang daphou was stunned. He felt as if he had been bombarded by thunder. His fat body was shaking slowly, his eyes were shining. The other fat people were also shorting of breath, and their whole body fat was shaking.</p>
<p>With a bang, Zhang daphun slapped his thigh and burst into laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;OK, OK, OK, this is a good idea that can be famous forever and benefit countless descendants of my fire kitchen. I didn&rsquo;t expect that you look so clever and have such goods in your stomach, ha ha, you are born to be the material of fire kitchen!&rdquo;</p>
