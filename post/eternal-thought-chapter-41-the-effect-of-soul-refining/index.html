      <p>There are no mice in Xiangyun mountain. The rats can&rsquo;t exist unless they are spirit animals. However, there are many ants in the mountains.</p>
<p>These ants are natural things, usually in the cracks of some rocks, they will not be boring, as if they are part of the mountain, so no one cares.</p>
<p>But today, around the alchemy Pavilion, the disciple who was guarding there suddenly stood up. In an instant, he found that countless ants appeared on the ground. These ants went straight to the medicine refining Pavilion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This What&rsquo;s going on here? &quot; The disciple who was guarding the medicine refining Pavilion took a breath and looked at the countless ants and felt his scalp numb.</p>
<p>At the same time, in many rooms of the medicine refining Pavilion, many disciples who were refining pills all cried out. There was a roar of explosion of pills, and more ants were roaring. Even if there were arrays, the alchemy rooms were originally in the mountain, and those ants were drilling out along the gaps.</p>
<p>Go straight in one direction.</p>
<p>This direction is Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s room. At the moment, he picked up the black pill curiously. When he looked surprised, he heard the roar coming from the outside. At the same time, countless ants suddenly appeared on the floor of his room.</p>
<p>These ants are crazy and go straight to Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Xiangyun mountain is still plagued with ants!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun jumps up suddenly, feeling goose bumps all over his body. But as he jumps up, some ants actually jump up and go straight to the black pill in Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s hands.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s scalp was numb. Seeing this scene, regardless of whether it was useful or not, he quickly threw out the pills in his hands. Almost at the moment when the pills were thrown out, the ants changed their direction and rushed to the pills.</p>
<p>When the pill fell to the ground, in the blink of an eye, countless ants surrounded it, and soon formed a big ball. This scene showed that Bai Xiaochun had a pale and frightening look.</p>
<p>Soon, the big ball made up of ants fell down like a collapse. Countless ants got into the gap and disappeared. As for the pill, there was no more left.</p>
<p>There was no ant in the whole medicine refining Pavilion for a moment. They came quickly and disappeared quickly. Although it made the alchemy disciples depressed, there was no way to protect them. Although they were curious, they didn&rsquo;t report it.</p>
<p>After all, only Bai Xiaochun saw the craziness of those ants. In other people&rsquo;s eyes, only a large number of ants passed by.</p>
<p>Bai xiaochunxin has a lingering fear. It seems that there is no problem when she raises the pill she has just refined. She is just too careful. In terms of refining techniques, even if she succeeds, she has to keep improving. Vaguely, she seems to have adjusted the proportion of matching for the last refining and tonifying elixir.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it that the tonic elixir I finally refined is also a great tonic for ants?&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun scratched his head and felt that he seemed to be very powerful. He could not only refine the pills that people eat, but also the pills of ants.</p>
<p>When she walked out of the room, listening to the gloomy voices of those alchemy disciples coming out of other rooms around, Bai Xiaochun felt a little embarrassed, so she bowed her head and left quickly.</p>
<p>A few days later, Bai Xiaochun saw that there was no wind coming from the medicine refining Pavilion. After paying the contribution, he chose another room to continue refining medicine.</p>
<p>This time, he began to refine longevity incense.</p>
<p>Although refining incense and alchemy are similar, there are also some differences in techniques. After all, one is to eat, the other is to ignite and inhale. Especially when the final medicine is made, one is Dan, and the other is a piece of incense condensed together.</p>
<p>With the last experience, Bai Xiaochun kept cautious and careful when refining this longevity incense. Finally, it took two months, ten ingredients, and seven pieces were successful.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun left in his wooden house with seven pieces of longevity incense in his hand. After three times of soul refining, the color of the seven pieces of longevity incense is already dark purple. Although the three holy lines on the top are dim, they can still be seen clearly. Obviously, the feeling of longevity incense is quite different from that before.</p>
<p>Looking at the longevity incense in his hand, Bai Xiaochun felt thoughtful. At the moment, he was not as ignorant as before about the miraculous medicine. With the refining of the miraculous medicine, he gradually understood a lot. After refining, he knew that most of the impurities existed in any kind of elixir. These impurities were the part that could not be absorbed but were difficult to separate out. As they were swallowed, they would deposit in the body and gradually turned into the so-called medicine Poison.</p>
<p>This is also the reason why many elders in the clan are hesitant to swallow pills. In theory, a certain amount of poison will be excluded from the body. However, if more pills are swallowed, the more poison will naturally accumulate, which will hinder future practice.</p>
<p>Therefore, according to the amount of impurities, the elixir is divided into six levels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down, middle, up, good, excellent, extremely&hellip;&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun looks at the longevity fragrance in his hand and murmurs that impurities account for more than 90% of the total. It is a poison pill. If you don&rsquo;t have to, no one will eat it.</p>
<p>If the impurities account for about 80% of the total, they are called inferior. This kind of elixir is the most. If the impurities account for about 60%, it is called the middle grade. This kind of miraculous medicine is rare. Only a real pharmacist can refine it.</p>
<p>As for the impurities with only four layers, they are top-grade products, which are even rarer. The excellent products with only 20% impurities and 10% high-quality impurities can only appear occasionally at some large-scale auctions.</p>
<p>And that is not the slightest impurity of the best elixir, is rumored to have.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun gazed at longevity incense. He didn&rsquo;t understand it when he was refining the miraculous medicine before. Now when he observes carefully, he immediately realizes that the spirit refining of the miraculous medicine does not directly increase the power as a magic weapon, but Changed the quality of the panacea!</p>
<p>At the moment, the fragrance of longevity in his hand is only 40% impurity, which is a good product!</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun was very excited by this discovery. After pondering for a moment, he went to ziding mountain. Instead of looking for Zhang daphou, he went to the South Bank of Lingxi Zong. Only ziding mountain has a soul refining hall!</p>
<p>The disciples can make contributions here and ask the elders of the refining hall to help with the spirit refining. Although the probability of failure is not small, there are still many disciples who are keen on it.</p>
<p>In this refining hall, Bai Xiaochun observed and asked for help. When he left, he was sure that the elixir really could remove impurities.</p>
<p>Returning to Xiangyun mountain, Bai Xiaochun happily looked at the elixir she had refined, lit it and took a deep breath. She immediately felt that her body was obviously full of food, and the gusts of fragrance melted into her body, making her whole body warm. If life was a fire, then at this moment, he felt that the fire was added to a small firewood, which was more vigorous.</p>
<p>So while smelling the fragrance of longevity, he practiced immortal longevity. As long as he felt hungry, he took a deep breath, and that feeling would dissipate a lot.</p>
<p>Seven pieces of longevity incense supported Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s immortal life cultivation for half a month. After half a month, he obviously felt his immortal iron, stronger and stronger.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun raised her spirits and tidied up the storage bag. She immediately went down the mountain to Fangshi, where she sold Chen Fei&rsquo;s belongings, bought dozens of materials for refining longevity incense and refined the medicine again.</p>
<p>His success rate of refining longevity incense has also increased rapidly from 70% to 80% under his constant caution and care, and finally, he has kept above 10%.</p>
<p>However, Bai Xiaochun is still a little dissatisfied, because although his success rate has been raised to 10%, all the miraculous drugs that can be refined are inferior.</p>
<p>But it was difficult for him to improve in a short time, so he could only use spirit refining to get rid of impurities. In his daily practice, he took out longevity incense from time to time and took a hard breath. That feeling made him feel that the whole world was happy.</p>
<p>In this practice, his immortality and immortality increased with each passing day, and even his accomplishments were also improved, gradually approaching the great perfection of the sixth layer of condensate.</p>
<p>The fastest progress of the immortal longevity work, only a little less, can be immortal iron sheet. Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s whole body is more tenacious than before. When using the broken waiting lock, the black of both fingers is deepened.</p>
<p>At this time, however, the efficacy of longevity incense was gradually reduced. In the end, the effect was very little. Bai Xiaochun could only sigh. He understood that this was because the same elixir had absorbed too much and his body had adapted to it, so it had no effect.</p>
<p>If you want to continue to practice, you have to change a kind of elixir which is better than longevity incense. However, the prescription of this kind of elixir is strictly controlled. If you want to obtain it, you can only become a medicine apprentice, and then you can go to the sect to exchange for it.</p>
<p>Or go to some larger cities, but those cities are far away from the ancestral gate. Bai Xiaochun thinks about it and shows his determination in his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be promoted as a druggist!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He thought that with his experience in refining medicine and his attainments in plants and plants, he should have no problem in promoting himself to be a pharmacist. However, for the sake of insurance, he bought several other kinds of prescriptions, each of which was refined two or three times. After summing up the failure, he gradually got a good grasp of it before he went to the pharmacist&rsquo;s hall and applied for promotion.</p>
<p>This kind of promotion assessment will not be opened for one person. It will only be carried out after the number of people is almost the same. After waiting for another month, Bai Xiaochun is thinking about a problem in refining the elixir. Suddenly, the identity token in the storage bag vibrates. When he takes it out, an old voice echoes in his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow morning, in front of the pharmacist&rsquo;s hall, the promotion assessment of pharmacists will begin.&rdquo;</p>
