      <p>This hideous old man is an old devil in the demon sect who has been hidden for many years. He is called &ldquo;the blood sucking ancestor&rdquo;. People in the right way, including many people in the demon sect, privately call him &ldquo;the blood sucking old devil&rdquo;. The main reason for this is that the &ldquo;blood sucking method&rdquo; of the evil sect he practiced is to suck the blood essence of the living people into the body before he can practice it, which is very strange and terrible.</p>
<p>However, although the magic is powerful, it also has the power to backfire on the practitioners themselves. Therefore, everyone who practices the blood sucking magic has a ferocious face, which can&rsquo;t be seen in the world. It&rsquo;s the devil cult, which also has private criticism.</p>
<p>But then again, this magic is very important. When he was born a hundred years ago, there was a bloodbath, which made people in the right path have a headache. But later, the evil cult lost its power, and the right way fought hand in hand. In order to escape the pursuit of those high people in the right way, the old demon of blood sucking gradually withdrew from the Central Plains with the evil cult. There was no news after that.</p>
<p>This time, the demons revived, and the old blood sucking demons, who were originally one of the four sects of the demons, were invited out. Before he left the mountain, Jiang Laosan, the only disciple of his family, was pulled to help boxing by them because he was similar to the wild dog Taoist and Liu Hao. Unexpectedly, he was killed in wanbat ancient cave for some reason.</p>
<p>The blood sucking old demon was furious when he knew it. You need to know his pulse, because the reputation of blood sucking magic is too bad, and the cultivation process is dangerous and unpredictable. He was accidentally backfired by the magic and died of blood explosion. So there are few people willing to practice in the devil way. Jiang Laosan is a disciple whom he only took a fancy to ten years ago. His temperament is just right for his strange temper, so he likes it very much in his heart. Unexpectedly, this time he died in obscurity. How can he not be furious?</p>
<p>Recently, there was a lot of movement in the demon sect. The ghost King sect first started to come to Liubo mountain, a remote place in the East China Sea. Then, the other three sects sent reinforcements successively. The blood sucking old demon was one of them. That is to say, I came to Liubo mountain today. It&rsquo;s a coincidence that he happened to meet a family of people in the blood refining hall, such as the wild dog Taoist.</p>
<p>Year old, Liu Hao and so on are all crafty people. At first sight, the blood sucking old demon looks gloomy. Knowing that the old devil was eccentric and violent, he expected that he would still hate the death of his apprentice, so he put oil on his feet and ran away.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that the temperament of the wild dog Taoist is a straight one, but a slow one.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, he went up to greet the old blood sucking demon and said, &ldquo;ah! Old master, I haven&rsquo;t seen you for many years. I don&rsquo;t want to be healthy as before. &quot;</p>
<p>Before half of what he said, the old blood sucking demon thought that the wild dog should be killed. He killed my apprentice and didn&rsquo;t say it. How dare he satirize me for being old but not dead? In a rage, he picked up the wild dog Taoist. The wild dog Taoist just feels wrong. He&rsquo;s scared to beg for mercy.</p>
<p>The old blood sucking demon said nothing but to him, &ldquo;now let&rsquo;s go to Qingyun gate. Find the son of a bitch who killed my apprentice. If you can&rsquo;t find him, I&rsquo;ll drain your blood and offer a sacrifice to my apprentice. &quot;</p>
<p>The wild dog that these words say only has no human face and cannot stop crying.</p>
<p>Since he came to Liubo mountain, Zhang Xiaofan has seen the wild dog Taoist several times, but the wild dog Taoist was not fighting with others, or running away in the air, and did not see Zhang Xiaofan. Zhang Xiaofan also hid in the dark when he was in the secret cave. When he came out, the wild dog had already rushed out with others, and had a lively fight with the orthodox disciple &ldquo;pingpingpingpang&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The wild dog thought, who knows if that little bastard has come to Liubo mountain. In case he didn&rsquo;t come, the blood sucking old demon was furious, would he not die unjustly? Now he begged more than that. But the blood sucking old demon was as iron hearted as a stone and turned a deaf ear to him. Carrying him, he secretly flew to the place where the people in the middle of the road lived.</p>
<p>It was in the dark forest. Suddenly I saw the figure of Zhang Xiaofan. The wild dog Taoist was really overjoyed. He was even happier than his own father and mother. He cried out at once, &ldquo;he is right. I know him even when he turns grey! &quot;</p>
<p>The old blood sucking demon gave a cold Snort and threw it gently on his hand. He threw the wild dog away like something else. Zhang Xiaofan heard a dull sound in the distance for a while, and then there was a cry of pain. He didn&rsquo;t know whether he fell to the ground or hit a tree?</p>
<p>The blood sucking old demon looked up and down at the young disciple of Qingyun sect in front of him, but he didn&rsquo;t make an immediate move, instead, he frowned. Although he is violent, he is not totally irrational. On that day, after seeing the corpse of Jiang Laosan sent by the blood refining hall, he was furious and sad, and then found something strange.</p>
<p>How do you think that the death method of Jiang Laosan&rsquo;s Dried flesh and blood is caused by the blood sucking magic in his own family? Is there anyone else in the world who practices this &ldquo;magic skill&rdquo; besides himself and Jiang Laosan?</p>
<p>Naturally, he didn&rsquo;t know that there was a &ldquo;blood bead&rdquo; handed down by the black hearted old man, the elder of the demon sect, on the fire stick in Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s hand. However, from his vision of hundreds of years of practice, he quickly determined that the &ldquo;murderer&rdquo; was at least similar to the blood sucking magic, even if it wasn&rsquo;t using the blood sucking magic, and the Taoism was not low, even if it wasn&rsquo;t under his own. So now when I see Zhang Xiaofan, he gets angry. First, I have a close look at him. What&rsquo;s so strange about him?</p>
<p>But he looked east and West. His brows were wrinkled, but he still couldn&rsquo;t see why. From head to foot, and then from foot to head, this kid is still just a common disciple of Qingyun sect. There is no outstanding place, not to mention the cruel and violent spirit of blood sucking demon.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was standing in the same place, but he was a little confused by this old man with ghost spirit. He didn&rsquo;t know who he was. But when he was with the wild dog Taoist, he must have come from the demon sect. It seems that they came here to find themselves.</p>
<p>The red skull with red light in the middle of the sky began to rotate slowly again. The voice of the blood sucking old demon came from behind the red light coldly: &ldquo;the little boy of Qingyun gate, did you kill my apprentice Jiang Laosan? &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was stunned and said, &ldquo;who is Jiang Laosan? &quot;</p>
<p>The blood sucking old demon smothers for a while, his heart is furious, he has already used a magic to drain this guy&rsquo;s blood. It&rsquo;s just a thought that the disciples of Qingyun sect should have a blood sucking skill with good practice, which should be made clear in any case.</p>
<p>He suppressed his anger, but his voice sounded like a ghost crying and howling, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the one you killed with the blood sucking method in the wanbat ancient cave of kongsang mountain! &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s heart was shocked. He listened to the word &ldquo;sucking blood&rdquo; again, and immediately thought about it. He could not help but feel the terrible scene in his mind. Subconsciously to the waist of the fire stick to touch.</p>
<p>The staff of fire is still at his waist, like a sleeping devil.</p>
<p>Seeing that he was speechless for a long time, the blood sucking old demon seemed to be in a trance. He really didn&rsquo;t take himself to the extreme. Ten times more arrogant than those Qingyun sect masters who chased and killed themselves.</p>
<p>He has always been violent. If there is no doubt in his heart, how could he endure such a long time? This anger is very small, and he roared, &ldquo;boy of Qingyun gate. Return my life! &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was shocked and stepped back. Only listening to the sound of crying around, the wind is chilly, the body is cold, even the back of his neck is chilly, the cold hairs all over his body seem to stand up.</p>
<p>The red skull in the middle of the sky suddenly opened its gloomy mouth. In an instant, five black lights flashed from that mouth and fell to Zhang Xiaofan. After a while, he stood up shivering.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan is on guard. He knows that the demons and demons are weird. But when he looks carefully, he can&rsquo;t help his scalp numbing. Only the five growing up figures are five monsters with different descriptions, but the same ferocious faces, or bloody mouths, or fangs and sharp teeth, stinking and filthy. It&rsquo;s coming.</p>
<p>Within a short time, the Five ghosts had grown up to a giant half a body taller than Zhang Xiaofan. Behind them, the blood sucking old demon had strange seals on his hands. On the red skull, click or pat it, shake it from time to time, and the ghosts move accordingly, obviously controlled by the old devil.</p>
<p>At the moment, it seems that the red light from the skull is set off. Even the eyes of the blood sucking old demon seem to be red. With a sneer, his hands clenched and hissed, he held the red skull firmly.</p>
<p>Almost corresponding to his actions, the eyes of the five huge ghosts suddenly all turned red and bright, giving out a deep and fierce look, at the same time, looking up and howling to the sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Woo ah&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s body was shocked and his mind was seized. He only felt that the ghosts around him were flashing. The sound of crying was like a cone through his ears, which was directly inserted into his head. He was in great pain.</p>
<p>The Five ghosts howled up to the sky. After a while, they came together. The wind was howling. Zhang Xiaofan tried to hide behind. The danger escaped the attack. But before he calmed down, the Five ghosts started to work together. In the howling sound, they put their ghost claws into the ground.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan holds the fire stick tightly in his hand in the middle of the sky. He feels at ease. It seems that the fire stick also feels something. It glows with a pale blue light and gradually lights up.</p>
<p>But before he could think more, the Five ghosts were deeply inserted into the claws of the ground, as if they had grabbed the ground. In the long howling sound, the wind was blowing, and the whole ground was pulled up.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s more terrifying is that from that underground, countless ghosts of different sizes flew out to Zhang Xiaofan and surrounded him in an instant.</p>
<p>There was a sneer on the old blood sucking demon&rsquo;s lips, but then he frowned again. Because he was afraid that the young man was only afraid of physical ability, he didn&rsquo;t use his family skills to suck blood at first. Instead, he used a set of proud magic skills - &ldquo;Five ghosts resist spirit&rdquo;, which he had cultivated in recent years. With the five &ldquo;life ghosts&rdquo; refined from their own spirits as the medium, all the dead spirits and ghosts in the nearby ten li area are forcibly detained, and then refined by the technique of fierce ghosts, all of them become the spirits that devour the flesh and blood of the living spirits and attack Zhang Xiaofan.</p>
<p>But this disciple of Qingyun, though he is not low in Taoism, doesn&rsquo;t seem to practice any blood sucking skills. Is he wrong? Or wild dog that guy in order to survive, casually pointed to a ghost for himself?</p>
<p>The old blood sucking demon was thinking about it. Suddenly, he seemed to feel something. He was shocked and looked forward. I saw that Zhang Xiaofan had been surrounded by countless white ghosts and spirits, but I couldn&rsquo;t see the figure. Suddenly, in the eyes of those white ghosts, there was a dark dark green light, shining through countless ghosts.</p>
<p>The sound, like something torn, was crisp and loud.</p>
<p>The night on Liubo mountain is even darker. At this moment, even the dim light of the moon is gradually out of sight.</p>
<p>In the lonely and bleak night, there was a faint roar.</p>
<p>Even the waves of the distant sea seem to be surging.</p>
<p>That cold feeling, from the heart, quietly passing</p>
<p>The fire stick is so bright that the originally dark body of the stick looks like a demon suddenly waking up and opens his eyes. In an instant, the cold and violent atmosphere was lifted from Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s body. Countless spirits are flying with fear and fear.</p>
<p>The old blood sucking demon in the distance frowned, and his face gradually became solemn. He whispered to himself, &ldquo;what a heavy evil spirit!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Those five great ghosts. Howling in unison, his body shape flashed, &ldquo;abetting&rdquo; several times rose up and fell around Zhang Xiaofan, surrounding him in the middle. At the same time, the ghost claws tear to the air, and the sharp voice starts.</p>
<p>Just now, because of the mysterious evil spirit on the fire stick, the spirit was frightened. At this moment, it suddenly stopped in the air. Zhang Xiaofan clearly saw that many of the faces that had been transformed into human shapes had the color of pain. But after a moment, they became ferocious again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! &quot;</p>
<p>The shrill ghost roars, breaks through the air but leaves, innumerable ghosts return to the body and descend. Toward the only flesh and blood body in the scene, he pounced on it.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan took a breath of cool air, only to see the white ghosts around him, and they came in a rush, just in a hurry. It&rsquo;s just that I haven&rsquo;t waited for him to parry for a few times, but when I saw the ghosts all over the sky, they pressed him down like a thick cloud, forcing him back to the ground. Zhang Xiaofan gnawed his teeth and supported him, but I haven&rsquo;t waited for him to parry for a few times. All of a sudden, he stumbled and his feet hurt so much that he almost fell to the ground.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was shocked and looked down. In the soil under his feet, he held out two huge ghost hands and grasped his feet firmly. The ghost claws were sharp and almost pierced into his blood. Around, there were five ghosts. Now there are only four left.</p>
<p>In the middle of the air, countless spirits cheered and swarmed in screaming. The greedy mouths seemed to be in front of them.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s face was pale, his muscles seemed to be twisted, and he could bear the sharp pain. He made a quick stroke in front of his body with his right hand knot formula, and the fire stick rose in the air. With a sound of &ldquo;woo&rdquo; in the air, he flashed a light wall, a faint blue light, and then again.</p>
<p>The first several spirits rushed down. They couldn&rsquo;t stop. Sheng Sheng ran into the black stick. He didn&rsquo;t even scream, but it turned into smoke.</p>
<p>At the same time, Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s body vibrated again and looked down, but he saw that the ghost claw was like a sharp blade, which had already cut his skin, and the red blood flowed out, dripping on the Black Ghost claw.</p>
<p>That delicious, sweet, blood breath! In the air, it radiates immediately.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was stunned.</p>
<p>The countless spirits flying and screaming in the sky were also stunned.</p>
<p>The light on the fire stick seems to vibrate slightly, just like the breath connected with one&rsquo;s own blood is stimulated.</p>
<p>A moment later, countless spirits rushed down to the sweet flesh and blood. Just in that place where the wind is biting, but someone raises his head and shouts. The fire stick fell down. Zhang Xiaofan grabbed it. No matter the spirit above, he widened his eyes. There was a faint red light shaking in his eyes.</p>
<p>Put it in!</p>
<p>Insert down!</p>
<p>Through the ghost claw, through his own blood!</p>
<p>Red blood, attached to the black stick body, quietly seeped in. All of a sudden, the red blood on the fire stick lit up together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pounce! In the depths of the earth there was a muffled sound. All the spirits above are suddenly stopped, and their faces are afraid, just like the devil burning the ghost in the legend.</p>
<p>In the dark, it seems that there is only the light of the fire stick shining.</p>
<p>In the distance, the red skull in the old blood sucking demon&rsquo;s hand suddenly made a low and crisp sound, and suddenly broke a piece on the right side.</p>
<p>The old blood sucking demon&rsquo;s face changed a lot. He suddenly looked up. The young man was one of the Five ghosts in his array. And in the scene, the four ghosts who are missing a corner obviously can&rsquo;t control so many ghosts. Gradually, some of them escape.</p>
<p>The ground around Zhang Xiaofan suddenly sank, half a foot deep. The ghost claws on his feet were slowly released, turned into bloody blood and infiltrated into the ground.</p>
<p>However, he didn&rsquo;t wait for a sigh of relief, but only listened to the sky full of ghosts and Howling together. He was frightened. He was about to resist, but he saw that countless ghosts were flying around. He saw the white light, the ghost roaring, the spirits flying, and the red light flashing</p>
<p>Red light?</p>
<p>Through the innumerable white ghosts, the red light, such as electricity and light, flashing skull, has come to our eyes. Zhang Xiaofan was about to jump up, but he felt a pain at his feet. He was involved in the wound he had just suffered. His body was unstable, but he could not get away.</p>
<p>He saw the red skeleton open his mouth and bite it like a devil. Zhang Xiaofan was shocked and stopped himself with a fire stick. But there was a dry hand in the mouth between the lightning and the flint, and it grew three feet. Five fingers into claws, heavily grasps on his chest.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s body was shocked. In an instant, he only looked at the ghost hand. His dry skin suddenly seemed to be filled with blood. It&rsquo;s plump. In an instant, he felt dizzy in his mind. He felt that all his blood was flowing back to the wound on his chest.</p>
<p>This is the old blood sucking demon&rsquo;s ability to watch the house. Seeing Zhang Xiaofan controlled by him, he couldn&rsquo;t help laughing. After a big drink, he stretched out his arms, but he raised the young man&rsquo;s body to the air and shouted, &ldquo;son, return my life! &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was caught in his hands, and his whole body was suffering from the adverse blood flow. His mind was gradually blurred, and he could only use his last strength to fight for death and beat the firebrand to the ghost hand, but he had no strength at all. Like a feather.</p>
<p>The old blood sucking demon didn&rsquo;t put it in his eyes at all. He snorted, but he thought to himself: this young man has nothing else, and the Taoist method is only ordinary, but the magic weapon in his hand is very strange. After a while, he will suck up his blood, but he will take the things like the burning stick back to have a good look.</p>
<p>At this time, the fire stick fell on the hand that he grabbed Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s chest.</p>
<p>The black and blue beads cut through the blood sucking skin.</p>
<p>The blood under the skin. What seems to be calling?</p>
<p>The old blood sucking demon suddenly screamed, let go of Zhang Xiaofan, jumped back and looked into his hands. I saw the plump skin due to blood absorption. Almost in an instant, it suddenly dried up, even worse than the original.</p>
<p>But in front, Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s body was crumbling, but the fire stick in his hand, especially the bead on the top of the stick. But strangely, the blood around it is shining red.</p>
<p>The old blood sucking demon suddenly sneered and said, &ldquo;I said that elder Jiang can die like this. It&rsquo;s strange here. Hey, there is such a treasure in the world. Boy, bring your life together! &quot;</p>
<p>He said that his body was flying, and his hands were like claws. This time, he put them straight into Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s head. Poor Zhang Xiaofan is weak at the moment and can&rsquo;t resist any more. He is going to die under the claw of this blood sucking old demon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Demon! &quot;</p>
<p>A break drink, full of anger, the hot heat wave suddenly broke the air and came, such as a huge wave emptying, sweeping the whole forest. Within ten feet of them, all the trees withered in an instant. There was only one brilliant fire light falling from the sky, tearing up all the dark clouds.</p>
<p>The old blood sucking demon lost his color in a panic. He came to visit the world with a high level of Taoism, which was extraordinary. He could not care about hurting Zhang Xiaofan. His hands retreated quickly. In the howling sound, the red skeleton blood was so great that a red wall of light rose up in front of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boom&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such as thunder falling and roaring, fire on the blood wall, hissing heat wave, roaring, turning into a red fairy sword in a moment, shaking. Huge force, the old blood sucking demon straight back, straight back a few feet away, this force is not slightly reduced, still like the mountain roaring straight over.</p>
<p>The old blood sucking demon&rsquo;s face turned white and cried out. The formula changed. Ten fingers moved in a row. In a moment, two blood lights came out of the red skull&rsquo;s eyes. Through the blood wall, he hit the red sword.</p>
<p>In the loud sound, the red fairy sword flies back, and the blood sucking old demon&rsquo;s body is also shocked. Only after a few steps back can he stand still.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Red flame! &ldquo;The blood sucking old demon suddenly had a chill in his eyes, and his face was like frost.</p>
<p>The fiery heat waves flashed back, and the fire flashed through the place. It was not easy for Tian to appear slowly. There was another figure behind him. It was Su Ru who held Zhang Xiaofan who was about to fall. Zhang Xiaofan felt warm when he saw that Shifu came.</p>
<p>Seeing Su Ru&rsquo;s worried face, she looked at him and said in a low voice, &ldquo;Xiaofan, are you ok? &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan smiled hard and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ok, Shiniang.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t say half of what he said. Suddenly, Venus flashed in front of him. Then it was dark, but he fainted.</p>
<p>Su Ru frowns tightly, and Tian is not easy to ignore the blood sucking old demon, but she first looks at Zhang Xiaofan.</p>
<p>After a while, Su Ru finished checking. She reached into her arms and took out a bottle, poured out a yellow pill, and took it to Zhang Xiaofan. Then she nodded to Zhu Tian, saying softly, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t die. &ldquo;After a pause, he looked at the blood sucking old demon in the distance, and there was indignation in his eyes,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s the blood sucking skill! &quot;</p>
<p>Tian is not easy to face a flash of anger, turn around, and blood sucking old demon&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old blood sucking demon, you have been famous for hundreds of years. How can you deal with a younger generation by such a mean? &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bah! &ldquo;The blood sucking old demon said fiercely,&rdquo; your apprentice&rsquo;s life is life, and my apprentice&rsquo;s life is not life? &quot;</p>
<p>Tian is not easy to say coldly, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter with your ghost apprentice? &quot;</p>
<p>The old blood sucking demon stared and said, &ldquo;he killed my apprentice under the ancient cave of wanbat in kongsang mountain, and I will kill him. So what? &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good! &ldquo;Tian was not easy to suddenly drink,&rdquo; kill well! &quot;</p>
<p>The old demon was stunned.</p>
<p>Tian was not easy to sneer and said, &ldquo;I have always looked down on my apprentice, but today, when I see him, he is more promising than I thought, and he knows how to do harm to the people! &quot;</p>
<p>The old blood sucking demon was very angry. He said angrily, &ldquo;OK, you son of a bitch, you fell down a hundred years ago and killed me. Today, I will see your red flame sword again! &quot;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not easy for Tian to breathe deeply. His right hand flies across the sky. For a moment, the red flame fairy sword vibrates slightly as if hearing the master&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A hundred years ago, I let you get away with it. Today, let me have a look again. How far has your blood sucking skill, which dares to bully my apprentice, come? (to be continued). )</p>
