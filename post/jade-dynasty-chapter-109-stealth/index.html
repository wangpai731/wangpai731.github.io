      <p>The mountains in southern Xinjiang are quite different from those in the Central Plains, which are a little less beautiful and secluded, and a little more majestic and precipitous.</p>
<p>Under the night, a series of rolling mountains stand towering, crisscross, far away, it is a sense of annihilation.</p>
<p>With his hand in his hand, he stood up and looked up. There were two lower hills and a relatively flat wilderness. Suddenly, four tall peaks rose up on the earth, which were linked to form a valley. Behind these four tall mountains, under the boundless night, there are countless shadows. It is the boundless one hundred thousand mountains in the south border.</p>
<p>And in the front of the four peaks, is the famous burning incense valley.</p>
<p>It was a night of deep darkness, with the moon hanging high, and a few shimmering stars looming in the sky. Under the cold and clear light, there seems to be fog in the valley in the distance. It floats lightly. It looks like a gossamer mist, with some mystery in the beauty.</p>
<p>Ghost Li frowned and took back his eyes.</p>
<p>It was the third day. Since that night three days ago, he and jinpinger of the joy sect of the demon sect suddenly found that the burning incense Valley seemed to be secretly colluding with the southern barbarians in the 100000 mountains of Southern Xinjiang, so they decided to secretly investigate the burning incense valley. &ldquo;Burning incense Valley&rdquo; in the southern border here, naturally is thunderous, two people easily know where burning incense valley. But when we really want to enter secretly, we find that things are quite troublesome.</p>
<p>Incense Valley covers a wide area, so it should not be difficult to sneak in. It&rsquo;s true that the two of them, by virtue of their own Taoism, easily escaped the ordinary disciples of the burning incense Valley who were on the alert day and night. However, when they went to the burning incense Valley, no matter how they hid their bodies, they would suddenly ring a strange clear bell nearby, which attracted countless people from the burning incense Valley to search carefully. Among them, there were extraordinary experts.</p>
<p>Guili and jinpinger are both alert people. They all saw the opportunity early several times and withdrew in time, but no matter how careful they were, they still couldn&rsquo;t escape the inexplicable bell. After a few days, it still can&rsquo;t go deep, but there seems to be a sense of vigilance in the burning Valley, and more people have been sent to patrol day and night.</p>
<p>The ghost and the fierce thought for a long time. But I still can&rsquo;t figure out how the burning Valley did not know their trace. It seems that this burning Valley, which is one of the three great sects in the world, is indeed crouching tiger, hidden dragon.</p>
<p>At this time, the little gray, who had been lying quietly on his shoulder, suddenly moved, and a low cry came from behind:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turn around. There was a fire in a small clearing in the forest. The Golden Vase sat in front of him, holding a stick on which he was barbecued with a washed rabbit. At the moment, she frowned and looked at the stick in her hand, looking rather depressed.</p>
<p>Ghost Li walked past.</p>
<p>In the past three days, he and jinping&rsquo;er have tried to sneak into the incense Valley for several times, all of which ended in failure. In ordinary days, the relationship between the two is quite delicate, seemingly peaceful. Secretly, they are on their own guard. They all know that the other side is a deep-seated and ruthless person. No one knows whether the other side will suddenly hurt the killer.</p>
<p>When she came near the campfire, the little ash on her shoulder &ldquo;squeaked&rdquo; but jumped to the ground. She looked at the Golden Vase and was shocked. She looked helplessly at the hare strung on the stick in her hand. One of the hare&rsquo;s legs was scorched.</p>
<p>The two of them spent a few days outside the burning incense Valley, waiting for the mountains. Naturally, there is no Village Inn around. After a few days of dry food, it&rsquo;s OK to be cruel, but jinpinger can&rsquo;t stand it. This evening I saw a hare running by. I caught it and made a fire for a change. Anyway, they are far away from the burning incense Valley, but they are not afraid to be found.</p>
<p>But now it seems that although jinpinger has a high level of Taoism, in the past, he had no experience of barbecue in the wild. Several times down, the technique is not good, even the food is burnt black. This time, I stood in front of him, half crouching on the ground. Four eyes of a man and a monkey fell on the burnt rabbit&rsquo;s leg. Gold bottle son&rsquo;s face unexpectedly a red, slowly retracted the stick back, left the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Squeak, squeak&hellip;&rdquo; Suddenly, there was a strange sound, but the monkey grinned. He fell on the ground. His tail was very high. He shook it and shook it. His right hand clenched his fist. He kept pounding the ground. It seemed that he could not bear it. He even made a strange action.</p>
<p>Jin Ping&rsquo;er and GUI Li are both stunned at the same time. A moment later, both of them come back to their senses. Jin Ping&rsquo;er&rsquo;s face is even angrier than before. GUI Li doesn&rsquo;t know that the monkey is following him. He rarely leaves once, but where did he learn this set of inexplicable joke skills. At the moment, he took a look at the Golden Vase, coughed, kicked his left foot lightly, and kicked out the gray haired monkey who had been beating the ground.</p>
<p>The little ash rolled away like a gourd, but the sound of &ldquo;squeak&rdquo; came from afar.</p>
<p>GUI Li and Jin Ping&rsquo;er look at each other, and the atmosphere is embarrassed. GUI Li looks at the stick in Jin Ping&rsquo;er&rsquo;s hand, then moves a stone from the side, sits on it, and says to Jin Ping&rsquo;er, &ldquo;give it to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gold bottle son smell speech one Leng, only see ghost fierce complexion light, reached out to take his hand the wooden stick in the past, first tear off the burnt part, then put on the fire again, slowly turn over barbecue. His barbecue was quite different from that of the Golden Vase. He saw the tongues on fire, the sticks turning gently. After a while, a faint fragrance drifted away.</p>
<p>The Golden Vase son raised his eyes and gave the ghost a sharp look. Under the light of the fire, his pale face became ruddy at the moment. In his dark eyes, there were two small burning flames.</p>
<p>A man who is concentrating on barbecue for himself</p>
<p>In the air, there was a sudden silence. No one spoke anymore. The Golden Vase slowly took back her eyes, picked up some dead branches from her hand, put them into the fire, and the flame gradually burned up, submerging the dead branches. From time to time, there was a crackling sound of the dead branches.</p>
<p>In the distance, it seems that there is a night wind blowing through the forest, and there is a gentle rustle of branches and leaves, which falls on the heart.</p>
<p>Little grey didn&rsquo;t know when he came back. He had a few more wild fruits in his hand. It seems that he had just run to the woods to pick them. It went to the fire, looked around, and sat down at the feet of ghost Li. It took the wild fruit to its mouth, opened its mouth and chewed it up. At the same time, it shook its long tail and wrapped it on ghost Li&rsquo;s feet.</p>
<p>Just like this in silence for a long time, the fragrance in the air is more and more thick. The whole body of the hare on the top of the fire gradually emits grease. It drips down slowly. When you look at the oil, it&rsquo;s shiny. It&rsquo;s very exciting. Jin pinger couldn&rsquo;t help looking at it more.</p>
<p>After another moment, the ghost looked at the rabbit carefully, and took the stick back. He held it in one hand, but stretched it to his waist. After a while, I felt out a few small bottles and sprinkled some seemingly powdery things on the rabbit from the middle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; said the gold bottle</p>
<p>Ghost Li smiled. Looking at Jin Ping&rsquo;er, he somehow felt that he was a little bitter. He just listened to ghost Li lightly and said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s some salt seasoning. It&rsquo;s an old problem. I take it everywhere.&rdquo; Then he handed the stick to the gold vase.</p>
<p>Gold bottle son hesitated for a moment, but didn&rsquo;t reach for.</p>
<p>A ghostly glance. With a smile of indifference, he reached for a piece of rabbit meat and put it into his mouth.</p>
<p>The gold bottle son&rsquo;s face was red for a while. In the fire, there was a charming color between her eyes and eyebrows. It was touching. After a while, she reached out to take the stick and whispered: &ldquo;thank you very much, young master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost is sharp and speechless, turns to turn to go, conveniently took a wild fruit from the small ash hand. Put it to your mouth, take a bite and eat it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>All of a sudden, there was another light shout from the Golden Vase. It seems that he still has a little pain. Ghost Li and monkey Xiaohui look up at her at the same time, but see Jin Ping&rsquo;er&rsquo;s white hand covering his mouth, showing his eyebrows slightly wrinkled, with the color of pain hidden. But she suddenly found that ghost Li and little ash looked over, and her face was red. After a while, he said, &ldquo;I was burned by accident&hellip;&rdquo; When it comes to the back, the voice is getting smaller.</p>
<p>After hearing this, the corners of his mouth moved, but there was no change in his face, but the little ash beside his feet suddenly made a sound. In the squeaking sound, he grinned, half of the wild fruit on his right hand fell on the ground, and then he clenched his fist and thumped to the ground. It seemed that he wanted to do that strange gesture again.</p>
<p>Jinpinger&rsquo;s eyes were fixed, his heart was shy and angry, but he didn&rsquo;t wait for her reaction, nor for Xiaohui&rsquo;s hand to hit the ground. Guili had already kicked Xiaohui out like a gourd rolling on the ground.</p>
<p>After a while, only listen to ghost Li light way: &ldquo;the animal does not understand, you do not see strange.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The golden bottle looked at him, calmed down, nodded and smiled. Then it blew a little air to the rabbit that had been barbecued. Then it tore a piece of meat from the top with a white and green finger and chewed it on the edge of its mouth.</p>
<p>At this entrance, the spirit of the Golden Vase was suddenly refreshed. In a moment, she felt that the fragrance seemed to have a spirit, and it ran all over her body. Her body seemed to be a little lighter and full of saliva. It was a delicious taste that had never been seen before. The skin on the outside is crispy but not burnt, thin and crispy; the meat in the inside is smooth and tender, plus the seasoning that I don&rsquo;t know how to mix. The delicacy is as refreshing as the heart. This taste can&rsquo;t be stopped. It&rsquo;s almost lost. It&rsquo;s unexpected that this delicacy is made by the man in front of me.</p>
<p>Rao is jinpinger, who has a deep road and a firm mind. At the moment, he also has a big appetite. He tore off one piece after another. However, after a while, he has eaten a rabbit leg, which makes him feel a little full. He stops.</p>
<p>Then he smiled, looked at the ghost, and said, &ldquo;you are so skilled. An ordinary rabbit can be barbecued so delicious!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this time, little grey monkey has run back, lying beside GUI Li, a pair of extremely flexible monkey eyes turn around, look at GUI Li for a while, and look at Jin Ping&rsquo;er for a while.</p>
<p>Ghost Li light way: &ldquo;carve insect small skill, let the girl see smile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Golden Vase smiled at her, her eyes were charming, her eyes filled with water, and she said softly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never eaten such a delicious rabbit in my life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost Li lightly smile, just want to say something, but the body suddenly a shock, in the eyes of a confusion.</p>
<p>This sentence, this voice, this Yingying smile, suddenly turned in my mind. The night was quiet, and the wind was cold, but his heart and mouth suddenly hurt, rolling up like a raging sea.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, I even heard these words.</p>
<p>It was a time of dust in the past years, but inadvertently, it came to my mind.</p>
<p>Qingqing brook, phosphorous phosphorous, Yingying smile, gentle wind</p>
<p>Kongsang mountain, after the cliff, the two people who just got away from the dead, surrounded by the fire, are also barbecue.</p>
<p>The smiling figure in green clothes suddenly drowned him and occupied all the gaps in his mind. He could not help shaking.</p>
<p>Biyao</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s delicious. The best thing I&rsquo;ve eaten in my life is the rabbit you roast now. &quot;</p>
<p>In those days, the words echoed in my mind and gradually became thorns. Into a needle, into the heart.</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>&ldquo;Son, son?&rdquo; A little surprised voice sounded in his ear, pulling the spirit back to reality.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know when Jin Ping&rsquo;er got up. He still had the stick in his left hand, but somehow his right hand shrank into his sleeve.</p>
<p>As soon as the ghost&rsquo;s eyes were fixed, he took a deep breath, calmed down and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ok.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gold bottle son looked at him deeply, the look in the eyes changed, light voice way: &ldquo;childe, how is your face so pale, what matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at her in the eye. Suddenly smiled and said, &ldquo;what can I do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gold bottle son looked at him, in the eyes faintly pure light slowly took back, between the eyebrow and the eye charming color floated again, smiled way: &ldquo;the childe is OK.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly, the ghost was upset, but his face didn&rsquo;t show. He was trying to say something. The quiet little ash around him suddenly moved and looked back.</p>
<p>Guili and jinpinger stand up if they feel something at the same time. Looking to the south, I saw the southern sky, the quiet burning incense valley surrounded by the mountains, and suddenly a shriek came from afar. A red light rose from the sky, illuminating the sky, and then slowly fell.</p>
<p>The light in the eyes of ghost Li and Jin Ping&rsquo;er brightened at the same time.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>In the burning incense Valley, the lights, which were originally extinguished at night, were all lit one by one.</p>
<p>Or far or near the voice, mixed with a few disturbed sleep low angry curse. Gradually it began to ring. But in this gradually increasing noise, the angry voice mixed with the strange like the roar of wild animals, came in from the entrance of the burning incense valley.</p>
<p>A moment later, the sound of fighting was heard, and at the same time, the clear bell and the alarm bell echoed over the valley at the same time. In the middle of the night, it turned out that some foreign enemies had forcibly attacked the burning incense valley.</p>
<p>The ghost and the Golden Vase, who were hiding on the other hill, came to see the light at the entrance of the burning incense Valley, and the figure who was rushing from the burning incense Valley to the entrance from time to time, were all surprised.</p>
<p>Who on earth dare to offend the burning incense Valley, which is known as one of the top leaders in the world? Even with their two outstanding masters of the new generation of demon sect, they only consider whether they can sneak into the burning incense valley.</p>
<p>Originally, when they just arrived here, jinpinger could not help but whisper, &ldquo;is it your ghost King clan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li naturally denies it, but he thinks about it, but he really can&rsquo;t think of any other force in the world besides devil cult?</p>
<p>Seeing the noise of people in the burning incense Valley in the night, after a while, there are still people walking towards the entrance of the valley. Look at this situation, the situation there is not calming down, but there is a trend of deterioration.</p>
<p>GUI Li and Jin Ping&rsquo;er frowned slightly, but now this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. GUI Li then whispered to Jin Ping&rsquo;er: &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jin Ping&rsquo;er nodded, but she looked at the ghost and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very interested in the things at the entrance of the valley. Why don&rsquo;t we take the chance to have a look first?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ghost Li ponders for a moment, shakes his head way: &ldquo;you go, I go into burning incense valley deep place to see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gold bottle son seemed to be stunned in the dark, then said: &ldquo;well, then you are careful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly, the word &ldquo;be careful&rdquo; appeared from the mouth of Jin Ping&rsquo;er. It seemed strange. But Jin Ping&rsquo;er just smiled at his eyes and suddenly turned into a light streamer. He slipped down the ridge quietly and disappeared in the dark after a while.</p>
<p>The ghost Li frowned, and there was a glimmer of light in his eyes.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Although the history of the burning incense valley construction school is not comparable to that of Qingyun sect and demon sect, it has been operating here for more than 800 years. In the shadow of the night, ghost and Li sneak in, facing each other is a patchwork of halls and pavilions. Looking at the architectural style, it is quite similar to the Central Plains, but in the subtle places, such as the window lintel and eaves corner, we can see some beasts carved from time to time, which is not found in the Central Plains. Obviously, in the past 800 years, the burning incense Valley has also been influenced by the rough local customs in the southern border area.</p>
<p>At the entrance of the valley, there was still a lot of noise, and the alarm bell, which was the most headache of the ghost and the golden bottle, was also ringing all the time. The place he is now careful to hide is in the shadow behind a big rock at the foot of the mountain. The last time I sneaked in, i.e. to take a few more steps here. Suddenly the inexplicable clear bell rang.</p>
<p>At the moment, I only heard that the bell rang in the distance. Three feet in front of the big stone was a vacant lot, and then there was a house of ordinary style. It seemed to be the residence of the disciples of the burning incense valley.</p>
<p>Ghost Li took a deep breath. Standing up straight in the shadow, looking around, there is a quiet area nearby. Compared with the noise in the distance, there is no voice. As for the disciples of incense Valley in that room. Seems to have been summoned to the entrance of the valley.</p>
<p>In this strange and inexplicable quiet, the ghost walked forward slowly.</p>
<p>One step, two steps</p>
<p>He walked very slowly. He walked five steps all the time. Everything around him was as usual.</p>
<p>But the look on his face was even more solemn, because the last time he was here, he was found by the strange bell when he stepped out the sixth step.</p>
<p>The light in his eyes gradually brightened and swept slowly around. But there is still no change around here.</p>
<p>After a moment, he took the sixth step slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Methotrexate&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Almost at the same time that his foot was on the ground, the clear bell suddenly rang in front of him and spread far away in the silence.</p>
<p>As soon as the body of ghost Li was stiff, he was shocked and angry. The ghost road in the burning incense valley was so powerful, but he could not find it. It was really weird.</p>
<p>But tonight&rsquo;s situation is naturally different from that of the previous days. Although the spirit has touched some invisible mechanisms and sent out an alarm. But the noise and fighting in the distance were even more powerful, but the bell was drowned in a moment.</p>
<p>He made a quick decision, swept around and then flew up. It&rsquo;s a headache to lean against the ground to the back of the house in front, but the ring around is still ringing.</p>
<p>At this moment, the monkey Xiaohui, who has been quietly lying on the shoulder of Guili, suddenly called out in a low voice. Guili was stunned and turned to look at Xiaohui on the shoulder.</p>
<p>Reflecting a little moonlight in the night. In front of the ghostly eyes in the shadow, a slight &ldquo;click&rdquo; sound suddenly came from the small gray body. Then the gray mark on its forehead seemed to be dark.</p>
<p>Before the ghost and fierce reaction, it seems that there is something wrong with the little gray, but suddenly turned around. A pair of monkey eyes even gradually lit up a strange and powerful golden light, but behind that golden, there is a faint and strange red.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Squeak, squeak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little grey monkey&rsquo;s hand suddenly pointed to the foundation in a remote corner of the room.</p>
<p>The ghost Li hugs the small ash, looked carefully, whispered: &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter, the small ash?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Squeak, squeak!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Small gray mouth gently called, hand still pointed to that direction, at the same time the eyes of the golden luster slowly faded down.</p>
<p>Ghost Li eyebrow head a wrinkly, immediately nod, put it to shoulder head, body immediately floated past.</p>
<p>The dark corner of the foundation wall, faintly exudes the smell of moss. Under the fierce and careful search, we soon found a small hole about the size of a foot, hidden in the foundation.</p>
<p>His eyes were shining, he reached out his hand, and then he went into the cave as fast as lightning. After a while, a low voice suddenly sounded in the cave, and then he immediately became silent. Almost at the same time, the ringing around him stopped suddenly.</p>
<p>With a smile on the corner of his mouth, he slowly pulled out his hand. A moment later, in the grip of his hand, there was a strange beast. After two struggles, he stopped moving.</p>
<p>The monster has a gray skin and a body length of about three feet, but its body is in a strange &ldquo;bow&rdquo; shape, with a high back, a low head and tail, and a pair of small black bean like eyes set in its head. But the most strange place is that the beast has a strange long nose, which is about half a foot long. It&rsquo;s about a third of its body length. At the front of the nose, there are two big nose holes. It seems that it&rsquo;s similar to the pig in the farmer&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>The ghost Li Zheng for a while, then hummed, whispered: &ldquo;no wonder I said how can not hide in the past, the original has this kind of&rdquo; grey porpoise &ldquo;in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Note 1: the grey porpoise in the chapter of spirit and beast: it has a long nose, big ears, no neck and long tail, ant eating insects and grass roots, and it is nocturnal in the daytime, or the Aardvark.</p>
<p>Note: modern animal? Aardvark: mammal, also called African anteater, has a strong body, about 140 cm long, no incisors and canine teeth, and eats termites with a long tongue like anteater. They live in southern and Central Africa, in hilly or semi grassland areas, and have a high ability of digging soil. They rest in caves during the day and go out for food at night. The courage is very small, the hearing is extremely sensitive, depends on the olfactory foraging, the olfactory sensitivity is more than ten times the dog. (to be continued. )</p>
