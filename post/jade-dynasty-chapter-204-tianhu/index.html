      <p>Xiao Hui&rsquo;s figure disappeared in the dark in an instant. It seemed that he didn&rsquo;t expect that Xiaohui would suddenly make such a strange move. He was surprised. But then he did not get up to chase him. Instead, he slowly raised his head and listened to the faint song coming out of the darkness.</p>
<p>This song is a little familiar, as if I had heard it before?</p>
<p>How many years of time, just like this song, in a hurry.</p>
<p>The gold bottle son walked to the ghost sharp side, carefully looked around, low voice way: &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li didn&rsquo;t answer, but he had a complicated look on his face. The voice of small ash faintly spreads from the distance, it seems that after the &ldquo;squeak&rdquo; call, there is a slightly surprised &ldquo;Yi&rdquo; sound. But soon, Xiaohui was silent again, and the lingering and sorrowful song stopped slowly.</p>
<p>In the dark cave, there is a strange silence around. It seems that something in the dark is watching their figure. The fierce eyes gradually become clear and staring at the darkness ahead. Jin Ping&rsquo;er seemed to be a little uneasy. She felt uncomfortable when she heard the song just now. At the moment, the dark and unknown darkness instinctively made her feel disgusted.</p>
<p>Her subconscious step closer to the ghost, just want to speak, suddenly, the dark depths of the essence of a flash, almost at the same time, GUI Li and Jin Ping er&rsquo;s faces are a change, the difference is, GUI Li is a bit of a consternation, but the gold bottle son seems to be growing a breath.</p>
<p>A faint white light, shining in the dark, flew out quickly and aimed at the light where they were. He stood still and did not move. As expected, the white light passed by his side, but hit the Golden Vase.</p>
<p>Jin Ping&rsquo;er sneered. To her, it seems that the enemy&rsquo;s sudden attack is not in her mind. What she cares more is the unknown silence just now.</p>
<p>The white light came to my eyes in a twinkling of an eye, and the Golden Vase&rsquo;s pretty face was cold, and a light Zha was heard in his mouth. Right hand a turn, suddenly see purple light, in the ghost of the blue halo, with some dreamy flavor of the blue light. He chopped in the air, and accurately cut it on the white light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pa!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The white light was divided into two parts by the Golden Vase, which was the magic weapon of purple awn blade. It flew out to both sides, but it did not fly six feet away.</p>
<p>The two white lights turned out to be bright again. The original reduced half of the body suddenly returned to its original size, which means that two strange white rings appeared at the same time, whistling and flying back. At the same time, the sharp whistling in the air suddenly sounded, which was more than twice as urgent.</p>
<p>Jin Ping&rsquo;er&rsquo;s relaxed and calm face changed. He snorted, and the purple awn blade rose again, but he saw that the two purple awns lit up almost at the same time. The white object that came again was cut in two by her, turned into four, and flew out powerlessly.</p>
<p>However, the strange white light, like the demon spirit, once again after flying out of the distance, it brightened again and quickly returned to its original state. It turned into four white objects of the same size as the original, and shot at the Golden Vase again, which was more urgent.</p>
<p>The Golden Vase&rsquo;s face finally sank. He showed a dignified look and retreated, but there was not much space in this deep cave. Soon the Golden Vase was surrounded by these strange white halos. Hearing the clear voice of the Golden Vase, the purple light was shining. The white light was quickly shot down or flying by the golden bottle. However, these small things were really strange. Almost all of them recovered their vitality after a while and attacked the golden bottle again mercilessly. More and more white light bodies were cut off by the Golden Vase. Slowly, the figure of the Golden Vase was covered up.</p>
<p>From a distance, the white halo is flying and lingering, like a cocoon of light woven slowly, and the Golden Vase will be trapped in it.</p>
<p>Standing on one side, the ghost looked at the Golden Vase Er, who was struggling with the mysterious white light body, but did not do it. However, it can be imagined that the mysterious figure in the dark had not yet appeared. He was so hard to entangle the Golden Vase by virtue of this Taoist method. It can be seen that this person&rsquo;s magic law is very strong, and most of them are the mysterious demons mentioned in the mouth of the evil spirit black tiger Yes.</p>
<p>Seeing that the situation of jinpinger is becoming more and more critical, but somehow, although the white light body is more and more prosperous, the golden bottle still can persist. The white light is more and more urgent, and the momentum is growing. In the huge cave, the white light has already overwhelmed the original soul biting blue light, and the sound of howling in the air is more and more sharp. Seeing the gold bottle son gradually left and right, but can insist on, but no one knows how long she can cope with.</p>
<p>GUI Li suddenly shook his body, but he didn&rsquo;t fly to the Golden Vase, but rushed into the darkness by deceiving himself.</p>
<p>Almost at the same time when his body started, the blue light that had been enveloping him was extinguished in an instant. At the next moment, he was immersed in the darkness and could not see his figure again.</p>
<p>In the distance, there seemed to be a cold hum.</p>
<p>In the familiar darkness, the cold breath wanders around. Far away, there are still those weird light bodies whistling around the Golden Vase, but nearby, it is a strange calm.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the calm ground began to shake violently, and the stone walls of the surrounding caves also began to shake. After a loud noise from the top of the cave, countless small pieces of stones and sand and dust began to fall down slowly, a hazy scene.</p>
<p>In the roar, chaos appeared everywhere, and the darkness seemed to be more and more intense. At this moment, the falling stones suddenly stopped in the air. For a moment, it was almost like time stopped and everything was still. A moment later, the scream rose, and all the stones and dust converged into a huge torrent, rumbling toward the darkness ahead.</p>
<p>The momentum of the torrent was astonishing. All the way up, it was as powerful as mountains and seas. There was nothing to stop it. Suddenly, a white and slender palm was stretched out in the darkness.</p>
<p>The palm index finger and tail finger are erect, the ring finger is half bent, and the thumb and middle finger are gently clasped. The knot is a Buddhist seal, but there is no half of the Buddhist solemn atmosphere. On the contrary, it is more of an indescribable image of tempting demons and forest Demon power.</p>
<p>The invisible Qi congealed from the seal of the hand. In a flash, it seemed that the palm of the hand had been magnified countless times, like a giant palm, which blocked in front of the torrent. At the next moment, when I looked carefully, I found that the palm was still the slender palm, and nothing had changed. However, the once unstoppable torrent was blocked in the air, sending out a huge sound, and countless boulders lost their power. Suddenly, the sand is flying.</p>
<p>The ghostly disappeared figure suddenly flashed out of the dust flying in the sand and stones, and rushed to the palm like electricity.</p>
<p>The white hand had a change. Four fingers stand side by side, half bent, thumb from the middle cross buckle out, down a sink, almost at the same time, the gold bottle in the distance roared. Originally suppressed by those white light body, the purple awn suddenly soared, such as the purple halo burst open, a time of awn prosperity.</p>
<p>But it was not the Golden Vase who broke through the white light suppression. On the contrary, her face was very ugly.</p>
<p>The strange white light, which had been scattered for countless points, scattered and gathered together, and formed a huge wall of white light, which, like a wall of blazing light, rushed from behind to the ghost&rsquo;s shadow at the speed of raging waves.</p>
<p>Light waves have not yet reached the body, the ghost of the breath has been one of the suffocation. The body flying in mid air is also shaking. It can be seen that the power of the light wave is so powerful that if it is hit by it, it is really possible to smash into pieces.</p>
<p>However, the fierce face did not change. It seemed that he did not put the extremely dangerous white waves behind him in his eyes, and his body shape was more and more rapid towards the white palm. However, although he was fast, the light waves were really as fast as thunder and lightning. From far to near, the raging waves had already rushed behind him, and he was about to swallow up his figure.</p>
<p>The Golden Vase is in the distance. I can&rsquo;t help but breathe out.</p>
<p>In the dark, the white hand seemed to tremble a little.</p>
<p>At this time, the ghost sharp left hand suddenly extended backward. The inside of the thumb is close to the palm, the middle finger is half bent, and the three fingers are upright like a mountain, forming an authentic Vajra Dharma seal of Buddhism. Looking at the momentum of his palm pushing out slowly, FA Xiang&rsquo;s bearing is solemn and solemn, which gives people a sense of solemnity. This push. It is the power of Buddha to move mountains with great compassion and great magic power!</p>
<p>There is thunder in the silent place!</p>
<p>Shine in the dark!</p>
<p>In an instant, the palm of the palm is solemn and full of golden light, and the Buddhist scriptures flash by. The wall of light that is like a raging wave suddenly comes and bumps into the palm of this dharma seal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boom</p>
<p>The sound is like a meteor falling to the ground, rumbling away, continuous. In this cave, the extraordinary light rises, and the color is shining. It seems that there are countless colorful eyes opening at the same time, shining and moving.</p>
<p>The white light wall suddenly scattered, meteor like rain.</p>
<p>Only the darkness in front of me, just like before!</p>
<p>He had reached the palm of the hand.</p>
<p>He reached out his hand, his right hand, towards the palm.</p>
<p>The white hand turned over, but did not flinch. The five fingers suddenly became claws, and they flew up in the air. The ghostly right hand flashed in an instant, but instead of the sharp fingertip of a knife, he grasped the wrist of the white hand.</p>
<p>The mysterious figure&rsquo;s palm turned and flashed between the gaps. Instead, he pointed to the root of the ghost&rsquo;s right hand. In a moment, the palms of the two men in the air were as fast as lightning, flashing as fast as light. All the moves were killers who were extremely fierce against the enemy, but they were all dodged by their opponents, and the counterattack came back with a more ferocious counterattack.</p>
<p>However, there was no sound between the two lights. When the two fought to such a point, life and death seemed to be breathing, but their palms never touched.</p>
<p>Until, behind the meteor light rain finally falls completely, the darkness suddenly reappeared, will cover up all the light.</p>
<p>Deep in the dark, a slight sound suddenly rang out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pa&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The voice was clear and deep, faint, not half of the murderous air, but as if we were children together, two hands gently patted sound.</p>
<p>Then, everything is silent.</p>
<p>Got it. That hand.</p>
<p>Hold it. That hand.</p>
<p>Feel, no murderous, no Demon power, but only, soft and gentle.</p>
<p>It seems that suddenly, the sky and the sky are whirling, flying over ten thousand mountains and rivers, blue sea and blue sky, which are all crowded into the arms. Those gentle figures were all around, never leaving.</p>
<p>In that way, a happy life, a happy life, a carefree life</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t this fairyland? Is this life?</p>
<p>Since then drunk, do not wake up, is it better?</p>
<p>Dark, as if also in the temptation of who?</p>
<p>However, he suddenly opened his eyes in the dark, eyes such as blood, roaring up to the sky!</p>
<p>The palm of the hand suddenly shook and drew back. The whole body was full of blue light, and the Soul Eater suddenly appeared on the hand. The dark red blood color on the top of the blood sucking pearl body was all lit up, and the evil spirit was surging. It stabbed into the deepest part of the darkness.</p>
<p>soundless and stirless!</p>
<p>That space suddenly solidified, the whole darkness as if solidified into hard rock. It is indestructible, but it is blunt and has no front. Somehow, it is even the boundary of the strong Demon power. It had no effect on it and was stabbed by the soul biting force.</p>
<p>Finally, someone snorted angrily, and the dark border instantly dispersed, and a figure flew back a Zhang. Let go of the soul of this evil, unstoppable stab.</p>
<p>But in a twinkling of an eye, the ghostly figure actually pasted over like a shadow. The mysterious figure did not disperse all over the body, and did not look flustered. He put out another hand, but now his five fingers were closed, which made him a very delicate fist and hit the ghost fiercely.</p>
<p>However, his face changed slightly, and his body was suddenly smothered, and his eyebrows were slightly wrinkled. All of a sudden, the blood red light in his eyes disappeared, and even the soul swallowing disappeared in his hands.</p>
<p>He opened his mind and raised his hands. Facing the seemingly plain and delicate fist, he slowly rowed down in the air, dignified as a mountain, as light as water. After a moment, the soft light rose between his arms. In the middle of the sky, a Tai Chi pattern appears slowly.</p>
<p>Taiji is Xuanqing.</p>
<p>The fist went up and hit the middle of the Tai Chi pattern, but it was slowly sinking in. The Taiji pattern is concave inward.</p>
<p>His face turned pale, as if his breath had stopped at that moment. But a moment later, the Taiji pattern in the air slowly began to rotate, and the place that was hit by the fist was tight but continuous, on the contrary. As the rotation becomes faster and faster, the huge Demon power contained in the silence is melted by the flexible power of the supreme true dharma of Taoism.</p>
<p>The Taiji pattern spun faster and faster, and the palm of the hand began to shake slowly. The mysterious figure in front of him snorted again, but the voice was slightly painful. Obviously, the power of Taiji Xuanqing to counter setbacks is also very important.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roar!&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a low whistle, the Tai Chi pattern scattered, and the white hand also shrank back into the darkness, as if there was a moment of calm.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, he flew up, and the deep darkness in front of him seemed to be unable to stop him. It seemed that even in the dark, he also had a pair of eyes hidden in his heart and slowly saw the way ahead.</p>
<p>The mysterious figure in the dark is retreating back, fast in shape, but hard to catch up with. In this ancient cave, in the deepest darkness, the two men were flying faster and faster. They turned out to be two lightning waves in the dark, and flashed to the deepest part of the cave.</p>
<p>This flight seems to be endless. The darkness ahead is like a ferocious beast with its teeth and claws, and then falls behind in an instant. There are countless unknown darkness waiting for us in the distance. When the wind blows at your face like a knife, who will you think of in the moment?</p>
<p>The pursuit is like life, never stop, only to later, but do not know lost the way, or forget the original intention!</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how much time has passed and how many roads have been chased. I only know that all the way down, the terrain seems to have gone deep into the ground. But there is silence behind, and the Golden Vase has already been thrown away by the two of them.</p>
<p>The mysterious figure suddenly stopped, turned around in the dark and faced the direction of coming. The ghost immediately found the movement and stopped slowly.</p>
<p>In the dark, the two men were facing each other and did not speak for a moment. A moment later, the blue halo on GUI Li&rsquo;s body lit up again, illuminating the surrounding area, but the darkness in front of him still didn&rsquo;t seem to shine in.</p>
<p>The mysterious figure suddenly said, &ldquo;good magic power!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This sound sounds soft and pleasant, although it is only a light word, but somehow, listening to the ear, but there is a kind of exciting strange feeling.</p>
<p>Under the light blue light, GUI Li was staring at the darkness. His face was calm and his tone was peaceful. He did not look like he had just experienced a thrilling fight with the man in front of him. He said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m flattered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman&rsquo;s voice sneered and said, &ldquo;just in a moment, you can use the magic sect Taoism, Tianyin temple&rsquo;s great Brahma Prajna Dharma and Qingyun gate Taiji Xuanqing Taoism&rsquo;s true dharma to see the opportunity. There is no delay in the transformation. It can be seen that you have completely mastered the Dharma. Besides, the practice of the three sects of Taoism is very important. The practice of Taiji Xuanqing Dao is so powerful that no one else in Qingyun gate, except for the old daoxuan leader, will be superior to you. &quot;</p>
<p>She pauses for a moment and then says word by word, &ldquo;Why are you so diligent in your way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li didn&rsquo;t speak. He just looked at the darkness and suddenly laughed and said slowly, &ldquo;why, my practice is successful. Are you very strange?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the dark shadow, suddenly sounded a few familiar &ldquo;squeak&rdquo; call, a moment later, a figure came out, look carefully, gray hair, long tail, but monkey small gray. I saw it grinning, grabbing its head, bouncing on the ground twice, back to the devil&rsquo;s side, and then ran up to his shoulder, and then sat down with his tail still shaking behind him.</p>
<p>The woman in the dark did not speak and was silent.</p>
<p>Ghost Li looked at that piece of darkness, eyes slowly have feelings, the voice seems to be soft some, smile way: &ldquo;is it you? I didn&rsquo;t expect to meet you here</p>
<p>The woman hiding in the dark suddenly &ldquo;bah&rdquo; and said, &ldquo;do you remember me? Are you not surrounded by such a charming woman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you talking about?&rdquo; he said with a wry smile</p>
<p>The woman was obviously annoyed and said in a cold voice, &ldquo;are you not afraid of the man who is still lying on the cold bed when you do this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li shook his head and said, &ldquo;you misunderstood me. I don&rsquo;t know this place is led by the Lord of the ghost king.&rdquo; He pauses for a moment, light way: &ldquo;I am what person, you are not don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman in the dark snorted, but obviously it didn&rsquo;t sound so angry. She said, &ldquo;how can I know who you are? I only know that men never have good people!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grimly frowned, slightly shook his head, and did not answer with a bitter smile.</p>
<p>In front of that piece of darkness slowly dispersed, in the light of the ghost biting soul blue light, slowly showed a figure. Lying on the ghost&rsquo;s shoulder, the little gray grinned at the slender figure &ldquo;creak, creak, creak&rdquo;, which was very kind.</p>
<p>In the dim light, the woman is charming and gorgeous. Who is it? (to be continued. )</p>
