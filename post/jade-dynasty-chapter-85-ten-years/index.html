      <p>Black clouds hover in the night sky. The sky is dark as if it is pressing against the ground. The rain falling from the sky rolls over the vast land in the wind.</p>
<p>In the wilderness, there is no village before and no village behind. There is only one ancient road extending from afar, and it extends to the distance alone.</p>
<p>In the dark clouds of the night sky, there was a low thunder sound, and the rain between the heaven and the earth gradually increased.</p>
<p>The land is solemn. In addition to the wind and rain, it&rsquo;s dark all around. Only on the edge of the ancient road, alone, a little light is lit, revealing a little light.</p>
<p>This is a wild cottage. The owner&rsquo;s surname is he. He is a middle-aged man in his early forties. He was born in Xiaochi Town, a day&rsquo;s journey from here. In this remote place, beside the ancient road, he built a simple house to provide a place for tourists from south to north to rest and drink tea, so as to earn some hard money.</p>
<p>At the moment, boss he is sitting behind the counter in his shop, listening to the shrill wind and rain outside the house, frowning slightly and sighing softly. In such bad weather, most of the guests will not come again.</p>
<p>His cottage is located between Xiaochi town and kongsang mountain, a big mountain in the West. The ancient road outside the gate has been the road of business and travel since ancient times, and it is also the necessary way to the big city in the East, donghaichang. Therefore, tourists pass by from time to time.</p>
<p>At present, on this stormy night, there are still several guests in this wild shop, sitting silently in the dark and yellow hut, avoiding the miserable wind and rain outside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crackle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The light of the oil lamp in front of boss he made a slight crackle, which awakened the honest middle-aged man from drowsiness. The sound of wind and rain outside the house was tight for a while, sobbing as if choking. It seems that the guests here couldn&rsquo;t leave this night.</p>
<p>He thought so, looking up at the guests in his shop. There are only five tables in the simple hut. At present, there are three tables beside the guests. At the most corner, there is a single man sitting. There is a dark place where the lights are hard to illuminate. The man is sitting there alone. Even his face was dim.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are two tables close to each other. One is an old man with extraordinary bearing and the other is a young girl. The old man has a bamboo pole on the table with a piece of cloth on it. It&rsquo;s written with the words &ldquo;immortal points the way&rdquo;. It seems that he is a monk in the Jianghu.</p>
<p>As for the last table, it was the most crowded business trip. There were four people in total, and the corner behind them was full of goods. At the moment, it seems that there is a young man in the middle cursing the ghost weather.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, stop it.&rdquo; Another of the four looked at the older man and drank him. He turned around and smiled at boss he. He apologized: &ldquo;boss he, it&rsquo;s windy and rainy today, and you&rsquo;ve been staying up late with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Boss he smiles and shakes his head. This business trip often goes up and down this ancient road. He has come to his shop for many times to have a rest, so he is also an acquaintance. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s normal for me to stay up late. But today, from the beginning of the day, there are black clouds. Why are you still on your way, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man was shocked when he heard the words. Then he looked at the other people in his company and said with a wry smile, &ldquo;in fact, how can we not know that the weather is bad today, but it&rsquo;s really difficult to go out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Boss he said &ldquo;ah&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The old man picked up the teacup in front of him, drank all the tea in it, and said: &ldquo;boss he. Now this world is difficult! &quot;</p>
<p>Boss he was surprised and said, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man gave a wry smile and said, &ldquo;from ten years ago. The demon sect, which had disappeared for a long time, suddenly reappeared. It&rsquo;s said that there was a big fight between Qingyun Mountain and the fairies. Since then, instead of being wiped out by the right way, the demon religion has flourished in the past ten years. It has been heard everywhere that they fought against the right way. &quot;</p>
<p>Boss he is silent. The old man sighed and said, &ldquo;we common people can&rsquo;t control what they fight against them. But under this fight, the world is in chaos. Now thieves are rampant, and there are countless people who rob their homes and houses. We live in fear of meeting a strong man every day. We are in a hurry, but we are blocked by the wind and rain. Please boss he.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Boss he shook his head and said, &ldquo;it doesn&rsquo;t matter. You don&rsquo;t have to worry&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he was saying it, a voice came from a corner in the distance and said softly: &ldquo;so, this gentleman thinks that the world is in chaos and thieves are rampant. It&rsquo;s all for the evil cult in your mouth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man was stunned, but he didn&rsquo;t speak. In front of him was the table of the young lady and the young lady. His eyes also looked at them. The young lady had bright eyes, beautiful looks, and shallow dimples at the corners of her mouth, which made her attractive.</p>
<p>At this moment, she suddenly opened her mouth and smiled at the old man of business: &ldquo;this old man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man looked at her and said, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s up, girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young girl said softly: &ldquo;my father, you have thin and many lines, but your face is not broken. Although the Lord has many twists and turns in his life, you are still safe. It&rsquo;s just that there is a small scar in the sixth part of your Tianting. It&rsquo;s across your face, blocking the life line and wealth line. When you&rsquo;re old, maybe there&rsquo;s a big disaster. Now, depending on your age, it&rsquo;s better to say less and have less misfortune. &quot;</p>
<p>All the business travelers changed color together. The old man stood up and stared at the old man and the young man closely. However, both of them had no reaction and were calm. For a while, the old man&rsquo;s face was cloudy and clear. He looked around and finally sat back. He bowed to the girl and said, &ldquo;thank you for your advice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sat back this time, and the shop immediately became quiet. The mysterious man who was just in the corner seemed to be quiet now, and didn&rsquo;t speak any more.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a long night. It&rsquo;s really hard. After a long time, people in the business trip over there began to chat gradually. After all, they talked about the battle of Zhengmo in Qingyun Mountain ten years ago.</p>
<p>These traveling merchants are just ordinary people, who have never been to the scene, but it is said that this thing was born for this. And those high people who are honest are always mysterious, which is the best conversation among the common people.</p>
<p>As he spoke, the voices of several young people grew louder, and others heard him and were attracted to the past.</p>
<p>“…… In a word, the situation of Qingyun gate was in danger at that time. Fortunately, daoxuan, the old immortal, participated in the creation of martial arts. With a little finger, there was thunder and lightning in the sky. It was said that the huge sound could be heard in a hundred miles around the world, which drove the people of the demon sect back! &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fart!&rdquo; Suddenly a light drink. But it was from the old man who was sitting at the same table with the young girl. Everyone was shocked. They looked at him and only listened to the old man: &ldquo;if daoxuan is so powerful. How come in the first World War of Qingyun Mountain, there are so many people dead in Qingyun sect, even two dead in the first place of Qimai sect, and so many other elder disciples are killed and injured. You are the devil of the demon sect for nothing? &quot;</p>
<p>Everyone was dumb.</p>
<p>The girl beside him frowned and whispered, &ldquo;Grandpa, I just told people not to talk too much. Why do you talk so much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man laughed and suddenly became a little complacent on his face, which was originally full of crane bone fairy wind. He whispered: &ldquo;Xiaohuan, don&rsquo;t scare me, I&rsquo;ve already let you see my life style. Although I&rsquo;ve been wandering all my life, I&rsquo;m always lucky. The Lord is safe until he is old. Someone will die. Ha ha, you can do something, you can do something! &quot;</p>
<p>The young girl took a sip of tea, almost choked by his words, coughed twice, glared at the old man, but the old man was complacent and didn&rsquo;t pay any attention.</p>
<p>The old and the young. It&rsquo;s Zhou Xian, a travelling Jianghu monk, and his granddaughter Xiaohuan. Now it&rsquo;s ten years since the last battle of Zhengmo in Qingyun Mountain. Xiaohuan has grown up and is beautiful. It&rsquo;s just that I&rsquo;m still following the immortals on Monday.</p>
<p>At this time, it seems that the addict was hooked up on Monday, and even though it was the first time to meet with others, he pulled the stool, and actually sat in the middle of those business trips, and began to talk about the battle of Qingyun in those days. Xiaohuan was beside him. But it can&rsquo;t be done.</p>
<p>On Monday, immortal&rsquo;s eloquence was excellent. Besides, when he walked around the world, he also relied on his ability to open his mouth, which was lively and lifelike, far surpassing those young people just now. A moment later, even boss he couldn&rsquo;t help coming over. Everyone gathered around him, listening to immortal&rsquo;s vertical and horizontal gaze, talking and laughing, looking back</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hearing the exciting and fierce place, the young people at the same time uttered an exclamation. One of them couldn&rsquo;t help asking, &ldquo;did you know that carefully, old man, you were there at that time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Monday, the immortal was stunned. Then he patted his clothes with his hand and shook his head and sighed: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never been willing to interfere in these fighting and killing things. Let those Qingyun sect kids do it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>All of them were shocked. They were in awe. Unexpectedly, the sound of &ldquo;poof&rdquo; beside them was Xiaohuan&rsquo;s gushing out a mouthful of tea and coughing.</p>
<p>On Monday, the fairy gave her a stare, then turned around and smiled. At this time, there was a young man beside her: &ldquo;old man, what happened to the last disciple of Qingyun sect named Zhang, is it true that Qingyun sect has turned out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Monday, the immortal frowned, and after a moment of silence, he shook his head and said, &ldquo;this one is not clear. There was chaos in the field that day. It seems that Zhang Xiaofan was in a coma and was finally robbed by the people of the demon cult, and then he disappeared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>People around him sighed for a while. In fact, the secret of Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s life experience is a major secret of Qingyun gate and Tianyin temple, which will never be spread out. However, there were a large number of people present when the secret was revealed that day, especially the people from the demon sect. So after a long time, the world spread slowly. Just what the immortal said at the moment on Monday, it seemed as if he had witnessed it in the jade palace of Tongtian peak of Qingyun Mountain that day.</p>
<p>Boss he sighed and said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how the boy is now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is he now&hellip;&rdquo; Suddenly, the voice of the mysterious man sitting in the corner began to ring, with a faint vicissitudes.</p>
<p>On Monday, Xian turned to look at the man sitting in the shadow and said, &ldquo;why, brother, do you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man was silent for a moment and said slowly: &ldquo;I naturally know, but even if you have seen him before, you must not recognize him now&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan frowned and said, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s wrong with him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man didn&rsquo;t speak any more, just hid his figure in the dark.</p>
<p>The wind and rain outside the house spread all over the sky and the ground, as if it was a little sad</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Kongsang mountain, wanbat ancient cave.</p>
<p>Eight hundred years ago, heixin, the elder of the demon sect, created the heyday of the blood refining hall. He ordered the demon sect to frighten the world. But now the younger generation disciples are unworthy. It&rsquo;s desolate and desolate here.</p>
<p>But hidden in the depths of wanbat Grottoes near the dead soul pit, now it has been occupied by countless unexpected foreign enemies.</p>
<p>On the edge of the boulder with three characters of &ldquo;dead soul yuan&rdquo; carved in ancient seal script, the last disciples of the blood refining hall gather here, lean against the boulder, and then step back, that is, the abyss of the dead spirit.</p>
<p>And their numbers. There are less than ten people left, including Nian Da, Liu Hao, wild dog Taoist and so on. They are all injured and scared. On the ground in front of them. Ten corpses, many times as many as their men in black, lay on the ground, encircling them, all with a skeleton embroidered on their chest.</p>
<p>The old man breathed deeply and calmed himself.</p>
<p>At the beginning of his speech, he suddenly found that his voice was hoarse: &ldquo;Zhu, you ghost King religious friends, our blood refining hall is just a small faction of the holy religion, and we never dare to offend the ghost King sect. No, I don&rsquo;t know why the elder ghost king did this to us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hum!&rdquo; A cold hum came from countless people in black. A skull on the chest was embroidered with gold. The man in black, who was totally different from others, came out and looked like a leader. He said lightly: &ldquo;eldest brother of the year. Now, the situation in the holy religion is very obvious. The Lord of the ghost king has sent books to you several times. But you are still like the grass on the wall. Deal with us today and worship under the door of the longevity Hall tomorrow. Don&rsquo;t you pay attention to the Lord of the ghost King in your heart? &quot;</p>
<p>The old man lost his color. He knew that the internal struggle led by the four major sects was becoming more and more fierce among the saints. All the small sects were attached to each other. From time to time, he heard the rumors of being killed by the mysterious figures. But now the emperor of ghosts suddenly entered. Their hard-working strength, which they have been working hard for many years in the blood refining hall, is almost destroyed by them at one stroke, and the situation in front of them is quite obvious.</p>
<p>Sure enough. The man in black sneered and said: &ldquo;elder brother, I&rsquo;ll tell you once more. Now the leader of the ghost king is brilliant and can unify the holy religion soon. His old man only wants to accept you and return you to the blood refining hall. Don&rsquo;t be disrespectful. &quot;</p>
<p>After that. His voice was full of threats.</p>
<p>The elder brother&rsquo;s forehead is full of sweat beads. Although the situation is clear, his small blood refining hall can&rsquo;t rival the ghost King clan in any way, but the foundation industry handed down by his ancestors will be destroyed in his own hands?</p>
<p>This determination is really bad!</p>
<p>The man in black saw the old man&rsquo;s hesitation, and suddenly said: &ldquo;old man, I advise you to say that you are facing me now. It&rsquo;s lucky for you, but you know who is in charge of the attack on kongsang mountain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the elder brother was shaking, the man in black sneered and said: &ldquo;you guessed it, right? It&rsquo;s the vice leader of the ghost King clan. If he comes, your end will be&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>He said half, and suddenly someone coughed twice. The man in black changed his face. He seemed to think of something, and his face turned white, as if even he had a deep fear of the name.</p>
<p>At this time, suddenly came a strong smell of blood, do not know where to come from, but suddenly filled with the whole huge space.</p>
<p>All the people in black of the ghost King clan straightened their bodies at once. The man in black, who had just led the group, was also slightly pale. Looking carefully, we could see that his eyes were slightly twitching.</p>
<p>Who is it that makes him so afraid?</p>
<p>Step by step, gradually sounded, as if from the abyss of the endless dark depths, slowly out.</p>
<p>One step, one bloodstain!</p>
<p>All the people in black were suddenly like the tide. They separated to both sides to make way for a passage.</p>
<p>The faint blue light, with reddish blood light, ripples gently in the dark and moves forward slowly.</p>
<p>The faces of the people in the blood refining hall were all pale and bloodless.</p>
<p>Ten years ago, there was no such person as GUI Li in the ghost King clan. However, it is said in the religion that after the war of blood between the demons ten years ago, the leader of the ghost King clan received a righteous traitor and regarded him as himself, and even handed down the second volume of the Holy Scripture &ldquo;the book of heaven&rdquo; which fell into the hands of the ghost King clan.</p>
<p>In addition to the miraculous progress of Taoism, the spirit of the evil spirit has become so powerful that people in the demon sect are shocked.</p>
<p>In recent years, the internal fighting in the demon sect has become increasingly fierce. However, Guili, a simple disciple of Qingyun sect, has become the No. 1 General of Guiwang sect. He led the disciples of Guiwang sect to kill and kill countless people. He didn&rsquo;t know how many people&rsquo;s blood had been absorbed by a &ldquo;soul eating stick&rdquo; in his hand. In addition, the ghost King&rsquo;s other eyes, he soon became a figure of more than ten thousand people under one person in Guiwang sect.</p>
<p>But this man, ten years ago, these people in the blood refining hall had met.</p>
<p>The wild dog Taoist in the crowd looked at him. The man who gradually appeared in the dark, with such a strong smell of blood, seemed to emanate from the depths of his body.</p>
<p>There are countless people standing in the field, but there is no sound at all.</p>
<p>His appearance. Still as if in those days, there is no change, the appearance between the eyebrows, all vividly. It&rsquo;s just the heart of a wild dog, but it starts to jump all the time, as if it&rsquo;s not a person at all, but a fierce beast standing in front of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said the first sentence slowly. The voice is steady and sharp, echoing in this place: &ldquo;do you want to go down or not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Countless people stood behind him, but no one approached him.</p>
<p>All the people in the blood refining hall looked at each other. The eldest brother was sweating and didn&rsquo;t even feel the wound on his body. But at this time, a strange cry came out: &ldquo;you go to die!&rdquo;</p>
<p>All of them lost their color. For a moment, they were on the ground beside the ghost. Suddenly, a knife light burst out and stabbed him in the stomach. However, the assassin&rsquo;s face was wild and dazed. His feet had been cut off and his blood flowed.</p>
<p>It seems that he is a disciple of the blood refining hall. He is seriously injured, and finally loses his sense in fear and pain. He screams and stabs at the ghost. Just a moment later, the dark blue light mingled with the bloody red light came from the fierce right hand and enveloped the man.</p>
<p>The smell of blood in the air. A little bit heavier.</p>
<p>The withered body fell to the side powerlessly, and the faces of the people in the blood refining hall turned white again. Some young disciples began to shiver, but the red light gradually appeared in the eyes of GUI Li. Again slowly said: &ldquo;you, do you want to go down?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the ugly black soul eating stick in his hand (fire stick ）Gradually, it also lights up.</p>
<p>Behind him, all the people in black seemed to inhale together and take a step at the same time.</p>
<p>The incomparable and terrifying breath flooded in and overwhelmed all the people in the blood refining hall.</p>
<p>Suddenly. &ldquo;No, no, I, I am down!&rdquo; burst out a cry from the blood refining hall</p>
<p>With this sound, a young disciple ran out, left the people in the blood refining hall, rushed to the ghost King clan, but subconsciously left the location where the ghost Li was.</p>
<p>As soon as he opened his head, he immediately began to react. Everyone in the blood refining hall looked at me and me. From time to time, someone came out and sighed with a long sigh. He knew that the situation was over. He said with a cruel smile, &ldquo;just, just!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he said this, he came out from the crowd. The crowd followed him and slowly walked to the front of GUI Li. He took out a black iron plate with a palm. There was a black heart engraved on it. He gave it to Gui Li with both hands. He said with a cruel smile, &ldquo;at this time, the &lsquo;black heart order&rsquo; of blood refining hall is over. The foundation of blood refining hall has been eight hundred years, and now it&rsquo;s over&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment, suddenly a big drink, but the tone is slightly trembling fear of the voice, from behind them. All of them were shocked and turned to look at it. However, they saw that there was still a man standing in front of the huge stone just now, who did not follow them.</p>
<p>Wild dog Taoist!</p>
<p>The wild dog Taoist stared at the eldest brother and gasped heavily, but he said loudly: &ldquo;eldest brother, when you led me to the blood refining hall, we made a solemn oath together before the heixin ancestral statue. This life will never change. How can you do this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man&rsquo;s face flashed with shame. He lowered his head and said in a low voice, &ldquo;wild dog, the situation is better than people. You don&rsquo;t want to die. Come quickly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wild dog Taoist priest, under numerous double eyes, especially the eyes with red and horrible light in front of him, stabbed him in the heart, making his cold hair stand up, even his feet tremble slightly because of his fear.</p>
<p>However, he was shaking his head slowly: &ldquo;no, boss, no, you can do whatever you want me to do, but I can&rsquo;t rebel against the blood refining hall!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at the front, blankly and empty, as if everything was destroyed, and said in a low way: &ldquo;I grew up like a monster, and everyone despised me, so my own father and mother abandoned me. I was raised by wild dogs and suffered a lot of humiliation. Only after I entered the blood refining hall, it was my turn to bully others and raise my eyebrows. At that time, I swore in front of my grandparents that I would definitely follow the blood refining hall in this life, and I would not regret to die&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>Everyone was shocked. The eldest brother noticed that his face was gradually gloomy and his heart was anxious. He didn&rsquo;t expect that the wild dog was always bullying and afraid of death, but now it suddenly changed.</p>
<p>But it can&rsquo;t be because the wild dog is alone, but he doesn&rsquo;t even care about his own life. Then he said ruthlessly, &ldquo;OK, you are great, then you can support the blood refining hall alone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Say, hand a throw, the black heart that makes to throw in the hand past, wild dog subconsciously catches, but the body shakes violently immediately immediately, gasp for breath.</p>
<p>In, the eldest brother and others all disappeared among the black clothes people of the ghost King clan. Only the wild dog was left standing alone under the shining Boulder, facing countless black clothes people, and the one standing not far in front of him was the legendary blood eating devil!</p>
<p>The quiet and fierce eyes fell on the face of the wild dog.</p>
<p>The wild dog felt that he had almost seen the evil ghost. If it was not for the boulder behind him, he would not know if he could stand.</p>
<p>However, in this extreme fear, he said in a low trembling voice, &ldquo;kill me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said, he clenched the black heart in his hand, closed his eyes, and the cold iron card seemed to melt into his body, waiting for the coming of destruction and death together! (to be continued. )</p>
