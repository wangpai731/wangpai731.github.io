      <p>Qingyun Mountain, Tongtian peak.</p>
<p>On the Yuqing hall, the solemn and solemn scene of the past seems to have changed on this day. The disorderly steps ring ceaselessly inside and outside the Yuqing hall, and the suppressed but flustered whispers seem to spread here like waves of water. In the distance, there seems to be a noisy voice, which in the past can not be imagined that it would happen openly on the Tongtian peak. At the moment, the noise seems to be getting louder and louder, and I am approaching the Yuqing hall.</p>
<p>Yuqing hall is very high, standing on the sea of clouds. Even if you cross the Hongqiao bridge and go up from the stone steps beside the blue water pool, you have to walk for a while, but most of the sound is half past the stone steps.</p>
<p>After hearing the news, Xiao Yicai, the first disciple of tongtianfeng&rsquo;s eldest gate, quickly walked into Yuqing hall surrounded by several younger martial brothers. Somehow, his handsome face showed a little tired, and he didn&rsquo;t know what it was, which could make the young leader of Qingyun gate with profound Taoism so much trouble.</p>
<p>However, although her face was tired, Xiao Yicai walked into the hall. She was still calm, frowned and said in a slight anger: &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter? I don&rsquo;t think the trouble is enough. Who has the courage to make a noise here? &quot;</p>
<p>Next to them, several young disciples guarding the gate of the hall came to me in a hurry. Immortal daoxuan has been closed for a long time since the war with the beast God, and his temper has become strangely strange. Most of the affairs of the Tianfeng sect have been managed by this great elder martial brother. In the eyes of all the young disciples, Xiao Yicai is in awe.</p>
<p>But at the moment, the noise is still getting louder and louder, but most of the young disciples have a strange look on their faces. One of them approaches Xiao Yicai and lowers his voice and says, &ldquo;elder martial brother Xiao, it&rsquo;s martial uncle Su from dazhufeng.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai was stunned and said, &ldquo;Su Ru, Su Shi Shu?&rdquo;</p>
<p>People around nodded.</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai was surprised and said, &ldquo;what did she do here? Since she came, why didn&rsquo;t she report it? She made such a noise&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before he finished speaking, he only heard the noise outside the Yuqing hall. It seems that someone finally lost his patience. A clear whistle came from afar, like the sound of a Phoenix, and rose leisurely.</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai&rsquo;s face changed. He quickly walked to the gate of Yuqing hall and said, &ldquo;no, let&rsquo;s go Junior brother Cao, go to the backyard immediately.</p>
<p>Please come over and dissuade him. We are all younger generation. We are not good at talking. Go</p>
<p>Next to the two young disciples quickly nodded, turned around and ran to the back hall of Yuqing hall.</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai strode to the gate of Yuqing hall. He was about to get to the gate. Suddenly, the sound of Qingxiao was heard in a hurry and made a sharp sound.</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai&rsquo;s face turned white, and his figure flashed away to the door. At the same time, he raised his breath and cried in a deep voice: &ldquo;Uncle su. If we have something to say, don&rsquo;t&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>Before finishing a sentence, I just heard &ldquo;ouch, ouch&hellip;&rdquo; The sound suddenly came, Xiao Yicai&rsquo;s body was smothered and stifled.</p>
<p>At the huge gate of Yuqing hall, under the gentle and blue sky, more than a dozen people fell in from the outside of the hall. No one could stand on their feet. They turned around and fell to the ground after a while.</p>
<p>There was an uproar in the Yuqing hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey</p>
<p>A cold hum. I saw a slender figure, which appeared on the gate of Yuqing hall. It was Su Ru.</p>
<p>This sound, instantly shocked the whole audience. On the huge Yuqing hall, there was no sound. All the people&rsquo;s eyes were focused on the woman who suddenly became powerful.</p>
<p>The black and shiny hair is in a bun, and there is a red jade eye-catching golden phoenix spreading its wings hairpin. The Phoenix&rsquo;s mouth is holding a three minute glazed jade bell. Shake it gently. Two willow eyebrows, cold with gorgeous, Qingli more beautiful; red lips closed, cheeks like snow, one eye clear incomparable, more with three points of anger. The loose clothes she always wore disappeared. At the moment, Su Ru was dressed in plain clothes. She was less charming and more warm. At the same time, she was holding a dark green fairy sword with sheath. Although there was a scabbard outside, the sword spirit was invisible and diffuse. It made people feel that this fairy sword had spirit, and seemed to want to dance wildly.</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai&rsquo;s eyelids continued to jump a few jumps, subconscious feeling behind some hair cold.</p>
<p>Su Ru&rsquo;s face was like frost, and her eyes were cold. She swept all the people in Yuqing hall. At that glance, although she was beautiful, no one dared to look at her.</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai looked out of the corner of his eyes at the young disciples who were slowly climbing up from the ground. Although they were blue and blue, they suffered only minor external injuries, not to mention injuries. It was rare to see blood.</p>
<p>At that time, he was quite calm. It seems that although the martial uncle Su Ru suddenly became angry, he still cared about his family&rsquo;s feelings and didn&rsquo;t attack him hard. Otherwise, according to the saying that &ldquo;that woman is really powerful&rdquo; in the past, these martial brothers would have to suffer even more.</p>
<p>But Rao is so, Xiao Yicai suddenly in front of a cool, but Su Ru&rsquo;s eyes finally fell on his body.</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai chuckled and stepped forward. He bowed his hand and took a peek at Su Ru&rsquo;s dark green sword and said, &ldquo;this Why is uncle Su so free today? He has come to Tongtian peak. &quot;</p>
<p>Su Ru looked at Xiao Yicai coldly and snorted coldly. She didn&rsquo;t pay any attention to Xiao Yicai&rsquo;s question. She didn&rsquo;t mean to pay back Xiao Yicai&rsquo;s salute at all. She was still very proud and stood there with a pretty face and said in a cold voice, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t talk nonsense. Call me daoxuan out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as this was said, there was a commotion among nearly 100 disciples of Tongtian peak in Yuqing hall.</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai&rsquo;s face changed. He was shocked for a long time and said, &ldquo;Uncle Su, is something wrong? My master, he has been closed all the time! By the way, what about Uncle Tian! Why didn&rsquo;t he come with you? &quot;</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t mention that Tian was not easy. As soon as he said this, Su Ru&rsquo;s face suddenly changed, and her expression changed. Among them, three parts were sad and three parts were anxious, and the third part was angry and a little cold and murderous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roar!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly, a low roar like the roar of wild animals came out of the Yuqing hall. All of them were surprised. Then they found that the strange sound came from Su Ru&rsquo;s strange dark green fairy sword. Su Ru&rsquo;s fingers were pale when holding the sword, and the slender knuckles were bloodless because of the force. It seemed that something was sensed. The light of the sword was bright, and now it was more prosperous. There was a roar of wild animals.</p>
<p>Such a powerful and powerful sword, held in Su Ru&rsquo;s gentle and gentle woman&rsquo;s hand, did not feel at all out of place. On the contrary, it was like a tiger&rsquo;s wings and increased the intention of killing.</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai subconsciously stepped back. The scalp is numb, but I don&rsquo;t know where I said the wrong thing. But this is my elder martial uncle, and her husband Tian Buyi is the head of the big bamboo peak in Qingyun family, which is not easy to offend.</p>
<p>In principle.</p>
<p>Su Ru has made a big mistake in breaking into the Yuqing Palace this time. However, judging from Su Ru&rsquo;s appearance, there is no trace of fear. It is clear that Su Ru is not only making trouble, but also making big things.</p>
<p>In the strange and low roar of the dark green fairy sword, Su Ru said to Xiao Yicai in a cold voice: &ldquo;call daoxuan out. I&rsquo;ll ask him well. What&rsquo;s the matter with him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai was shocked. Suddenly raised his head, all the people in the Yuqing hall were silent.</p>
<p>At this time, suddenly, there was a rush of footsteps in the back hall. An old voice came from afar and said, &ldquo;sister Su, is it not easy that something happened to younger martial brother?&rdquo;? If we have something to say, we are all under the Qingyun gate. You must not mess around</p>
<p>With the sound of the words, I saw a number of old people in the back hall. First, two people, one black, one white. He had a white beard at the same time. But the old voice was from the older man with darker hair. As for the elder with white beard, it was when Zhang Xiaofan was still at the time of seven pulse martial arts on Qingyun Mountain. Elder fan, who was a martial arts judge.</p>
<p>In the past ten years, Qingyun gate has experienced two great wars and catastrophes. The number of people who died and injured in the last generation was not large.</p>
<p>Su Ru looked at the old men coming over and frowned. A cold hum, but still no half convergence meaning. The old man with white beard, Mr. Fan, looked at Su Ru and coughed, but murmured in a low voice.</p>
<p>The old man with black hair looked around and saw a dozen young disciples with black hair. He frowned. He wanted to talk to Su Ru, but Su Ru said coldly to the elder fan: &ldquo;elder martial brother fan, are you scolding me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elder fan&rsquo;s face turned red with her eyes, but he immediately shook his head and said, &ldquo;where, younger martial sister Su, I still have younger martial brother who is not easy with you. It&rsquo;s been years of friendship. I admire you too late. How can I scold you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Old fan frowned and looked back.</p>
<p>Mr. Fan chuckled and made a gesture, saying, &ldquo;elder martial brother Yang, you say, you say&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man with black hair, who was called elder martial brother Yang, turned around and said to Su Ru, &ldquo;sister Su, please calm down. What&rsquo;s going on? Tell me.</p>
<p>You are also a cautious and gentle person on weekdays. How can you do it today This is something that even the younger martial brother may not dare to do? &quot;</p>
<p>Su Ru&rsquo;s face was still cold, but the light of the fairy sword on her hand was slowly weakened, and she no longer gave out the low and strange roar. People beside her quietly breathed a sigh of relief. Just now, Su Ru stood there holding the immortal sword, which was so powerful that ordinary Qingyun disciples were really frightened.</p>
<p>Su Ru looked at the elder Yang, moved the corners of her mouth and said with a sneer: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not easy to dare to do something. I may not dare to do it. I want to see daoxuan. You ask him to come out. &quot;</p>
<p>Several elders looked at each other and looked at each other for a moment. Elder Yang coughed and said, &ldquo;younger martial sister Su, the leader&rsquo;s elder martial brother has been closed for many days. It&rsquo;s really inconvenient for him to come out. You&rsquo;d better talk about what makes you so angry! What&rsquo;s the matter with Mr. Tian? Why is he not with you</p>
<p>Su Ru Liu eyebrow a congealed, Qingli in more three points of fierce anger, a loud voice: &ldquo;he did not ask you to buckle the sky peak!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as this was said, elder brother Yang, elder fan and all the people up and down in Tongtian peak changed their faces. Elder Yang said, &ldquo;younger martial sister Su, you can&rsquo;t talk about it. Younger martial brother Tian is the first of the seven veins of Qingyun. In addition to the leader of daoxuan, he and senior brother Zeng are the most popular. What&rsquo;s more, they are all the same disciples. How could there be any detention No way</p>
<p>Su Ru sneered and said coldly, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t think we don&rsquo;t know what happened to senior brother daoxuan. It&rsquo;s because we know what happened to him. It&rsquo;s because he knows what&rsquo;s going on. He&rsquo;s willing to take big risks and go up the mountain to advise him. But this time, even up to now, there is no news. If I don&rsquo;t come to ask for people from you, who will I go to? &quot;</p>
<p>Elder Yang was astonished. Elder fan, standing on one side, suddenly turned to Xiao Yi and said, &ldquo;nephew Xiao, it&rsquo;s not easy to be the head of the field in dazhufeng. Have you ever been to Tongtian peak recently</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai shook his head blankly and said, &ldquo;no, I&rsquo;ve always been in charge of the affairs of tongtianfeng, but in the past few months. Uncle Tian didn&rsquo;t report that he would come to Tongtian peak! &quot;</p>
<p>Su Ru took a look at elder fan and said coldly, &ldquo;what do you think he&rsquo;s going to do? Do you think he&rsquo;s here to worship the mountain and wait for tea slowly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fan Changlao&rsquo;s face was red and he didn&rsquo;t speak. Elder Yang has already said to Xiao Yi: &ldquo;nephew Xiao, since this is the case, you should go to the ancestral hall of Houshan to ask the headmaster and elder martial brother. If possible, you&rsquo;d better invite him here. Everyone will understand when you speak to him face to face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai hesitated for a moment, nodded and said, &ldquo;OK, I&rsquo;ll go now.&rdquo; Say it. Turn around, walk quickly to the back hall, and go at a brisk pace.</p>
<p>After seeing Xiao Yicai disappear, elder Yang turned around and said with a smile, &ldquo;younger martial sister Su, I also know that your husband and wife are deeply in love, so I can&rsquo;t help being upset. However, it&rsquo;s too much for you to rush into the Yuqing palace so rashly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru was silent for a moment, and said faintly, &ldquo;elder martial brother Yang, you are right. If it&rsquo;s really not easy later, it&rsquo;s no big deal, but I suspect that there is a dark ghost. Su Ru should accept the Green Cloud Gate method to deal with it&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>Yang elder waved his hand and said with a smile, &ldquo;look at you. I didn&rsquo;t mean that&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>Su Ru&rsquo;s words turned, but she was determined to cut off: &ldquo;but if it&rsquo;s really not easy, what&rsquo;s going on in the Tongtian peak, elder martial brother Yang,&rdquo; her clear and transparent eyes were shining, and her words were like her stirring feelings and determination. There is no room for wavering and turning back. &ldquo;In 2000 years, there will be an unworthy disciple Su Ru of Qingyun gate. He wants to give a speech to the ancestors and the famous leader and elder martial brother on the Tongtian peak of Qingyun Mountain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a soft drink, she waved her hand like a knife, breaking through the wind. The dark green sword light suddenly flourished, and the sound of piercing the air rose from the ground. Then there was a dull sound and the flying dust swayed. People felt that their feet were shaking slightly, which was like an earthquake. When the dust stopped a little, Su Ru&rsquo;s dark green sword had been inserted into the hard stone slab in the center of Yuqing hall. There was no crack around the inserted land.</p>
<p>In the dark, although the dark green fairy sword that was inserted on the ground left Su Ru&rsquo;s palm, the power of the sword was even stronger, like a beast licking blood, and it gave a low roar.</p>
<p>The elder martial brother Yang looked at the dark green fairy sword that was inserted in front of him and Su Ru, and said with a wry smile, &ldquo;sister Su, this is not so far. Why do you still take out the ink snow which has been sealed for more than 100 years?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru sneered and said, &ldquo;elder martial brother Yang, you know, it was not easy for me to seal the ink snow in those years. Because he was there, it was sealed. I didn&rsquo;t care. But if something goes wrong with him, I will ask the leader&rsquo;s elder brother and his old man for advice with this ink snow. &quot;</p>
<p>Yang elder shook his head with a bitter smile and said, &ldquo;you I thought you and younger martial brother Tian have been married for many years, and you have already changed your temper Just, just, anyway, I can&rsquo;t persuade you. We&rsquo;d better sit down and wait for Xiao Yicai to invite the headmaster and elder martial brother here! &quot;</p>
<p>Su Ru&rsquo;s face was expressionless, but she snorted, and slowly walked to one side with Yang elder and sat down.</p>
<p>In Yuqing hall, the atmosphere gradually eased down. Elder Yang lowered his voice over there and whispered something to Su Ru. He wanted to comfort Su Ru not to worry too much. The other elders either stood behind the Yang elder or sat down. Only the old fan slowly walked to the side of the gate of Yuqing hall, far away from nasuru. As for the other young disciples, their status was not enough. With Su Ru&rsquo;s anger, one stood farther than the other.</p>
<p>Among the elders of Tongtian peak, this elder fan is the most easygoing and humorous person. Although Taoism is inevitably lagging behind the elder elders, he is the most popular among young disciples. Whether he teaches his own disciples or not, as well as other martial nephews, he is very close to him.</p>
<p>At this time, people saw elder fan standing alone. Many of the younger generation&rsquo;s disciples quietly leaned over. Some of them had just been thrown in by Su Ru and were disciples of elder fan&rsquo;s family.</p>
<p>Elder fan looked at the disciples and shook his head. There was a little disciple beside him who could not help but ask in a low voice, &ldquo;master, why is that uncle Su so fierce! On weekdays, she is very gentle. How could she be so fierce? &quot;</p>
<p>The white bearded fan gave the apprentice a look, gave a &ldquo;Hey&rdquo; sound, blew the beard below, and said, &ldquo;how long have you guys been in Qingyun gate? What do you know? When that woman was fierce, she couldn&rsquo;t do anything! &quot;</p>
<p>The young disciples who came around slowly. One by one, listening attentively, someone whispered, &ldquo;ah! I don&rsquo;t see it! Uncle Su is so It must have been a natural beauty in those days, wasn&rsquo;t it? &quot;</p>
<p>Elder fan laughs and takes a peek at Su Ru and Yang elder. Seeing that they were talking, they obviously didn&rsquo;t notice the young disciple&rsquo;s side. At the moment, they got bolder and said, &ldquo;speaking of it, she was also the most famous female disciple of Qingyun gate. It&rsquo;s like Er, &ldquo;he nodded, his face suddenly showed a mysterious smile, and lowered his voice:&rdquo; it&rsquo;s like Lu Xueqi in xiaozhufeng now. &quot;</p>
<p>All the disciples around Qi Qi uttered a &ldquo;ah&rdquo; voice. They all suddenly understood and nodded, indicating that they had understood the meaning of elder fan.</p>
<p>In response, fan was somewhat proud and said, &ldquo;in fact, although she was a good Taoist at the beginning. But there are others who are better than her, such as senior brother daoxuan and senior brother Wan, who are rare talents in a thousand years. Naturally, they are better than her. It&rsquo;s just that people see her young and beautiful, and she has a master, master Zhenyu, who is the backer. No one dares to provoke her, so she dares to make trouble everywhere. I still remember that when she was alone, she made the Qingyun gate fly, and the female tiger Shuiyue was almost as fierce as her Well. Stinky boy, why do you hit me? Be honest, I haven&rsquo;t finished yet</p>
<p>Elder fan was full of enthusiasm. Then he continued: &ldquo;at the beginning of that water moon, well, how did you look like that? Oh, I know. You don&rsquo;t understand who I&rsquo;m talking about? ha-ha. As a matter of fact, the master Shuiyue in xiaozhufeng is Su Ru&rsquo;s elder martial sister. She was fierce at that time, but like Su Ru, she was famous in Qingyun gate. Hey, stinky boy, why do you always pull me? I&rsquo;ll tell you, how can I say that I&rsquo;m also your master. Don&rsquo;t be so unruly Why, where did I just say? &quot;</p>
<p>“…… Well, I remember. It&rsquo;s water moon. Although Su Ru was shrewd and daring to do anything at that time, she seems to have changed her personality since she married the field of dazhufeng. That&rsquo;s what you saw in the past. In fact, we old fellows also think it&rsquo;s strange, but it&rsquo;s still a good thing! But as like as two peas, that&rsquo;s not the same. How fierce the year was, how fierce it is now. Even the disciple she taught, love your favorite Lu Xueqi, almost the same as her. Damn it</p>
<p>Elder fan suddenly turned around and said angrily, &ldquo;Stinky boy, why do you always pull me? I haven&rsquo;t been beaten for a long time. My skin itches, isn&rsquo;t it&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He suddenly broke his voice, slightly opened his mouth, and saw a circle of young disciples standing aside, silent and motionless. Outside the gate of Yuqing hall, master Shuiyue is indifferent, standing there looking at elder fan coldly. Beside her, Wen Min is also looking at elder fan, but she is angry.</p>
<p>Elder fan&rsquo;s forehead was covered with sweat, and his old face turned red. He stepped back a few steps. He was extremely embarrassed and laughed bitterly.</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue comes in slowly, but he never looks at elder fan any more. Wen Min is quite unwilling and stares at him severely.</p>
<p>Among these Qingyun elders, elder fan has always been famous for his words. This time, he was caught on the spot, and the scene was extremely embarrassing.</p>
<p>However, Su Ru and elder Yang don&rsquo;t know what happened here. When Su Ru saw master Shuiyue, she was surprised. She stood up and said, &ldquo;elder martial sister, how did you come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue frowned slightly, looked around and said, &ldquo;I have to ask you first! If you are not in dazhufeng, why did a person run to the Tongtian peak? If something happens, it is not easy for him to run. How did you come? &quot;</p>
<p>Su Ru moved her mouth and looked at her elder martial sister. Suddenly, her heart was sour and her eyes were red.</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue was stunned, and a little uneasiness flashed in his heart. He looked at the Yang elder beside him. He shook his head and grinned bitterly, but he didn&rsquo;t know how to talk about it for a while. Master Shuiyue felt a little anxious in her heart. She and Su Ru grew up together. The friendship between them was extraordinary. They were really like sisters. This time, Su Ru felt as if something had happened. She was even more worried. Her eyes flashed, and she saw Su Ru&rsquo;s dark green sword, Mo Xue, in the ground. The surprise was extraordinary.</p>
<p>Just as she was about to ask Su Ru at the exit, a flurry of footsteps broke out in the back hall. Xiao Yicai swept in like a whirlwind, but her face was full of rare panic on him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something&rsquo;s wrong, something&rsquo;s wrong!&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everyone in Yuqing hall was shocked. Su Ru felt like a thunderclap in her head. She whirled and whirled. The worry that had been swirling in her heart almost broke away, but she felt that she was almost fainted when she saw the darkness in front of her eyes.</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue helped Su Ru, who was very pale, turned to Xiao Yicai and said, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter, please tell me clearly!&rdquo; (to be continued. )</p>
