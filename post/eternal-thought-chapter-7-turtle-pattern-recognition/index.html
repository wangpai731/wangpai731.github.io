<p>In the following days, when Zhang daphou and others looked at Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s thatched cottage, they all kept an eye on them. Since Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s cultivation broke through to the second layer of condensate gas and went out to talk to himself, his practice in the house continued.</p>
<p>In the house, Bai Xiaochun wiped off the sweat from her forehead, bared her body, endured severe pain, and worked hard to put out the action of the third picture.</p>
<p>The Qi pulse in his body is no longer a stream, but is about to become a river. He swam in his body. Every week he swam, his body would emit the sound of clicking. His originally round body has completely lost weight, even a circle thinner than when he first came to the kitchen.</p>
<p>However, there were bursts of strength, which seemed to be contained in his body. With the insistence of practice, his thin body seemed to be beating slightly, and even listening carefully, the thump of his heart could be heard reverberating around the house.</p>
<p>More and more spiritual pressure, constantly condensing in his body, this strong feeling every moment, let Bai Xiaochun more power, until a few days later, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s whole body suddenly stabbed, the pain is more intense than before, too much, let him have to give up.</p>
<p>Breathing heavily, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s eyes were covered with blood. He had a strong feeling that his body seemed to be unable to hold on. Although he would constantly absorb the spiritual power from the surrounding world during his practice, he obviously could not keep up with the consumption of his body. The food in the fire kitchen also depends on luck, not every day.</p>
<p>After all, most people practice this skill once a few days. Even if they are diligent, they can only do it once a day at most. He works all day and night, not to mention Zhang daphou and others. Even the inner disciples of the sect will be shocked if they know about it.</p>
<p>However, Bai Xiaochun felt that it was not safe to practice at this level. He was always keen on safety. So he took out the grain of LingMi which he had hidden, looked at it in his hand, and cooked it in an ordinary pot. As the aura was released, he immediately swallowed it in a big gulp without hesitation.</p>
<p>LingMi melts at the entrance, forming a strong aura, which is too many times more than ordinary LingMi. It is not a level of majestic force at all. Bai Xiaochun quickly cultivates himself and presents the appearance of the third picture to adjust his breathing.</p>
<p>In this way, half a month later, one night, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s body suddenly shook. When he opened his eyes, he was surprised to find that his cultivation had broken through the second layer of condensate gas and became the third layer of condensate gas.</p>
<p>This change immediately made Bai Xiaochun ecstatic, his eyes showed excitement, laughing, he looked at his body, the body of Qi has completely transformed from the stream into a river.</p>
<p>The river swam fast in his body, and the speed was much faster than before. Even if he had only one thought, the aura in his body would swim to any position in his body with his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three layers of condensate! The spirit rice of refining once is really extraordinary! &quot; Bai Xiaochun stood up and licked her lips. She wanted to make a few more grains of spiritual rice. However, she felt that the meridians in her body were expanding. She thought of the introduction in the bamboo book and knew that it was necessary for her body to adapt to it. She could not continue to practice for a short time.</p>
<p>This just suppressed the previous idea, walked around the room, a complacent look, can quickly step, eyes along the window to see the outside door, although it is late at night, with the help of the moonlight can see the big tree on the path outside the fire stove house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Xu Baocai&rsquo;s wooden sword seems to be unusual. Even if it reaches the third condensate layer, it&rsquo;s still a little unsafe!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun frowned, pondered for a moment, then looked at the colorful wooden sword beside her eyes and the pot in the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you can do it twice, it might be safer.&rdquo; Thinking of this, he immediately made a decision, went out of the room and took some wood from the kitchen.</p>
<p>After the preparation, in the night of this day, Bai Xiaochun stood by the mysterious pot, lit the wood fire, saw a grain bright, and threw the wooden sword into the pot.</p>
<p>But this time, after waiting for a long time, Bai Xiaochun frowned and looked at the patterns on the turtle shaped pot, and the wood fire under it had turned into ashes. She pondered over Shaoqing and went out to look for some holy wood. However, after several times, no matter how the flame burned, there was no change in the wooden sword.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are all wood of the same color. Is it because the temperature is not enough and needs higher heat Two color fire When Bai Xiaochun thought of this, she walked out of the door and came back again with a piece of purple wood in her hand. There was not much left in the wood fire kitchen. Bai Xiaochun only found one.</p>
<p>Put it under the pot to ignite, immediately there is a flame, the flame is composed of two colors, it is a much higher two color fire!</p>
<p>As soon as the two color fire appeared, the second pattern on the turtle shaped pot was bright for a moment, but the two color fire was rapidly dim, as if all the fire power had been drained at once. After a short time, when the two-color fire was completely burned to ashes, the second holy grain on the turtle pattern pot was already lit up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s done!&rdquo; When Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s eyes lit up, he quickly put the wooden sword in the pot. Suddenly, the silver light flashed suddenly, and the time was much longer than before.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be dark, but suddenly, the silver light suddenly rises and goes straight to Bai Xiaochun. The change comes suddenly. Bai Xiaochun has no time to react. He is shocked to find that he can&rsquo;t stop it. He sees the cold in his body with a violent pumping.</p>
<p>His whole face was pale at once, and when his eyes were blurred, he seemed to have something in his body, which was sucked out and integrated into the turtle shaped pot.</p>
<p>Until then, the silver light dissipated, and a wooden sword, which was sharper than ever, and even made people feel the pain in their eyes, suddenly appeared in the pot.</p>
<p>Although the sword looks colorful and shabby, the wood patterns inside it have changed. If you wipe off the paint, you can clearly see that the lines are scattered with stars. This sword has been completely and fundamentally changed.</p>
<p>Almost at the same time when the wooden sword appeared, there was a thunderclap in the sky on the South Bank of lingxizong. It seemed that there was a roar from the sky, which shocked many monks of Lingxi sect. Fortunately, the thunder came and went quickly.</p>
<p>In the reverberation of thunder, the second Silver Stripe appeared on the body of the wooden sword, which flashed several times in succession. Then it was dim and disappeared under the mottled color of smearing.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun didn&rsquo;t care to look at the wooden sword. He stepped back a few steps with a gloomy face. His body was on the verge of falling. It took a long time for him to recover. The feeling of the moment just now made him feel a little frightened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s taken from me&hellip;&rdquo; After carefully looking at the wall, his eyes gradually fell on the wooden mirror.</p>
<p>In the mirror, in the tip of his forehead, there was an extra gray hair. Although his appearance did not change, he felt as if he was one year old.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lifespan Bai Xiaochun murmured in a lost heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s less is my life span. I I&hellip; &quot; He wanted to cry without tears. He came to practice for the purpose of long life. But now he has not got it. Instead, he has lost one year&rsquo;s life. This is a great blow to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Losing money I didn&rsquo;t expect that Bai Xiaochun had been safe for a small part of her life, and I even had a slip up time&hellip; &quot; He sat there blankly, laughing bitterly. After calming down, he looked up at the turtle shaped pot, but his eyes slowly showed strange meaning. He had a faint feeling that after Shou yuan was sucked away, he had some connection with the turtle pattern pot, as if he could control it.</p>
<p>His right hand raised to the pot.</p>
<p>At once, the black light of the turtle shaped pot flashed, and it shrank in an instant, and went straight to Bai Xiaochun. In a blink of an eye, Bai Xiaochun suddenly stood up and stepped back. He looked down at his finger and at the empty stove.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This This&hellip; &quot; His right hand pointed to the ground again, the black light was shining, and with a bang, the pot appeared again.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun tried several times in a row. Her expression was cloudy and sunny, with both joy and melancholy. Finally, she sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Although at the moment, it can be earned in the body, but at the cost of one year&rsquo;s Shouyuan, I still lose money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the afternoon of the next day, Bai Xiaochun was trying to figure out what way to make up for his absorbed Shouyuan. He suddenly looked up and felt that there were seven or eight figures galloping outside the fire stove.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun didn&rsquo;t notice the first layer of condensate, but now he felt the seven or eight figures in the three layers of condensate. The first one was Xu Baocai.</p>
<p>At the same time, Xu Baocai&rsquo;s voice, with resentment, suddenly came.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bai Xiaochun, you are guarded by your senior brother, and I have Xu Baocai. It&rsquo;s time to end the grudges between you and me today.&rdquo;</p>
