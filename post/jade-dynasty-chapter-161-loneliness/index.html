      <p>The low hissing and roaring came from all directions. On the plain 200 miles away from Qingyun Mountain, more and more strange beasts gathered in southern Xinjiang, and some of them kept roaring to the sky. Among the herds, there are six or seven monsters, which are especially huge, far more than the surrounding ordinary beasts. They are standing in the herd and roaring, and the surrounding demons seem to be particularly afraid of them.</p>
<p>Misty rain, the sky more and more thick clouds, gradually began in the edge of the sky in the clouds, some light flash, a moment later, finally there is a rumble of thunder.</p>
<p>Dark world, unspeakable vicissitudes of life.</p>
<p>Lightning flashed across the sky, reflecting a strong shadow. The huge bird demon who had just returned from Heyang city fell from the sky. Relying on the light of the lightning, the monsters all saw two people in the claws of the big birds. For a time, hundreds of demon monsters from far and near roared loudly, which made people feel terrible.</p>
<p>The huge wings fluttered in the wind and rain, and the big birds circled over the herd for a while, and suddenly their claws were loosened. The two figures fell down like stones. They just saw that although the figures were rolling in the air, they did not struggle like dancing, but were very rigid. Most of them were on the way. These two poor people could not stand the giant birds and beasts The power of the demon is born and died under these two giant claws.</p>
<p>The roar of monsters on the ground rose in an instant, and the sound of gnashing teeth rose one after another. In a moment, at least dozens of beasts leaped forward. In the bleak rain, only a few blood colors could be seen, and finally disappeared.</p>
<p>The giant bird in the sky screamed twice and flew again for a moment. Then, as if discovering something, it fell from the sky and fell into the depths of the dense herds. When its huge body was about to land, suddenly its broad wings spread out again and gave out a &ldquo;whoop&rdquo;. The strong wind blew down several beasts nearby and called out.</p>
<p>A strong wind came. The giant bird floated over the herd. Along the way, countless monsters bowed their heads in awe and dodged. In the meantime, they met several giant monsters who were equally powerful, and seemed to stare at each other. Show no weakness. The bird flies all the way, and its body sometimes goes up and down, or flies over the top of the beast demon, or flies over the branches of trees, and sometimes meets a monster from a big, terrible to an incredible giant. It also passed directly under the statue and monster.</p>
<p>Wind and rain, sky thunder and lightning, giant bird in the wind and rain like duckweed floating, finally, it issued a scream again, fell from the air.</p>
<p>It was the deepest part of the animal demon group. Among the black and strange beasts, an oil cloth umbrella with several peach blossoms painted on the blue umbrella was highlighted in the sky under the light of lightning. Floating in the wind and rain.</p>
<p>The giant bird fell down beside the umbrella, which made it clear that there was a wooden stick attached to the handle of the umbrella, which was lengthened, and then inserted between a rock. Under the umbrella, a boy in a gorgeous silk coat was sitting, holding a jug and a glass in his hand, pouring and drinking himself. Next to the boy, a sleepy beast, Taotie, was lying on the rock. At the moment, he saw the giant bird fall. Taotie just opened his eyes slightly, took a look, and then closed them.</p>
<p>The surrounding herds roared uneasily, and the giant bird fell to the ground. With two squeaks in his mouth and a wave of his huge wings, he immediately fanned out more than a dozen monsters in the original place. For a moment, he roared and roared one after another, but no one dared to challenge him. The giant bird looked around, looking proud. It seemed that they did not pay any attention to these monsters, and then turned to face the young man, and for a moment, it seemed very respectful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quack, quack, quack&hellip;&rdquo; Facing the boy under the umbrella, the giant bird croaked for a while. The boy seemed to understand the bird language and nodded slowly. After a few more calls, the giant bird stood still. A moment later, it stretched out its beak and cleaned its feathers. The rain covered the whole body. After several times of cleaning, it quickly gave up its efforts, looked up at the night sky, and slowly shrunk its head into its wings to avoid the wind and rain.</p>
<p>As the rain grew heavier and heavier, the boy drank one cup after another, never stopping. He only occasionally lost his mind, staring at the distance for a moment, then lowered his head in silence and drank again. But no matter how much alcohol he drank, his face never had the slightest alcohol.</p>
<p>Finally, the pot of wine drunk, in the wind and rain from the hands of the slip, fell on the ground full of mud. The young man stood up slowly, and the monsters around him stirred with fear. But in the young man&rsquo;s eyes, the countless beasts seemed to be as if they had nothing in common, and they did not pay any attention to them. His eyes, at the moment, only silently looking at the sky, dark clouds, wind and rain Xiaoxiao.</p>
<p>Taotie gave a low cry and stood up beside him.</p>
<p>In silence, the young man turned around and patted Taotie&rsquo;s head. For a long time, he said, &ldquo;do you feel lonely, Taotie?&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taotie roared, but no one knew what it meant. The boy looked up at the sky for a long time without saying a word.</p>
<p>On the top of Qingyun Mountain and Tongtian peak, it has been raining for a night, and it is still raining continuously. The people of the right path, headed by the three main sects of the right path, are gathering in the Yuqing hall to discuss, and the voices of debate are heard from time to time. At the top of the list, the three great masters of Qingyun gate, master Puhong of Tianyin temple and Yun Yilan of burning incense valley are talking about something in a low voice. They are all browned and obviously worried about the monster catastrophe in front of them.</p>
<p>Suddenly, there was a rush of footsteps outside the Yuqing hall. All of them were stunned. Xiao Yicai, the eldest disciple of Qingyun gate, quickly walked into Yuqing hall. After a pause, he nodded to all the right people around him. Then he walked straight to Taoist immortal and whispered in his ear.</p>
<p>Everyone looked at them one after another, and they could see that Xiao Yicai&rsquo;s face was grim and extraordinary. With his words, immortal daoxuan&rsquo;s serious face had no smile, and the rest was solemn. Gradually, everyone&rsquo;s hearts were raised, and they felt that the inexplicable pressure was gradually coming to this place.</p>
<p>After hearing Xiao Yicai&rsquo;s words, Taoist immortal looked at him and asked him in a low voice. Xiao Yicai nodded silently with a positive look. Immortal daoxuan took a breath and nodded. Xiao Yicai turned around and stood behind him.</p>
<p>Next to him, master Pu Hong and Yun Yilan also looked at him. Master Pu Hong said, &ldquo;Amitabha, master daoxuan. Is there any news about the monster? &quot;</p>
<p>Daoxuan real man nodded and stood up. There was a stir in the crowd of people on the right path.</p>
<p>The Taoist priest calmed down, and the expression on his face gradually showed firmness. Lang Sheng said: &ldquo;you Taoist friends, just received the news that a large group of animal demons have appeared on the wild land 200 miles away from Qingyun Mountain, and will come soon, and at the foot of the mountain, outside Heyang city. We&rsquo;ve also begun to find traces of monsters</p>
<p>As soon as it was said, people were in a commotion. All kinds of expressions such as panic, fear, anger, sigh and so on appeared on the faces of the people. The catastrophe which had been on the minds of the people for many days finally came to him.</p>
<p>Seeing the people&rsquo;s expressions, immortal daoxuan pressed his hands, and the noise of the crowd gradually dropped. When the surrounding area became quiet, the immortal daoxuan said in a loud voice: &ldquo;ladies and gentlemen. Now the catastrophe is just around the corner, and the fate of the world depends on our fight with these demons. All of you here are virtuous masters of justice. You and I should do our best to fight for the world&rsquo;s living beings. As the so-called heavenly mind is free, there must be no way out of heaven. Although these monsters are rampant for a while, they must not last long. &quot;</p>
<p>In the crowd. There was silence for a while, and some people said, &ldquo;what the real man said is true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, there are so many experts here. We will work hard together. It&rsquo;s not hard to beat the monster! &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly, exactly&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a while, they seemed to be inspired, and the people&rsquo;s expressions began to be relaxed and happy. After all, there are still three major sects and these experts here. Go further. On this Qingyun Mountain, there is the legendary invincible and invincible Zhuxian sword array. Looking at the confident expression of real daoxuan, what is there to worry about?</p>
<p>Under the gaze of countless people in the right path, immortal daoxuan slowly smiles and says a few words to the public. Then he goes back to the inner hall of Yuqing hall with master Puhong, Yun Yilan and Xiao Yicai.</p>
<p>Once out of sight, Taoist immortal&rsquo;s face suddenly becomes heavy, while master Pu Hong and Yun Yilan&rsquo;s faces are not relaxed. When they walk into the quiet room of the inner hall, Xiao Yi follows and closes the door.</p>
<p>Taoist immortal turned to Xiao Yicai and said, &ldquo;Yi Cai, tell me the details.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai nodded: &ldquo;yes. I visited Heyang city at the foot of the mountain, and I got rewards one day after another. Especially at the head of Heyang City, I saw a huge bird demon appear with my own eyes. The appearance was very similar to the &ldquo;Shura bird&rdquo;, one of the thirteen monsters in the legend of animal demons these days. &quot;</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan and the other two experts looked at each other, and both looked heavy. Xiao Yi then said, &ldquo;in addition, the rest of the students who were secretly exploring the surrounding land boundary reported that they had found some traces of animal spirits. Among them, the most dense place was 200 li away from the Southwest. However, the disciples had been waiting for a long time, but there was no news of them 。”</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai said this, his face gradually darkened, daoxuan immortal calm face, and next to the cloud Yi Lan sighed, Pu Hong people chanted in a low voice.</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan pondered for a moment, nodded, and said to Xiao Yicai, &ldquo;it seems that you can&rsquo;t be wrong. The monster is indeed coming. Yicai,&rdquo; he looked at his favorite disciple and said, &ldquo;you can go down the mountain again, and inform all the disciples who have been investigating everywhere to shrink back. The range should be within 100 Li around Qingyun Mountain. Remember to tell them not to cross the boundary without permission Don&rsquo;t start with the beast demon in order to avoid accidents. &quot;</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai nodded, as if thinking of something, and said: &ldquo;master, what about those people in Heyang city?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan was silent for a moment, and then turned to see Master Puhong and Yun Yilan. Master Puhong bowed his head and said, &ldquo;so far, everything is headed by the real leader. Please make a decision.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan expressed his thanks with a slight jaw. Then he pondered for a moment and said to Xiao Yicai: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s really difficult, but Heyang city is too dangerous. Now we can&rsquo;t go down the mountain to guard the people. You immediately go down the mountain to Heyang City, lead all the Qingyun disciples in Heyang City, and tell the people in Heyang city to go north as soon as possible, at least across Qingyun Mountain range. At the moment, the biggest target of those monsters is the right path on Qingyun Mountain, not the common people. It may be safe for a while. &quot;</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai was stunned for a moment, but looking at the expressionless face of daoxuan, he still nodded quietly and said in a low voice: &ldquo;yes, that disciple is going now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Daoxuan was really humane: &ldquo;one more thing, you should inform Qingyun as soon as possible, and come to Tongtian peak immediately. I want to see them immediately. There&rsquo;s something to discuss. &quot;</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai nodded his head and said, &ldquo;I will go right away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taoist immortal sighed and said, &ldquo;be careful all the way, go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai nodded. Back out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Magic moon cave?&rdquo; Monday fairy was startled, frowned, a rare dignified expression appeared on his face, hesitated for a moment, and said, &ldquo;what do you want to do with this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve always been well-informed,&rdquo; he said. Suddenly, I was very interested in this cave, so I asked you, how much do you know about the magic moon cave? &quot;</p>
<p>Monday immortal saw a fierce look, only see his face calm, can&rsquo;t see what he is thinking, a profound look.</p>
<p>At this time, they were still in Heyang city. However, the atmosphere in Heyang city at the moment was quite different due to the arrival of the huge strange bird and beast last night. Their original worries finally turned into reality. Under the pressure of panic, more people were on the verge of collapse. From time to time, we can see people shouting nonsense in the street. They act like crazy people.</p>
<p>Zhou Yixian took back his eyes, turned his mind in his heart and said slowly, &ldquo;you, you don&rsquo;t want to do something inexplicable?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The eyes of Xiao Huan and the wild dog Taoist both fell on GUI Li&rsquo;s body. The grey on his shoulder seemed to feel something. He grinned at them and made a grimace. What do you think I can do</p>
<p>On Monday, Xianqian said with a smile, &ldquo;actually, I don&rsquo;t know much about the magic moon cave. This cave was not famous at all, just because the green leaf master was in it thousands of years ago. At the same time, the ancient sword of killing immortals appeared, which is famous all over the world, but it has been only used as the collection place of ancient sword Zhuxian, and only master Qingyun can enter it. So the reputation is fading away. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, is there anything else</p>
<p>Monday fairy hesitated for a moment and said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what you want to do, but you&rsquo;d better not go there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ghost Li eyebrow head a pick, way: &ldquo;why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Monday fairy sighed. He said: &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t know who you are now. The magic moon cave is a place of green clouds. In case you go to Qingyun Mountain and be found Don&rsquo;t forget that there are thousands of people in the right way on Qingyun Mountain at the moment. If your identity is exposed, it will be difficult for you to escape as a bird. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my business. You can tell me something about the magic moon cave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Monday fairy shook his head and muttered in a low voice: &ldquo;the young people nowadays are really impatient ok It is said that on the night of the bright moon, there are strange stones in front of the cave, which are colorful and dreamlike. But what&rsquo;s more important is that there are natural differences in the cave. After entering the cave, if you fall into a dream, those who do not have a firm mind will fall into it and cannot extricate themselves, and their practice will be destroyed. &quot;</p>
<p>Ghost Li Zheng for a while, way: &ldquo;what, still have this kind of thing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The immortal on Monday snorted, looked up and down, and said, &ldquo;I advise you not to be wishful thinking. If you enter the magic moon cave, there is only one way to die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost sharp sneer a, way: &ldquo;how to see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Monday, the fairy said, &ldquo;I know you are not satisfied, and you are tough, but I will tell you the truth.&rdquo; his face slowly became solemn. Unexpectedly, he had a momentum of not being angry and powerful. He said in a deep voice: &ldquo;the so-called determined mind is not how you are. In my opinion, you have been in ups and downs all your life, and your heart is full of sorrow. If you fall into a dreamland, I&rsquo;m afraid It&rsquo;s hard to get rid of it. &quot;</p>
<p>He hesitated for a moment, but after pondering for a moment, he still said: &ldquo;what&rsquo;s more, your magic weapon is a very fierce and evil thing, and your blood essence and soul have long been combined with the Demon power of blood sucking beads. These monsters are more harmful and unhelpful to you in those illusions, so I advise you to die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ghost Li looked at Monday immortal, as if he had found this man for the first time. He looked at him calmly. After a long time, GUI Li didn&rsquo;t look at him and turned around slowly.</p>
<p>At this moment, there was another commotion in Heyang city. A large number of Qingyun disciples appeared on the streets at the head of the city and said something loudly to the people on the street. Zhou Yixian and others were stunned and rushed to listen carefully. However, Qingyun disciple announced that the beast demon was coming. Heyang city was already very unsafe. People had to cross the Qingyun mountains at least.</p>
<p>On Monday, the immortal&rsquo;s face was bitter. He shook his head and sighed more than once. He turned to Xiao Huan and other people: &ldquo;Oh, this is bad. I don&rsquo;t know Why, where&rsquo;s that guy</p>
<p>Xiaohuan and the wild dog Taoist are both stunned. They turn around in a hurry, but they can see nothing behind them. The crowd is crowded, but where can we see the ghostly figure.</p>
<p>The sea of people is vast and the voice is noisy. Zhou Xian, standing in the crowd, frowns and shakes his head. The little ring beside him is silent and silent. He just looks at the distance in silence. After a long time, he sighs softly. In the voice, there seems to be some sadness. (to be continued. )</p>
