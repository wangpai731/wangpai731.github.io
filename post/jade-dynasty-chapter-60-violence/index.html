      <p>In the match with the wild dog Taoist, an eminent monk of Tianyin temple, who is a man of profound Taoism, used a golden wooden fish magic weapon, and chased the wild dog Taoist as if he were alive in the air. The wild dog Taoist was extremely embarrassed. The strange fanged magic weapon in his hand was no longer shining. I&rsquo;m afraid it was broken by the other side.</p>
<p>I saw the sound of wooden fish in the field, the golden wooden fish in the air shaking their heads and tail, chasing after the wild dog Taoist. The wild dog Taoist breathed heavily and ran awkwardly, looking funny. In the right way, people laugh loudly, and Tian ling&rsquo;er is even more a girl&rsquo;s heart, &ldquo;giggle&rdquo; laughs incessantly. Zhang Xiaofan stood by her side and secretly looked at her elder martial sister, but Tian linger smiled like a flower, and two shallow dimples appeared on her snow like face, which is really how touching it is. He was intoxicated for a while, hoping that this moment would be forever.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Zhang Xiaofan heard a roar in the field, and looked at it. But that year, the eldest brother came out of the crowd to rescue him. His road trip is far above the wild dog. The power of red devil&rsquo;s eyes is not small. The eminent monk of Tianyin temple also put up his smile and deal with it carefully.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan looks at it for a few times and suddenly finds a strange thing. In the demon sect, when the wild dog Taoist was trapped, except for the ugly faces of the eldest brother, Liu Hao and others, most of the others were busy and lucky. Later, I saw that the wild dog Taoist couldn&rsquo;t support him, and only the eldest brother came to the rescue, but the others were all hands tied to watch. Zhang Xiaofan was surprised to think that the people in the demon sect can&rsquo;t see each other in common sense. Isn&rsquo;t there any factional struggle in their own?</p>
<p>In fact, Zhang Xiaofan guessed almost the same. Elder brother Nian and wild dog belong to the blood refining Hall of the demon sect, which was famous under the black heart elder eight hundred years ago. But now it has declined for a long time and has been excluded by the mainstream factions of the demon sect. At this time, I saw the wild dog making a fool of himself. Instead of helping, the people of the demon sect with a large number of people laughed at the joke.</p>
<p>After all, the eldest brother of Nian is the leader of a school. He has a lot of Taoism. Within a few rounds, he was able to resist the attack of the monk of Tianyin temple.</p>
<p>The wild dog Taoist got a gap and came back. Scold: &ldquo;thief monk, almost hurt your grandpa!&rdquo; In the swearing, he went back and attacked the eldest brother with two.</p>
<p>There was an uproar among the righteous. One after another, some people scolded: &ldquo;demon cult demon, shameless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the voice of criticism, Zhang Xiaofan suddenly felt that the wind was blowing around him and he was scared. But Tian ling&rsquo;er is unwilling to be lonely and rushes out.</p>
<p>Amber and Zhuling, surrounded by her graceful figure, soared in the sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shameless devil, fight more and fight less. Master Fazhong, I will help you!&rdquo; Tian ling&rsquo;er said.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan then knew that the name of the monk in the field was called FA Zhong. It seemed that they were in the same generation as FA Xiang FA Shan, but they looked much older than the two of them.</p>
<p>I saw Tian ling&rsquo;er jump out in the middle of the field, shouting a Buddha&rsquo;s name and saying: &ldquo;thank you very much, benefactor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>France said a right hand move. The golden wooden fish in the air rushed to Nian Da immediately, caught him, took him aside, and Tian ling&rsquo;er took it to the wild dog Taoist. As soon as the eye catches a look, it can be seen that tianling&rsquo;er is young in Dharma, and she has left the wild dog with obvious bad behavior to her.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan watched Tian ling&rsquo;er connect with the wild dog. He was worried and wanted to go out to help him. Suddenly, his shoulder was pulled by someone. At first sight, it was song Daren, the elder martial brother. Just listen to song Daren. In a low voice, &ldquo;little younger martial brother, the devil cult demons are shameless. If we want to win more, we don&rsquo;t want to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan immediately woke up. Nodded and held back. Inadvertently, I saw Tian and his wife were all in a state of calm and calm. Then I thought, with Shifu and Shiniang here, what can elder martial sister ling&rsquo;er do? I&rsquo;m really worried.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan blushed. He glanced around and saw that all the people around him seemed to be looking at the scene. No one noticed his gaffe. Song Daren turned around and looked at the fighting method in the middle of the air as if nothing had happened, which relieved him. At this time, he suddenly felt that Youdao&rsquo;s eyes fell on him from the side, but when he turned around to look, he saw that it was where the elder martial sisters of xiaozhufeng were, and Lu Xueqi was also in it, but no one looked here.</p>
<p>At this time, in the middle of the sky, Tian ling&rsquo;er used amber and Zhu Ling at will. In the glow of the sun, the Taoist wild dog is dazed. He only feels that there are many Zhu Ling from up to down, left and right. He is trapped in the middle and can&rsquo;t rush out and break them. Later, he is afraid that he will be wrapped into zongzi by the Zhu Ling.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not easy for Tian to see his daughter&rsquo;s face. His face can&rsquo;t help but show his contentment. Many people in the right way also praise him. Tian ling&rsquo;er has a beautiful appearance. Compared with the dog look of the wild dog Taoist, he has a difference of 18000 Li. Later, not only the righteous people applauded, but also some people in the demon sect laughed loudly.</p>
<p>The wild dog is angry with his ears.</p>
<p>Although he didn&rsquo;t have a deep cultivation, he was far away from Tian ling&rsquo;er&rsquo;s experience in fighting enemies. When his eyes turned and he glanced at Tian ling&rsquo;er for a few times, he saw that most of the girl was a new comer. He immediately shouted, &ldquo;Stinky girl, you look pretty. I can&rsquo;t imagine that you have an affair with the old monk!&rdquo;</p>
<p>All of a sudden, the people in the audience calmed down. After a while, all of the people in the right path swore loudly. The people in the demon sect laughed. Some of the obscene people laughed loudly and said, &ldquo;yes, yes, I can&rsquo;t see it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian ling&rsquo;er was angry and impatient, and said angrily, &ldquo;you, what are you talking about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wild dog halberd pointed out that the dog&rsquo;s face was &ldquo;dignified&rdquo;, and he said in a way of acting for the heaven: &ldquo;bah, if you are not good with this old monk, how can you jump out to help him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even in Dharma, Tian ling&rsquo;er&rsquo;s face turned pale. She knew that it was the plan of wild dog&rsquo;s fierce general. However, her 18-year-old girl&rsquo;s family was suddenly called this huge insult in front of the public. When she was angry, she showed her flaws in the magic weapon.</p>
<p>The wild dog aimed at the opportunity and rushed out of the encirclement of amber and Zhu Ling. Only then did he see his figure come out, and only heard a roar. The sky was full of red silk. If this man was in the middle, he was afraid that he would not be crushed?</p>
<p>The wild dog can&rsquo;t help but spit out his old tongue and say, &ldquo;what a cruel girl!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian ling&rsquo;er was so angry that her snow-white face turned red, let alone talkative. Amber and Zhu Ling rose in the wind like electricity, and rushed to the wild dog Taoist again.</p>
<p>The wild dog was frightened and ran with his head in his arms. People in the demon sect saw him escape and hissed all around. Suddenly, they didn&rsquo;t know who had the head. &ldquo;Huhu&rdquo; sound, unexpectedly one by one to fly away, there is no one to help.</p>
<p>In a twinkling of an eye, only one member of the blood refining hall was left. Elder brother Nian looked there, his face was gloomy. Hate in my heart, but I finally know that this is not a place to stay. At that time, the red devil&rsquo;s eyes glowed with red light. He pushed the Dharma back several Zhangs, pulled himself out, and used his hands to move people. And run away.</p>
<p>Tian ling&rsquo;er wants to chase again. He only hears his father Tian not easy to say: &ldquo;ling&rsquo;er, don&rsquo;t chase.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian ling&rsquo;er stops abruptly, his face is still red. It&rsquo;s hard to turn his head to Tian and say: &ldquo;Dad, listen to that monster&rsquo;s nonsense&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian didn&rsquo;t smile easily, but Su Ru stepped forward and pulled her down. She said with a smile, &ldquo;those demons can do anything bad.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, we should not be able to hear some rude words. &quot;</p>
<p>At this time, most of the people in the right way echoed and said: &ldquo;exactly, exactly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Tian doesn&rsquo;t have to worry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian ling&rsquo;er is so angry. In the right way, when people see that the demons and demons of the demon sect have been scattered, they are mostly scattered. These days, they often fight with the people of the demon sect like this. When they are scattered, they fight again.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan is trying to talk to elder martial sister ling&rsquo;er, but suddenly he gets hit on the shoulder and looks back. I was stunned and then I was very happy. I saw Lin Jingyu standing behind me, his face happy, long time no see. He was dressed in white, with a dragon cutting sword on his back. His eyebrows were starry and handsome. He was really outstanding.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s first time to see this playmate who grew up together since he was a kid. He wanders in the Jianghu these days. At the critical moment of life and death, Lin Jingyu&rsquo;s figure has never passed in my mind.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu looked at him for a long time. His face was full of joy and excitement. Suddenly, he rushed up to hold Zhang Xiaofan in his arms and refused to let him go. It took him a long time to let go. Zhang Xiaofan was in the same mood, and saw Lin Jingyu&rsquo;s eyes seem to have some tears flashing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Xiaofan!&rdquo; As soon as Lin Jingyu opened his mouth, he choked up a bit. The hand holding his shoulder was more than hard, which almost hurt Zhang Xiaofan.</p>
<p>But Zhang Xiaofan didn&rsquo;t care about it at all. After seeing Lin Jingyu, it seemed that only this brother could understand the fear and despair he had experienced on the edge of life and death these days. Only in front of this brother can he really relax himself.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu held him tightly and whispered, &ldquo;Xiao Fan, I, I thought I would never see you again&hellip;&rdquo; At this point, he was so excited that his lips trembled a little that he couldn&rsquo;t speak any more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me, me too.&rdquo; Zhang Xiaofan looked at him the same, but they suddenly looked at each other with a smile and breathed out a long breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good to come back. We will wipe out the demon cult and revenge together in the future!&rdquo; Lin Jingyu grabbed Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s shoulder and said with a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Zhang Xiaofan nods heavily.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu&rsquo;s mood gradually calmed down and his face calmed down a lot. Looking at Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s dusty face now, he suddenly felt a little gloomy between his eyes and eyebrows and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad for you and hate myself when I hear that you have come down the mountain. I can&rsquo;t imagine that in the past few years, Shifu has wasted so much hope of me that his achievements are not as good as yours. &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was shocked and shook his head and said: &ldquo;Jingyu, you can&rsquo;t say that. Who doesn&rsquo;t know that you are ten times more qualified than me. If I met you in the last big test, I must have lost. I&rsquo;m just lucky. &quot;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu breathed out a breath, smiled happily, and said: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s also true that I will try my best to practice in the future. If I don&rsquo;t believe it, I can&rsquo;t beat you, but you can&rsquo;t relax.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan laughed and nodded.</p>
<p>The two of them are here to reminisce about the past, where Tian ling&rsquo;er is still babbling to his mother, and Su Ru is comforting her with a smile.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan talked with Lin Jingyu for a while, looked at the school, grabbed Lin&rsquo;s hand and said, &ldquo;come on, I&rsquo;ll introduce you to my Shifu senior brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t want Lin Jingyu to hum a, low voice way: &ldquo;on your short wax gourd master, forget it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan glared at him and said, &ldquo;no nonsense.&rdquo; He was pulled over with his words.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu has no choice but to follow him. When he got close, Zhang Xiaofan was about to talk. Suddenly, he saw the place where Tian ling&rsquo;er and Su Ru were talking. He didn&rsquo;t know when more people came out. Yu shulinfeng was handsome and handsome. It was Qi Hao.</p>
<p>Qi Hao said a few words to Tian ling&rsquo;er in a warm voice. Tian ling&rsquo;er smiled at the moment, but there was still a trace of vitality. She smiled like a flower. She grabbed Qi Hao&rsquo;s hand in front of everyone and came to Tian not easy here.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan only felt a &ldquo;buzz&rdquo; in his mind. There was a blank space. In a moment, there was no more scene. Only elder martial sister took Qi Hao&rsquo;s hand and came over. He heard Lin Jingyu&rsquo;s smile. In a low voice, he said: &ldquo;originally, your little white gourd master refused to let elder martial brother Qihao and elder martial sister Tian go together, but elder martial brother Qi begged for master. Master always valued elder martial brother Qi and asked the head immortal to say something. Your master had to agree. hey. You see, they&rsquo;re all in the open now&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu suddenly stops talking, opens his mouth slightly, and looks at Zhang Xiaofan.</p>
<p>At the moment, Zhang Xiaofan seems to have suddenly changed his personality. He just feels that he is going to burn his body clean with a raging fire in his heart.</p>
<p>He just felt that he was being roasted alive in the nine hell fire. In front of him, the man and the most beloved beautiful woman were pulling their hands together. Come here.</p>
<p>The fire stick, which had been hidden in his waist, also made a familiar cold feeling and swam all over his body at this time, but it had no cooling effect on the fanatical fire. It was like pouring oil on the fire. It was a murderous gas and a blood eating fanaticism, which distorted Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>In this scene, all the people were suddenly stunned. The original harmonious atmosphere was frozen in an instant. Then they saw that the little younger martial brother, who had always been gentle and gentle, suddenly exuded the murderous spirit that even the people in the demon sect just now didn&rsquo;t have. The people around him had to step back involuntarily. Looking at the man who suddenly became vicious, he took a step towards Qi Hao and Tian linger.</p>
<p>The blue sky on Liubo mountain seems dark.</p>
<p>Song Daren first stood out and stood in front of Zhang Xiaofan. I immediately felt that the little younger martial brother who grew up when he was a child had no familiar shadow at the moment.</p>
<p>Feeling someone standing in front of him, Zhang Xiaofan slowly raises his head and stares at Song Daren. Song Daren looks at him with bloodshot eyes at the moment, but he feels cold. He smiles and says, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s wrong with you, Xiaofan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan didn&rsquo;t answer, just a low voice, a little hoarse way: &ldquo;get out of the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His tone is very long and low, as if it took a lot of effort to speak out, but when he heard it, it was creepy.</p>
<p>Tian&rsquo;s face suddenly sank, and everyone was shocked.</p>
<p>Then, under the eyes of all the people, Zhang Xiaofan saw song Daren was still in front of him, and he clenched the fire stick with his right hand. Suddenly, a cool dark blue light came out of the stick, with a meaning of killing that had never been before.</p>
<p>Song Daren is really scared. It&rsquo;s not that the meaning of Su Sha is so strong. It&rsquo;s not that after Zhang Xiaofan went down the mountain for a month, the height of the road seems to be faster than before. It&rsquo;s that he respected and loved his younger martial brother since childhood. It seems that he really meant to kill him now.</p>
<p>He saw that Tian was not easy to see. He took a step forward with a gloomy face. Although he still thought Zhang Xiaofan was not song Daren&rsquo;s opponent, the disciple&rsquo;s magic weapon was very strange. On that day, he was in the limelight of the seven pulse martial arts conference, just afraid that song Daren was not easy to deal with.</p>
<p>At this time, Tian ling&rsquo;er ran out in front of Zhang Xiaofan and song Daren and said to her favorite younger martial brother: &ldquo;Xiaofan, what&rsquo;s the matter with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>That one is engraved in the deep face, that pair of bright eyes, this woman who is haunted by dreams, just standing in front of her, asking with care and concern</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan suddenly froze, the whole person froze, like waking up from a dream, the body&rsquo;s violent Qi retreated like the tide, but, however, he actually felt the pain of tearing, staring at the elder martial sister in front of him, there was a kind of feeling that he wanted to cry!</p>
<p>Do you know that at that moment of life and death, you are the one who most cares for you?</p>
<p>Do you know that dream back to Qingyun, thousands of lingering feelings, just for you?</p>
<p>You know</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pa&rdquo;, a loud crisp sound, Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s face was suddenly slapped by Tian, who was nearby, and the whole person flew out involuntarily, and drew an arc in the mid air, falling far outside.</p>
<p>The crowd stirred.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan fell to the ground, his eyes were full of stars, but he who had come back to God felt even more ashamed at the moment. How can I want to fight against my elder martial brother who has been taking care of me since I was a child, and I also have a fierce idea. It&rsquo;s just a heinous crime!</p>
<p>He struggled to get up, but his body was not straight and his feet were soft. He fell down again, and his half cheeks were swollen and red blood flowed from the corner of his mouth.</p>
<p>However. At the moment, he could not feel the pain of his body. He only shouted at himself with fear that he had never felt before: what&rsquo;s the matter? What&rsquo;s the matter? What&rsquo;s the matter with you. Are you crazy?</p>
<p>He raised his head and looked at the people in front of him, as if all of them were strangers at the moment. And they look at themselves like strangers they have never seen before.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the matter with all this?</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan stood up with difficulty. No one spoke. Everyone looked at him, but looked at his expression. But confusion was more than fear, as if he did not know what had happened.</p>
<p>Song Daren, after all, cherished Zhang Xiaofan from his heart. It was not easy to turn around and say to Tian, &ldquo;master, little brother, he and he didn&rsquo;t mean disrespect. He just, just&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo; It&rsquo;s hard for Tian to stop drinking. Song Daren dare not go on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not easy to be short and fat in the field, but now it looks like a towering God of wrath, walking to Zhang Xiaofan step by step.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s face showed a trace of fear, which, after all, was the master he was most afraid of when he was a child. He couldn&rsquo;t even imagine what he was going to face next?</p>
<p>Suddenly, a white figure stood in front of Zhang Xiaofan.</p>
<p>Everyone was shocked.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu&rsquo;s face is like frost, and his sword eyebrows are wrinkled. But in the face of the first bamboo peak of Qingyun gate, which is famous all over the world, he is still like a teenager without any fear.</p>
<p>He stood there in white as snow, as if he had been nailed to the ground, without moving any more. It is just that there are huge waves ahead of him, as if he can&rsquo;t be touched at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kuang Ding&rdquo;, in the sound of the Dragon chanting, the Dragon Sword suddenly came out of its sheath, and the green light enveloped him and Zhang Xiaofan, two people with the same life experience. With awe inspiring spirit, he didn&rsquo;t look at Qi Hao, the great elder martial brother he always respected, who kept winking at him. He decided, &ldquo;if you dare to touch Xiaofan again, you should kill me first!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Qi Hao took a breath of cool air and peeped at Tian hard to see, only to see how hard Tian&rsquo;s face was to see at the moment, which almost became pig liver color. He didn&rsquo;t want to know how angry he was.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that Qi Hao, as the eldest disciple of longshoufeng, has no reason to avoid. Moreover, Lin Jingyu has always been loved by his mentor, Taoist Cangsong, and can&rsquo;t be ignored in any case.</p>
<p>Looking at Tian&rsquo;s hard look, Qi Hao knew that there was no use persuading him. He had to run away quickly. Lin Jingyu said in a low voice: &ldquo;you are crazy, younger martial brother. This is their internal affairs. What are you doing. Even if the teacher is here, it&rsquo;s hard to say anything. Come with me! &quot;</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, Lin Jingyu was very different today. He snorted and said, &ldquo;if I go, Xiao Fan doesn&rsquo;t know how far he will be tortured by this man. He is a lonely man, just like me. If I don&rsquo;t stand on his side, no one in the world will stand on his side any more. &quot; When he spoke, he looked directly at the door of dazhufeng. Although he knew that the strength gap was too big, he looked at him. For the sake of the brother behind him, he had left life and death aside.</p>
<p>Qi Hao is dumb. Seeing that younger martial brother Lin has a bad temper, he is very anxious. In a moment of anxiety, Lin Jingyu&rsquo;s shoulder was suddenly covered with one hand.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu was shocked. Looking back, he saw Zhang Xiaofan standing behind him, half of his face swollen, but his eyes were already filled with tears, and his voice choked: &ldquo;Jingyu, I&rsquo;ll take your heart. Now it&rsquo;s my fault. I&rsquo;ll admit it to Shifu. Go back with elder martial brother Qi first! &quot;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu frowned and was about to speak, but Qi Hao said in a hurry: &ldquo;younger martial brother Lin, if you are here again, I&rsquo;m afraid it will make uncle Tian angry more and more, but it will hurt younger martial brother Zhang. Let&rsquo;s go. Let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said forcibly pulled him to leave. Lin Jingyu is struggling with himself, but he looks at Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s pleading eyes, hesitates in his heart, and pulls away. He finally gets pulled away by Qi Hao for a long time. When he leaves, he looks back at Zhang Xiaofan step by step.</p>
<p>Tian is not easy to look ugly. Everyone looks at each other under the gate of dazhufeng. No one dares to say a word.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan came to him in silence, knelt down, bent his head on the ground in front of him, motionless.</p>
<p>Tian didn&rsquo;t smile easily and said, &ldquo;ah! I don&rsquo;t dare to be. Who is this! Is there a master in your eyes who is so high in Taoism and murderous? &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s body shakes. He only knocks heavily on his head three times. He doesn&rsquo;t lift his head, and still lies on the ground.</p>
<p>Song Daren and others have always loved this younger martial brother. Looking at him like this, they have long forgotten Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s strange appearance and said to Tian, &ldquo;master, younger martial brother, he&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not easy for Tian to wave his hand. Everyone&rsquo;s words are choking in his throat. Tian Nan Yi looked at Zhang Xiaofan up and down, snorted angrily, and said coldly, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine that I have taught a disobedient person these years!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said that he would not turn back, turned around and left, but did not pay attention to Zhang Xiaofan.</p>
<p>Su Ru sighed and followed, but all the people had no choice but to follow. Only Zhang Xiaofan was left on the ground, kneeling alone.</p>
<p>His head, still not raised.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>When it was dark, people in the middle of the road went to the south of Liubo mountain to rest. There are more than a dozen natural caves here, which is very convenient. When I came up the mountain that day, I was liked by the people in the right way.</p>
<p>Qingyun gate is divided into four caves by four veins. Dazhu peak has the least number of people. In the west of the cave, there are dense forests next to it. On the other side, there are Longshou peak, Chaoyang peak and Xiaozhu peak. In the past, the caves were inhabited by Tianyin temple, burning incense Valley and other righteous people.</p>
<p>When Zhang Xiaofan came back this time, FA Xiang and FA Shan of Tianyin Temple met. Qi Hao also came to say hello. Lu Xueqi didn&rsquo;t come among the people of xiaozhufeng. He just didn&rsquo;t see Li Xun and Yan Hong of the burning incense valley.</p>
<p>But at the moment, he didn&rsquo;t think about these things. When he came back, he didn&rsquo;t dare to enter the cave, so he knelt on the rock outside the cave. From afternoon to now, it&rsquo;s dark. He knelt for more than four hours. Tian was not easy but he didn&rsquo;t mean to be soft at all.</p>
<p>Other disciples of Qingyun sect and people from Tianyin temple and burning incense Valley often come out to see it. They often form a group and point in the distance. Their laughter and sneer are faintly audible.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was ashamed, but he didn&rsquo;t dare to get up after all. However, after kneeling for so long, the pain under the knee is incomparable.</p>
<p>Suddenly there was a noise from the cave next to me, where the disciples of longshoufeng lived. Zhang Xiaofan didn&rsquo;t look up, but vaguely heard Lin Jingyu talking loudly and angrily there. It seemed that he couldn&rsquo;t bear it any longer, so he rushed over, but he was pulled by Qi Hao and other disciples.</p>
<p>Just from the noise, in the cave next door suddenly came out a voice with strong authority: &ldquo;Jingyu, you come in, I have something to say to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan knows that this is the voice of Uncle Cangsong, the first Taoist of longshoufeng. The disciples of longshoufeng are quiet. It can be seen that Taoist Cangsong is very dignified. A few days later, Lin Jingyu, who dared not disobey his master&rsquo;s orders, went in and never came out again.</p>
<p>In the night, the peace was restored, and the onlookers gradually dispersed, leaving Zhang Xiaofan, who was still kneeling, crawling at the entrance of the cave.</p>
<p>At this time, song Daren, he Dazhi, Du Bishu and other people came to the cave to plead with Tian, but Tian was not easily angry and shouted a few words, and they dared not say it again.</p>
<p>However, Tian ling&rsquo;er&rsquo;s excited voice came out before he was silent for a moment: &ldquo;Dad, what are you doing? Xiaofan has been kneeling outside for nearly five hours. What did he do wrong? Whether he hurt the elder martial brother or killed him, he has already admitted his mistake. You still don&rsquo;t let him in&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bang&rdquo; a loud sound, stone flying, think is not easy to field anger hard to rest, a palm hit on the hard stone, rock smashed. Tian ling&rsquo;er seems to want to talk about it again. She hears Su Ru whisper a few words and pulls her away. Then there is no voice. (to be continued. )</p>
