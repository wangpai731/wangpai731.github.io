      <p>Incense Valley, chamber of secrets.</p>
<p>The primitive screen separated the space of the stone chamber. Shangguan CE, dressed in grey, stood quietly in place and waited patiently.</p>
<p>After a long time, the old voice of Yun Yilan, the master of the incense burning Valley, came from behind the screen: &ldquo;I heard that younger martial brother, this time you tracked down Jiuwei Tianhu, and at the last minute, you suddenly ordered all the disciples to withdraw. Is that true?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shangguan CE shows a faint sneer at the corner of his mouth. He can guess who is listening to the sentence &ldquo;heard&rdquo; in Yun Yilan&rsquo;s mouth. In the whole burning incense Valley, besides himself, only Li Xun, the most beloved disciple of Yun Yilan, can speak with him here.</p>
<p>But Shangguan CE did not distinguish what, only slowly said: &ldquo;good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cloud Yi Lan is silent for a moment, way: &ldquo;so, do elder martial brother very puzzled, ask younger martial brother to teach me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shangguan CE leaned over the screen and said, &ldquo;I dare not. I met a man on the way to follow Jiuwei Tianhu, so I ordered all disciples to turn around immediately and report to elder martial brother immediately</p>
<p>The voice of cloud Yi Lan is obviously a Zheng, way: &ldquo;who is it that makes younger martial brother pay so much attention to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shangguan CE slowly spit out two words, way: &ldquo;Lich.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Behind the screen, there was a sudden silence, and there was no sound for a long time.</p>
<p>Shangguan CE stood there patiently. The reaction of Yun Yi Lan was in his expectation. When he saw the Lich that day, his heart was shocked. It was no small matter.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how many times, behind the screen, just came to the cloud easy LAN gentle voice: &ldquo;they, finally or can&rsquo;t help it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shangguan CE can&rsquo;t hear what the elder martial brother thinks in his heart from the voice of Yun Yi Lan. It was anxiety, it was shock. He couldn&rsquo;t hear it. He looked at the screen and said, &ldquo;a little bit more&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cloud Yi Lan &ldquo;um&rdquo; one, but this time some accident.</p>
<p>Shangguan CE took a deep breath and said, &ldquo;the Lich seized two of the five sacred vessels: the black staff and the bone jade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Cloud Yi Lan finally can&rsquo;t keep calm. Blurted out behind the screen.</p>
<p>Shangguance had a sneer in his heart, but his expression did not change at all. He said, &ldquo;it should be that the monster has found a Li wizard from somewhere, and then passed on his&rdquo; black fire &ldquo;magic. Then he used it to stir up a fight between the Miao and Li nationalities, and snatched the black stick bone jade from the great wizard of the Miao altar.</p>
<p>After that, the wizard of the Li nationality wanted to rebel against the demon, but the demon had been prepared to kill him with &ldquo;black fire pearl&rdquo; and take back the two sacred objects</p>
<p>Yun Yi Lan snorted coldly. He said, &ldquo;there are still such people who don&rsquo;t know how to live or die!&rdquo; After a pause, his voice was a little harsh, and he said, &ldquo;these sacred vessels are of great importance. Why don&rsquo;t you start?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shangguan CE was indifferent and said: &ldquo;when I arrived, the black stick bone jade had already fallen into the hands of the lich, and there was a dragon beside him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cloud Yi Lan is silent go on, just slowly sigh for a long time, way: &ldquo;the will of heaven. God! Our long-term plan will be destroyed like this! &quot;</p>
<p>Shangguance was silent.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Qingyun Mountain, Tongtian peak.</p>
<p>White clouds flutter, immortal spirit lingering, this is like the fairyland in the world, the sound of crane, Qingrun pleasant, reverberating in the sky.</p>
<p>Ten years ago, a fierce battle destroyed the &ldquo;Yuqing hall&rdquo;, which had already been rebuilt by this time, and looked like a thousand things. The scale is very large, which is even better than that in those years. Dozens of huge red stone pillars support the pillars, the top of the hall is made of yellow glass, under the sunlight. It is brilliant.</p>
<p>In the center of the top of the hall, it is as high as the top of a pagoda. The shape of the pagoda is made of Jasper rings, from large to small, from the bottom to the top. Topmost Yellowstone, crystal clear.</p>
<p>Eaves to all directions, flying out, East, South, West, North four carved gold dragon and pearl, Southeast, southwest, northwest, northeast four carved phoenix flying, Golden Dragon and Phoenix mouth all holding glass wind chimes, fluttering with the wind, making a crisp sound, adding a bit of Fairy Spirit.</p>
<p>In the wind chime of cranes, Lu Xueqi, dressed in white, slowly ascends the stone steps in front of Yuqing hall.</p>
<p>From time to time, there were several Qingyun disciples cleaning the stone steps. When they saw Lu Xueqi, they all nodded and saluted. Among them, one or two young youths who had just started their studies and were still light in morality were photographed by Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s appearance. After a look, they did not dare to look again, and their faces were slightly red and their heads bowed.</p>
<p>As usual, Lu Qi walked towards the end of the hall with no expression.</p>
<p>Behind him, there was a loud sound of &ldquo;Hua La&rdquo;, which broke the silence. Lu Xueqi didn&rsquo;t turn back. It was Qilin, the spirit beast of Qingyun gate in the cold pool of blue water, and climbed out of the water to bask in the sun and sleep late on the Bank of the pool.</p>
<p>Everything here is so peaceful and harmonious. Who knows that there was once a teenager who came out of here and threw himself into another dirty and bloody world?</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi finished the long stone steps, took a silent look at the tall Yuqing hall and walked in.</p>
<p>In the grand hall, the light shone through the open windows in all directions. It looked very bright and had no dark feeling at all. The leader of Qingyun sect and the most righteous person in the world, Xuan Zhenren, with a smile on his face, sits on the throne of the main hall. At the bottom right of him, there is another person, but Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s mentor and the first master of water moon in xiaozhufeng of Qingyun gate.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi is one of the stunned. She came back from southern Xinjiang. Because she was sent by immortal daoxuan, she first went back to tongtianfeng, changmen, to report to daoxuan. Then she planned to return to the mountain to see Master Shuiyue. Unexpectedly, master Shuiyue was also in tongtianfeng. Besides, there were no other people present in the Yuqing hall except for immortal daoxuan and master Shuiyue, as if they were waiting for her return.</p>
<p>Seeing Lu Xueqi enter the hall, daoxuan real man first smiles kindly. Although the master Shuiyue next to him is always indifferent, he is naturally different from others in his beloved disciple, and his eyes also show some affection.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi went up, first to daoxuan immortal line a gift, way: &ldquo;see the leader real person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she turned her head and saluted master Shuiyue. But to the teacher who loved her mother and daughter, she said casually, &ldquo;master, why are you here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan said with a smile, &ldquo;I received the news yesterday. Knowing that you are back in the mountain today, I sent someone to inform your master of the news. Besides, there are some trivial matters. If you want to talk to your master, you can simply ask her to come over. &quot;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi answered, and master Shuiyue sat aside. Looking at her beautiful disciple, I can see that Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s appearance of bullying Shuang Shengxue is as beautiful as ever without any expression, but I don&rsquo;t know how. Looking at it, I felt that her face was a little pale.</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue moved secretly in his heart, and his two eyebrows wrinkled slightly.</p>
<p>Daoxuan immortal does not have the experience that master Shuiyue and Lu Xueqi have been together for many years. At present, he doesn&rsquo;t think there is anything wrong with Lu Xueqi. He just smiles and goes on: &ldquo;Xueqi, this time, go to southern Xinjiang.</p>
<p>How is it going to visit Mr. Yun, the master of the burning incense Valley</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi was silent for a moment. Now she told her experiences in southern Xinjiang one by one, but she did not talk about the scene of parting with GUI Li in the middle of the night in Tianshui village.</p>
<p>Daoxuan immortal and master Shuiyue sat there without saying a word, listening to Lu Xueqi all the way. After hearing this, Yun Yilan, the leader of the burning incense Valley, still did not show up. Only when shangguance and Li Xun came out to explain, they looked at each other with strange looks in their eyes, but they did not speak.</p>
<p>Later. After listening to Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s expressionless remarks about the first World War in qilidong Middle School of Miao Nationality in southern Xinjiang, ghosts and sharp appeared. At the moment of fierce fighting, daoxuan&rsquo;s face became cold. However, master Shuiyue seemed to think more about her. At the same time, she could not help looking at Lu Xueqi more. She said that she was attacked by Li Xun, and she used the &ldquo;magic sword to control thunder&rdquo; for her ”At the moment of injury, the tone of speech has not changed. But the look in his eyes flashed.</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue sighed in his heart and closed his eyes.</p>
<p>After Lu Xueqi finished, daoxuan real man stepped back to master Shuiyue and looked at him. Cold hum a, way: &ldquo;Zhang Xiaofan that evil barrier, ten years ago did not have in addition to him, now as expected has raised tiger to become a disease.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue opened his eyes and, intentionally or unintentionally, looked at Lu Xueqi beside him and said faintly: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s all due to destiny. You can&rsquo;t ask for it. &quot;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s face seemed a little white again.</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan pondered for a moment and said, &ldquo;judging from what Xueqi said just now, this person&rsquo;s Taoism seems to have made great progress in the past ten years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue nodded his head slowly and said, &ldquo;Zhang Xiaofan can kill more than a dozen Li soldiers with the power of blood sucking pearl demon in an instant. After being injured by Li Xun, he immediately falls back on him. Even the famous Chunyang jade ruler in the burning incense Valley can&rsquo;t resist. This Taoist practice is no longer there&hellip;&rdquo; She looked at Lu Xueqi and said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s no longer under Qi&rsquo;er and Xiao Yi under your door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi has no expression.</p>
<p>Taoist priest shook his head slowly. Master Shuiyue was stunned for a moment and said, &ldquo;why, don&rsquo;t you think I&rsquo;m wrong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan sighed and said, &ldquo;the demon was attacked by Li Xun and hurt by the magic sword Yulei Zhenjue. Instead of being killed on the spot, he could fly back.</p>
<p>I expect that the one who can resist the power of the divine sword&rsquo;s true formula must be Da Fan Prajna, the true dharma of Tianyin temple, and then use our Taiji Xuanqing path to break open the magic force array of Shenjian Zhenjue. After rushing close to Xueqi, Xue Qi said that his eyes were like blood, and the red light of the magic wand of blood sucking beads was flourishing, so he must have used the power of blood eating demon to control Xueqi. From these points of view, he has integrated the three real dharmas. Most of his Taoism is better than our disciples. &quot;</p>
<p>He took a look at Lu Xueqi and said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s just that at that time, most of him was exhausted and at the end of his strength, so he couldn&rsquo;t hurt Xue Qi any more. Otherwise, Xue Qi&rsquo;s magic sword Yu Lei was broken. It would be extremely dangerous if there was no strength to fight back. Xueqi, it seems that this person has integrated Buddhism, Taoism and Demons into one. The Tao is strange and unpredictable. If you meet this person in the future, be careful. &quot;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s mouth moved, holding the fingers of Tianya sword, quietly clenched and loosened, and whispered: &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue looked at her appearance, sighed in her heart, and suddenly said, &ldquo;Qi&rsquo;er, you&rsquo;ve been working hard all the way, so go back to have a rest first. I have something to discuss with your master, and I will go back later. &quot;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi answered and looked at the real man daoxuan, who shook his head and laughed and said with a smile, &ldquo;look at my memory, I&rsquo;m really confused. Xueqi, there&rsquo;s nothing wrong here. Go back to xiaozhufeng and have a good rest. &quot;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi came out. She saluted daoxuan and said to master Shuiyue, &ldquo;master, I&rsquo;ll go back first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue nodded and said, &ldquo;you go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi bowed her head and answered, and then she stepped out slowly. After a moment, she disappeared in the sight of daoxuan immortal and Shuiyue master.</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan pondered for a moment and sighed, &ldquo;what a Zhang Xiaofan Oh, what a pity. &quot;</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue said faintly, &ldquo;that child has changed into this kind of appearance. We can&rsquo;t get rid of it! &quot;</p>
<p>Taoist immortal frowned and his face suddenly sank. He said, &ldquo;sister Shuiyue, what do you mean by this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue was indifferent. However, the tone of his speech remained the same, saying: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not meaningful. Zhang Xiaofan abandons the bright and turns to the dark, and we have something wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taoist immortal said in a deep voice: &ldquo;does younger martial sister Shuiyue think I was wrong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shuiyue took a look at daoxuan and saw that his face was rarely serious. He sighed and said slowly, &ldquo;elder martial brother, don&rsquo;t think about it. If it was me, it would be the same as what you did.</p>
<p>As I said just now, Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s fate is the result of fate. It is the will of heaven! &quot;</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan was silent for a while, and his face relaxed gradually. However, in the hall, the atmosphere seemed to be a little embarrassed. After a while, Taoist priest said slowly, &ldquo;you heard that just now. Xue Qi, who has gone before, still hasn&rsquo;t seen the cloud Valley master. What do you think? &quot;</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue snorted and said, &ldquo;the old man, Yun Yilan, has always been mysterious and mysterious. I don&rsquo;t know what to do this time. But he is a man of practice, but he can&rsquo;t be underestimated. There are no people in southern Xinjiang who can harm him. So we don&rsquo;t have to worry too much about it, but&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>Daoxuan was stunned. &ldquo;What?&rdquo; he said</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue looked at immortal daoxuan and said, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t send any other disciples this time. You only send Qi&rsquo;er to the burning incense Valley in southern Xinjiang, and you didn&rsquo;t discuss it with me in advance!&rdquo; Say it. Her face suddenly cooled and gave two sneers.</p>
<p>Taoist immortal frowned and said, &ldquo;younger martial sister, I told you about the reason later. Don&rsquo;t you have any objection?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue stood up. Light way: &ldquo;although I do not object, but my apprentice&rsquo;s temperament has always been strong and persistent, you know, everything or do some room is better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, without waiting for daoxuan to speak, he walked out of the hall.</p>
<p>Looking at her back, daoxuan suddenly shook his head and sighed.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Huqishan.</p>
<p>Ice stone room.</p>
<p>Under the ghost king, Qinglong, Youji and others are standing in the stone room, next to Gui Li and Xiao Bai. In the most secluded corner, the ghost man in black is standing there alone.</p>
<p>But now, no one has the mind to pay attention to that dark figure. All the people&rsquo;s spirits are looking nervously at the big wizard standing beside the ice stone platform of Biyao.</p>
<p>Ghost Li can&rsquo;t help but quietly clenched his fist. On this occasion, he didn&rsquo;t let Xiao Hui follow him. Looking at the aging figure of the great wizard and the face of Biyao in the white smoke, his body began to tremble a little.</p>
<p>Ten years, ten years of desire, all the time entangled in the heart of the nightmare, this hope, now in front of us.</p>
<p>The great wizard&rsquo;s body shook slightly, and everyone behind him moved. The devil could not help but take a step up. Even the king of ghosts, who had always been very calm, had a twitch in the corners of his eyes.</p>
<p>The great wizard turned his head and laughed at the crowd, saying that he was not in a big way. The people were relieved.</p>
<p>Only after a night&rsquo;s rest last night, the appearance of the great wizard I saw today did not seem to be much better than that of yesterday. On the contrary, it seemed to have a more declining trend. Every wrinkle on the old man&rsquo;s face is deeply engraved in it, just like squeezing out his only life.</p>
<p>In the stone chamber, only the big wizard&rsquo;s voice of breathing heavily.</p>
<p>The ghost king and the ghost Li who stood beside looked at each other and saw the faint anxiety in each other&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the wizard stretched out his hand, pointing to the direction of the &ldquo;Albizzia bell&rdquo; held by the two hands of Biyao.</p>
<p>The golden bell stood up between the white hands, flashing soft light. On the bell body, slowly reflected the old hand which was getting closer and closer.</p>
<p>The next moment, the withered hand touched the Albizzia bell, and all the people in the cold stone room held their breath.</p>
<p>From the tip of the wizard&rsquo;s finger, a faint blue light slowly lit up, gradually shining, but as the light kept flashing, the wizard&rsquo;s face became more lifeless, straight like ashes.</p>
<p>As if to hear what call general, suddenly, the Acacia bell that has been silent for ten years burst out a crisp bell, gently reverberating.</p>
<p>The ghost king and GUI Li suddenly showed an excited look on their faces. The two men could not help but take a step forward at the same time. It was only after a moment that they woke up at the same time that they controlled themselves, but their eyes were fixed on the fingers of the great wizard.</p>
<p>After the clear bell rang. A layer of golden light slowly appeared on the bell of Albizzia julibrissin. Although it was not bright, almost at the same time, the face of the great wizard suddenly showed a hard look. In a moment, the cold air suddenly rose in this cold stone room.</p>
<p>All the people present changed their color almost at the same time. Anyone who could stand here was a great expert in the cultivation of Taoism, almost subconsciously. Ghost king and GUI Li as well as Xiao Bai float up.</p>
<p>But just as the cold air expanded in an instant, the soft golden light on the Albizzia bell suddenly turned to be blazing, almost like a visible fire. &ldquo;Boom&rdquo; spread rapidly and incomparably around the stone chamber.</p>
<p>The great wizard was the first to bear the brunt, and his body was already weak. At that time, the whole body was hit by the blazing light, and a mouthful of blood gushed out.</p>
<p>The ghost King&rsquo;s figure is like a ghost. He appears next to the great wizard and catches his body. The ghost appears in front of him at the same time.</p>
<p>The soul eating magic stick appears in the air, and a dark green halo appears in a twinkling of an eye, blocking the flaming golden bell which is rushing like a mountain. But the small white figure appeared in the side of the cold stone platform, hand up, a white light slowly down, covering the Albizzia bell.</p>
<p>In a moment, the trembling Albizzia bell slowly calmed down, the golden light gradually disappeared, and the temperature in the stone chamber returned to its original state.</p>
<p>All the people looked at the great wizard supported by the ghost king, and saw that they were hit by this blow. The big wizard&rsquo;s seven orifices had blood oozing out. Anyone could see that the old man had reached the verge of death, with only a little spare force left.</p>
<p>All the people looked at each other in silence. Zheng Zheng speechless.</p>
<p>Until, a gasp * * broke the dead silence. The great wizard slowly opened his eyes and struggled to stand upright.</p>
<p>The ghost king was moved and reached for help, but the great wizard shook his head slowly. The ghost King nodded silently, turned a trace of admiration in his eyes, and slowly took back his hand.</p>
<p>The great wizard gasped for a moment, raised his sleeve, slowly wiped off the blood from his mouth, and began to speak. However, the voice was hoarse and incomparable: &ldquo;the remaining soul of this lady is indeed in this joyous bell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everyone was silent.</p>
<p>The great wizard took a deep breath and said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s just that the Albizzia bell is a foreign treasure. It contains spiritual power. It&rsquo;s like a strong Dharma array. Although this can protect the soul of the young lady, outsiders have to break it if they want to take it out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words just said here, his body suddenly shakes, just wipe the mouth of blood silk, it is a mouthful of blood spurt out again. He took a few steps and held the old man in his arms. The corners of his mouth moved. Finally, he could not help saying, &ldquo;master, you&rsquo;d better have a rest first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The great wizard took a look at the young man, and with a faint smile, he suddenly lowered his voice and said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t forget what you promised me that day in qilidong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, master!&rdquo; he nodded</p>
<p>The great wizard gave a long breath, slowly pushed away the ghost, turned to the ghost king and other people: &ldquo;now, to break the Huanhuan Bell&rsquo;s spiritual power, but not to damage the girl&rsquo;s soul, I have to set up the&rdquo; summon the soul &ldquo;array of Southern Xinjiang witchcraft to see if I can draw the lady&rsquo;s soul out of the bell, cough, cough&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A sharp cough interrupted his words, and the crowd looked at him speechless. Everyone could see that the old man had run out of oil and the lamp was dry. Moreover, he wanted to make such a &ldquo;evocative spirit&rdquo;. I really don&rsquo;t know if he could hold on to that time.</p>
<p>As soon as the ghost King bit his teeth, he stepped forward and clasped his fist to the great wizard and said, &ldquo;master, I am so grateful for my little girl. There is no need for the master to worry about other things. Just rest assured that no matter what the result is, the ghost King sect will not let the master down. &quot;</p>
<p>The great wizard nodded slowly, his eyes were comforting, and he gasped for a moment. He said in a low voice, &ldquo;summoning spirits is the art of ghosts and ghosts. It is not suitable for too many people to be present. So please leave Guili childe and the patriarch for help. Let&rsquo;s go out for the time being.&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li and GUI Wang nodded at the same time, and other people did not wait for them to say more. After a while, only the great wizard and GUI Li were left in the cold stone room.</p>
<p>The great wizard&rsquo;s face faded, his body slowly trembled, but he could not stand any longer. His body was soft, and he slowly sat down on the ground. (to be continued. )</p>
