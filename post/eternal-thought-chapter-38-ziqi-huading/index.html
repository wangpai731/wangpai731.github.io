      <p>Bai Xiaochun was excited. He got up and moved his body. He also controlled the small wooden sword to fly back and forth in the courtyard. Sometimes he quickly roared away, sometimes he stopped suddenly, which implied a sense of great importance.</p>
<p>The whole wooden sword is unpredictable in this yard, and soon forms bursts of sword spirit. It seems that a strong wind is blowing out of thin air, which makes Bai Xiaochun more excited here.</p>
<p>A moment later, with a swing of his right hand, the small wooden sword disappeared in a flash and returned to his palm. It looked colorful and inconspicuous, but in fact, the small wooden sword, which had been refined for three times, has changed in essence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you can master both weightlifting and weightlifting, then by combining them, you can condense There is only one magic power method in Ziqi controlling tripod skill! &quot; Bai Xiaochun took a deep breath and looked forward to it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Purple gas into tripod!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun took up the wooden sword, closed his eyes and stood in the yard. After a long time, his right hand suddenly raised and pointed to the air. In front of him, the aura in the body that could not have been seen actually flashed into the sky. On a closer look, the aura was like silk, which was rapidly sketching the shape of a tripod.</p>
<p>It seems that there is some mysterious force guiding the tripod to take shape quickly.</p>
<p>At the same time, bursts of astonishing pressure also spread from the tripod. The spirit pressure was so great that it was even stronger than before when flying swords.</p>
<p>But Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s face is also very pale, and the aura in his body is rapidly consumed. Until it costs nearly 80%, the tripod is completely shaped and emits more intense spiritual pressure in the air. As Bai Xiaochun points forward, the tripod suddenly rushes out and smashes it.</p>
<p>At the moment of touching the ground, the tripod will be broken first, and a large amount of aura can spread and explode.</p>
<p>The roar was even more intense, and even spread all around. The ground within a hundred feet of the square was immediately rattled and cracks appeared in an instant.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Xiangyun mountain is guarded by an array, and the cracks soon recover and disappear. However, many other disciples are still surprised by the power of the shock.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun took a breath, but he didn&rsquo;t expect that the purple gas melting cauldron was so strong. This blow even gave him a feeling that he could not fight against.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is indeed the only magic power in the skill of controlling tripod with purple Qi. It can be used only after the lifting of heavy weights and lifting of lightness are realized clearly.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s eyes showed bright light, but soon frowned. Although the magic power is powerful, it can be consumed too much.</p>
<p>In fact, even if he didn&rsquo;t use up the eight pure Qi, he would only consume the pure Qi.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is an introduction to this magic power in the purple Qi controlling tripod skill, which is divided into three grades. At the moment, the tripod I condense is just inferior. If I get to the middle grade, I can condense two tripods. When I get to the top grade, not only three tripods will appear, but also they can be fused together to form a big tripod.&rdquo; Thinking deeply, Bai Xiaochun sat down on his knees and began to spit. When the bright moon was hanging high, he opened his eyes, and his eyes showed a bright light. His accomplishments in his body were almost restored.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This kind of magic power can be used as my Assassin&rsquo;s mace. In this way, if those Zhou Xinqi&rsquo;s admirers annoy me, I will hit them.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun just felt relieved, but she thought of the disciple named Qian, and her eyebrows wrinkled again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can be the inner door, at least more than eight layers of condensate&hellip;&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun suddenly felt uneasy. She looked at her skin when she was meditating. Her eyes flashed. She got up and took a few steps forward. Her right hand raised her thumb and index finger, and the black light was shining. She made a snap to the other side.</p>
<p>There was a crackling sound from the void, even a faint sense of bursting. Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s pinching power seemed invincible. He looked at his two fingers and hesitated for a moment, but soon calmed down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a killing move Life saving. &quot; Bai Xiaochun thinks that the greater the power of this life-saving move, the better. However, Bai Xiaochun is really afraid of immortal longevity.</p>
<p>He also tried to continue to practice the immortal longevity work after he had become the immortal iron sheet, but once he practiced, the feeling of hunger appeared again.</p>
<p>In the South Bank of Lingxi, there are only chicks left for Lingwei chicken, so there is no more to eat. Bai Xiaochun is sure that he will be starved to death by relying on his daily spiritual food.</p>
<p>He also looked for other animals to eat all over the mountain, but since the reputation of chicken stealing maniac became famous, there were not many animal raising areas in sanshanben on the south bank, and they were well protected.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun was also worried. At the moment, she thought of this problem again. She was thinking about how to solve the problem of hunger. Suddenly, she thought of the original longevity pill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&hellip;&rdquo; When Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s eyes brightened, there were many kinds of miraculous drugs, which not only increased cultivation, but also replenished vitality. After experiencing the immortal iron sheet, Bai Xiaochun also found that the cultivation of immortal longevity work actually needs vitality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very accomplished in plants and plants. Although I haven&rsquo;t been promoted, I can make medicine by myself. Although the price of the finished medicine is high, it&rsquo;s much cheaper on plants.&rdquo; The more she thought about it, the more she thought it was a way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this way, I will get in touch with refining medicine in advance. When I go to the examination and promotion later, my grasp will be much greater, and it will be easier to refine the Zhuji pill in the future.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun immediately had a decision, leaning on his chin, his eyes revealed thinking, until the next morning, his body directly jumped up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To make medicine, you need a prescription. It&rsquo;s simple. You don&rsquo;t need to be promoted to be a pharmacist. There are scattered prescriptions sold in the shops at the foot of the mountain.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun felt his pocket. When he arrived at Xiangyun mountain, he had almost no money to spend. As an outside disciple, he could get some spirit stones every month, and now he has saved a lot.</p>
<p>For these things, he never cared about them. At the moment, he galloped down the path to Xiangyun mountain.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun went down the mountain for the second time since he came to Xiangyun mountain. The first time he went down the mountain was to buy Herbs for pills. At this moment, he almost left Xiangyun mountain. Immediately on Qingfeng mountain, there were two figures running straight to a yard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is senior brother Chen here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elder martial brother Chen, Bai Xiaochun is down the mountain!&rdquo; These two figures are very strong and well cultivated. They are both four layers of condensation gas. Now they are excited. When they enter the courtyard, they can see a big man sitting cross legged in the yard.</p>
<p>The big man was even more massive, and his eyes opened and closed after hearing the words, and a touch of fine light flashed by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bai Xiaochun? Is he finally coming down the mountain? &quot; The big man grinned grimly, and his body suddenly stood up. The whole person was like a hill, which was not vulgar. He had the strength of five layers of condensed gas, which was transformed into spiritual pressure.</p>
<p>He was Chen Fei of the supervisor&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>At that time, the three of them were good in the supervisor&rsquo;s room. They wanted almost anything there. They were not only served by miscellaneous servants, but also were supplemented by spirit stones. However, they didn&rsquo;t want to be pushed up the mountain by Bai Xiaochun and other people and became disciples of other schools. They hated Bai Xiaochun and others deeply after these two years of hard life.</p>
<p>But I think Zhang daphou is not easy to offend, and Heisan Pang is even more difficult to deal with. Although Bai Xiaochun was good at the beginning, she felt that she was the weakest. She planned to find a chance to revenge. On the one hand, Bai Xiaochun almost never went out of the clan. On the other hand, Chen Fei didn&rsquo;t dare to violate the rules although he had some background in this sect.</p>
<p>After all, his greatest source is just a cousin of an inner disciple. He doesn&rsquo;t pay much attention to him on weekdays. Taking care of him during his chores is the limit.</p>
<p>Therefore, he has been waiting for Bai Xiaochun to go out for nearly two years. Now he has finally waited. Chen Fei is very confident. In his first days of cultivation, he has broken through to the fifth layer of condensate gas. He also inquired about Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s accomplishments. He knows that although Xiaobi is the first, he wins by chance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I was bluffing by him, I really thought he realized that lifting weights is light. Hum, we were forced to become disciples of other schools. We should spit it out this time!&rdquo; Chen Fei has a fierce look in his eyes. He doesn&rsquo;t intend to kill Bai Xiaochun, but he is determined to let the other side break his bone and tendon, and lie down for at least a year.</p>
<p>Although zongmen will still investigate this kind of thing, one is not caught on the spot; the other is that there is no death; and third, Chen Fei has a good head, which can turn a big thing into a small one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t blame me for being inferior to others!&rdquo; Chen Fei&rsquo;s body shook and went straight to the foot of the mountain. Two people followed him behind him. They soon went down the mountain and found a way to return from Fangshi. They waited here.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun didn&rsquo;t take long to find two first-order prescriptions. One was to replenish aura and the other was to nourish vitality. These prescriptions were rare at high level, but many at low level. Most of them were for ordinary people to take to strengthen their health.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s useless for others, but Bai Xiaochun is like a treasure. He has turtle shaped pot. After three times of alchemy, the effect is immediately different.</p>
<p>After buying several pieces of herbal medicine for making miraculous medicine with the remaining spirit stone, Bai xiaochunmei left Fangshi with a small song and walked on the mountain path of huizongmen. He was more happy when he imagined that he had made great achievements in refining medicine.</p>
<p>But just after he had been walking along the mountain path for a short time, his face suddenly moved and his steps stopped suddenly. After six layers of condensation, he was much more sensitive. He immediately realized that there were three people breathing in front of him. The three people were hiding in the grass and their heart beat faster when they saw themselves.</p>
<p>Seeing Bai Xiaochun pause, Chen Fei&rsquo;s three figures suddenly rush out and stand in front of Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bai Xiaochun, the gratitude and resentment in those years should be ended today!&rdquo; Chen Fei stares at Bai Xiaochun. He is determined and starts to smile grimly. Behind him, they both smile grimly and quickly, forming an encircling momentum.</p>
