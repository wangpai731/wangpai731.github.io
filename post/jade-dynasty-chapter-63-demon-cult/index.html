      <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A light shout, Zhang Xiaofan woke up from a dream, panted in the dark, and felt his whole body was wet with cold sweat.</p>
<p>These days, it seems that Zhang Xiaofan suddenly began to dream about his childhood nightmare when he heard the words &ldquo;general wisdom&rdquo; mentioned by FA Xiang. The scene of the village, which was deeply engraved in his heart, rushed to him, as if to swallow him up.</p>
<p>The fire stick was still lying beside him. From the stick, there was a familiar cool feeling, as if everything was the same as before.</p>
<p>However, after that, Zhang Xiaofan also felt that the strange magic weapon tied to his right arm seemed to send out the opposite of the fire stick, with a warm breath, into his body.</p>
<p>He suddenly felt out of breath. In the dark, where no one could see him, he curled up quietly.</p>
<p>Who knows, there are too many secret people, so tired?</p>
<p>In the dark, other people are sleeping peacefully. There are always night watching disciples outside the cave, so everyone is very relieved. Listening to their calm and familiar breathing, Zhang Xiaofan was stunned.</p>
<p>In the distance, the thin, even in the dream, seemed to come with her own gentle voice. Dark cut off the line of sight, Zhang Xiaofan seems to think that he can see clearly, the beautiful woman smiles, in this quiet night, sweet sleep.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t know who it is in her dream?</p>
<p>He stretched out his hand, held the fire stick gently, took it to his chest, snuggled up tightly, as if it was the only way to stay with him and never give up.</p>
<p>Trance, he suddenly thought of that pair of calm to die fox.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s me, do I have the courage to die with the one I love?</p>
<p>He thought quietly in the dark.</p>
<p>East of sunrise, sea breeze. On this day, the sky is high and the clouds are light. It&rsquo;s a fine day.</p>
<p>Several people left the cave where they lived. Yu Qi&rsquo;s magic weapon flies to the deep part of Liubo mountain. He searches carefully all the way, hoping to find the disciples of the demon sect.</p>
<p>Tian ling&rsquo;er is the first, &ldquo;Amber and Zhuling&rdquo; is shining red. Fly in the front, song Daren and he Dazhi follow her closely, Du Bishu and Zhang Xiaofan fly in the last.</p>
<p>Among their disciples, except song Daren, who used the immortal sword &ldquo;ten tigers&rdquo;, others used Zhu Ling, or a treasure pen, and even weird and Funny Dice, fire sticks and so on. When the disciples of Qingyun sect almost all used the immortal sword, they were very eye-catching.</p>
<p>But after all, it&rsquo;s not Qingyun Mountain. On Liubo mountain, we don&rsquo;t talk about the people in the demon sect. There are more than ten other sects just in the right way. There are all kinds of magic weapons, but they are not so prominent.</p>
<p>However, when the disciples of the righteous colleagues are bored, they discuss in private. If there is a good person commenting on each magic weapon, then there is an &ldquo;expert&rdquo; who points out that the most bizarre magic weapon in your hands on Liubo mountain is the dice magic weapon of a disciple of dazhufeng of Qingyun gate, and the most rustic one is the fire staff magic weapon of a disciple of dazhufeng of Qingyun gate. It can be seen that the leader of Qingyun sect is really hiding the dragon and crouching the tiger. Not to be underestimated!</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how Tian would feel if he heard such comments?</p>
<p>At the moment, disciples of all schools in the right way are in groups, flying around. The wind on Liubo mountain is howling, and the light of various colors is rapid and slow. Twinkle and pass, very good-looking.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan looked aside from the magic weapon, only to see the righteous people flying to the fan around. And in their own group of close quarters, probably dozens of Zhangs away, the right hand side is a clear woman, naturally is the little bamboo peak disciple. Lu Xueqi also flew between them. Her clothes fluttered and her hair brushed her shoulders. With her cool and beautiful face, she seemed to be in a state of coming out of the world.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s mind moved. He did not dare to look at it more. Looking back, he looked at the other side, but he saw that it was dozens of feet away. He was the disciples of longshoufeng. There were about six or seven people, including Qi Hao and Lin Jingyu. At this time, Lin Jingyu also looked over from afar, smiling and waving.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan smiles.</p>
<p>After the disciples of longshoufeng, there are also a group of people. It seems that they are the rest of the disciples of Chaoyang peak.</p>
<p>At this time, suddenly listening to Tian ling&rsquo;er&rsquo;s clear roar in front of him, Zhang Xiaofan looked forward and saw Tian ling&rsquo;er&rsquo;s formula shake, amber and Zhu Ling&rsquo;s red light flash, and the sound of &ldquo;woo&rdquo; carried her pretty figure, but rushed to the sky, which was several times faster.</p>
<p>Song Daren is shocked. He knows that the little younger martial sister is very active. This opportunity is rare. It&rsquo;s not like there are many restrictions on Qingyun Mountain. Once she comes out these days, she often flies freely. Su Ru is worried about this. She said her daughter several times. Today, when she left, she told song Daren to watch her.</p>
<p>However, Tian ling&rsquo;er grew up in the public&rsquo;s favor since she was a child. Song Daren could not say a word about her, and how could he see her. However, he had to speed up and catch up with her.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan, he Dazhi and others are also driving magic weapons. They closely follow each other. In a blink of an eye, they are far away from longshoufeng, xiaozhufeng and others.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan speeds up, catches up with Tian ling&rsquo;er, flies beside her and stealthily looks at her. Tian ling&rsquo;er&rsquo;s face was smiling and excited. Today, she was dressed in red with the amber and Zhuling, which was even more beautiful.</p>
<p>The wind was cold in the air, but Tian linger&rsquo;s happy laughter came from it. Zhang Xiaofan listened to it, and his heart was warm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Junior brother!&rdquo; Song Daren&rsquo;s voice came out of nowhere.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan quickly turned around and said, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter, senior brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren, holding his huge sword, said with a smile, &ldquo;little martial brother, I didn&rsquo;t expect you to enter the country so fast in Taoism. It&rsquo;s only a short time, and you&rsquo;ve come to this point.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was grateful and said, &ldquo;elder martial brother, this is all about your teaching.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren shook his head and said with a smile, &ldquo;I dare not take credit. Just now, the speed of flying is much faster than me, the third and the sixth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan then found out that Tian linger had just seen the speed of flying. He was in a hurry, so he tried to catch up. He didn&rsquo;t pay attention to the side. Unexpectedly, he flew to the front of the three senior brothers. But at the moment, song Daren and he Dazhi are flying behind them. They are calm and relaxed. If they really want to fly, they may not be worse than themselves.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan blushed and said, &ldquo;elder martial brother, I&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Half of what he said, Tian ling&rsquo;er turned around and smiled. He was even more happy when he saw Zhang Xiaofan. Big voice way: &ldquo;small fan, so son flies comfortable?&rdquo;? You see, how high and blue is the day? &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan turned his head. Breathe deeply and smile.</p>
<p>The sky is high, the clouds are light and the sky is blue. It&rsquo;s really refreshing, but. But how can it be compared with a smile of a beloved woman in my heart?</p>
<p>Tian ling&rsquo;er enters into the wind with her hair flying. She sees the blue sky above her head and the green mountains below her feet. In the distance, there is a boundless blue ocean, overlooking the sea and the sky.</p>
<p>The landscape is picturesque and beautiful. Tian linger is in a good mood. Smiling and smiling, I turned around and moved to the side.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan suddenly sees Tian linger flying near, looks at her and says, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter, elder martial sister?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian ling&rsquo;er said with a smile, &ldquo;Xiaofan, do you remember when we first caught Xiaohui?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan had some doubts and said, &ldquo;remember, what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian ling&rsquo;er reaches out and holds his arm. Smile: &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was in a strange place, but he saw that Tian linger&rsquo;s magic weapon sank violently, and he fell down quickly. Zhang Xiaofan quickly lowered the magic weapon and followed her closely. And behind them. Song Daren and others were far away from each other. They didn&rsquo;t hear what they said. They were unprepared. How fast the magic weapon was in the mid air, so they rushed to the front in an instant.</p>
<p>Three people cry together, hurriedly stop body shape. Looking back, I saw that younger martial sister and younger martial brother were flying to the green mountain forest at their feet. They couldn&rsquo;t help shaking their heads and laughing bitterly, so they had to hurry to catch up. Anyway, the life of the school is to search for the evils of the evil cult. The same is true for searching in the forest. However, they are a long way from Zhang Xiaofan and Tian linger.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan followed tianling&rsquo;er closely, and in a twinkling fell to the bottom of the forest. He only listened to tianling&rsquo;er&rsquo;s smile in front of him, and turned around and said, &ldquo;Xiaofan, hurry up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she said, amber and Zhuling, like a spirit snake, turned over and roared under her beautiful figure. The red light was shining and flew into the forest. Zhang Xiaofan looked at the red shadow in front of him. His heart was filled with blood, and he didn&rsquo;t want to think about anything else. He flew straight down.</p>
<p>Like other places in Liubo mountain, the forest on the top of the mountain is full of huge ancient trees, which are straight to the sky, even on the ground. There are also many shrubs and thorns, which are hard to settle.</p>
<p>As soon as they entered the forest, they felt suddenly quiet around them. There was no cold wind in their ears. A fresh breath of trees came to them. Tian ling&rsquo;er, with a smile on his face, stands on the amber and Zhuling, whose figure is like electricity. In this ancient forest, he shuttles between numerous ancient trees.</p>
<p>From behind, Zhang Xiaofan saw the beautiful red shadow flying up and down, fast among the dense branches and leaves, accompanied by the sharp light roaring sound. She was like the most beautiful fairy in the world. In this place outside the world, in the ancient wood forest, in the world where countless green leaves seemed to be full of laughter and faint cheers, she leaped out the most beautiful dance.</p>
<p>The figure, like electricity and light, clings to the body of a huge tree. It seems extremely dangerous, but it glides gently with gentle grace, never touching a bit.</p>
<p>That figure, such as infatuation, such as drunk, trance in the youth time, green mountains and clear waters, there are happy laughter, echoing away.</p>
<p>He suddenly opened his arms with a smile, and the fire stick was shining with green light, carrying him, chasing her, flying in this ancient and peaceful forest.</p>
<p>As if, this time, like this, will never end</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Somehow, it seemed suddenly a little overcast, and the thick clouds in the sky gradually increased.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan took back his eyes and thought that this overseas place, after all, is different from the Central Plains. It was just a sunny day with high clouds and light clouds. It seems that it will be cloudy in a twinkling of an eye.</p>
<p>He and Tian ling&rsquo;er have been flying in the dense forest for a long time, but not even a disciple of the demon sect. Finally, in a small mountain depression, Tian ling&rsquo;er sees a stream below. After flying for half a day, he is also tired, so he calls Zhang Xiaofan down. Now he is washing his face with the stream water.</p>
<p>The stream is winding in the ancient forest, shallow and clear. There are many round pebbles in the stream. It is very beautiful with the shimmer of clear water. On both sides of the stream, apart from some sand and stone shoals, farther away, there are dense forests. At a glance, the forests seem endless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Xiaofan.&rdquo; Tian ling&rsquo;er suddenly called out. Zhang Xiaofan turned to look at her, but Tian ling&rsquo;er washed his face and half washed it. He found a very beautiful stone in the stream. He reached for it and took it out. He turned his head to Zhang Xiaofan and said, &ldquo;is this stone beautiful?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan took a look at the stone. He saw that the stone was just the size of his thumb, but there were three-color stone patterns on it. It was roughly orderly around it, like a ribbon. It&rsquo;s really pretty. Then he smiled and looked up to Tian ling&rsquo;er. He was about to answer, but suddenly he opened his mouth slightly. I can&rsquo;t speak.</p>
<p>That familiar, beautiful face, smiling at him. Just now when washing her face, the clear stream has not been wiped away. The crystal clear water drops are light cloth on her white face. From time to time, you can see that the water drops are gentle. Slip down from her skin, pass by her face, under her smooth and soft lips, but still linger, finally with a touch of moving grace, dropping gently.</p>
<p>And that pair of bright and clean bright eyes, long eyelash edge, also have a few water drops congealed on it, like tears, but like white pear flowers after rain. It&rsquo;s so beautiful.</p>
<p>Tian ling&rsquo;er said angrily, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m asking you</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan woke up and said, &ldquo;what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian ling&rsquo;er brightened the stone in front of his eyes and said, &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t it nice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan breathed deeply, low, but seemed to burst out from the deepest heart of the voice: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s really beautiful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian ling&rsquo;er nodded and smiled, took out the silk scarf from her arms, wiped the water off her face, and then carefully wiped the stone again, put it in her arms, and turned to Zhang Xiaofan. With the most beautiful smile in his eyes, he said: &ldquo;after we go back, I will give this stone to brother Qi, he will love it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sky of Liubo mountain. As if in that moment, it was gloomy again.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan stood there, like suddenly frozen, head bowed, motionless.</p>
<p>Tian ling&rsquo;er walked forward a few steps and found that there was no sound behind her. Turn around to see Zhang Xiaofan still standing still, surprised: &ldquo;Xiaofan, go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan raised his head slowly, with a smile on his face slowly, but he didn&rsquo;t know why his lips seemed to tremble faintly. &ldquo;Elder martial sister, we are going too fast. Why don&rsquo;t we wait for the elder martial brothers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian ling&rsquo;er snorted and didn&rsquo;t care about the tunnel: &ldquo;leave them alone, let&rsquo;s follow this stream! Go upstream and see if there are any thieves of the demon sect. By the way - &ldquo;she smiled and said,&rdquo; by the way, see if there are more beautiful stones. &quot;</p>
<p>What is it, like burning your body?</p>
<p>What is it, such as the impulse to roar to the sky?</p>
<p>It turns out that the evil fire of Jiuyou is burning in the heart, burning the soul of the body.</p>
<p>He lowered his head, his voice became a little strange hoarse, and whispered, &ldquo;OK!&rdquo;</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Amber and Zhu Ling, wrapped around her waist, set off her red figure, more and more beautiful. Two people walked along the stream for another half hour.</p>
<p>Along the way, Tian linger looks relaxed and looks around. Zhang Xiaofan follows her silently.</p>
<p>This stream seems small, but its length is not short. After a long walk, it can&rsquo;t see the source. There is another hill ahead. There is a stream at the corner. The stream flows out from there.</p>
<p>Tian ling&rsquo;er was tired after walking for half a day. He turned to Zhang Xiaofan and said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not early, Xiaofan. Let&rsquo;s go to this mountain stream and have a look. If we haven&rsquo;t found it yet, let&rsquo;s go back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan nodded silently.</p>
<p>Tian ling&rsquo;er looked at the little younger martial brother for two more times. He was a little strange, but he didn&rsquo;t pay attention to it. He turned around and walked forward.</p>
<p>They quickly went to the corner of the mountain stream and looked in, but they were surprised. It turns out that behind the front cliff, there is a huge cave. It&rsquo;s ten feet high. This stream flows out of this cave. Because the cliff blocks the view, not to mention flying in the air, but standing a little farther nearby, we can&rsquo;t see the cave, but it&rsquo;s very secret.</p>
<p>Tian ling&rsquo;er frowned and said to Zhang Xiaofan, &ldquo;shall we go in and have a look?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan took a look at the cave. He saw that in addition to the light at the cave entrance, there was darkness in the deep, and he felt uncomfortable for a while.</p>
<p>These days, especially after he went down the mountain, he went into two caves, one is wanbat ancient cave in kongsang mountain, and the other is Blackstone cave outside Xiaochi Town, but he didn&rsquo;t have a good impression. When he saw this cave, he was disgusted instinctively. In addition, he was in a very bad mood. He said, &ldquo;elder martial sister, I don&rsquo;t think this cave is inhabited. Why don&rsquo;t we go back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian ling&rsquo;er nodded and said, &ldquo;OK! I think so too. Let&rsquo;s&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>Suddenly, a sound of breaking through the air came from their two heads. A moment later, the sound of &ldquo;abetting&rdquo; was heard all the more, and many people came here.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan and Tian linger immediately looked up, and their faces turned white a moment later. The clothes of those people in the sky are the people of the demon sect. Look at the number, just count it. Not under dozens of people.</p>
<p>They look at each other and lose their color. Tian linger is more clever. He knows that there are many high-ranking people in the demon sect. It&rsquo;s hard to avoid them if he suddenly flies away. Under crisis. Had to risk, a pull Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s hand, the two ran into the dark cave.</p>
<p>Darkness, engulfed the two of them.</p>
<p>Before long, the people of the demon cult fell down one after another. The targets were all around the mountain stream. Later, someone seemed to light a torch, and then everyone came to the cave.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan and Tian linger, who were originally hiding near the cave, had to grope for their way to the cave. Their hearts were hanging in the air at the moment. At this time, the difference between the two sides is too big. If they are found, they are definitely unable to resist.</p>
<p>But fortunately, because there are so many people in the demon sect, it seems that they didn&rsquo;t expect to be found by the right people. They didn&rsquo;t control the pace of talking and laughing all the way, so they managed to cover up their slight movements and sounds.</p>
<p>All the way around, I finally got to a spacious place. The people in the demon sect stopped, and the people with torches around me found some cracks in the stone. Insert the torch. It seems that they often come here.</p>
<p>In the open space of the cave, it lit up.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan and Tian linger also stopped and hid in the place where the light couldn&rsquo;t shine. The atmosphere dare not go out.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan looks out secretly. In the distance, the disciples of the demon sect form a semicircle, and they find big stones to sit down. Some of them seem to be rude and arrogant, so they just sit on the ground.</p>
<p>From a distance. It is true that the people in the demon sect are quite different from the people in the right way. There are many strange people. Zhang Xiaofan is very impressed. The wild dog Taoist with a dog face is also sitting in it. Next to him are the eldest brother, Liu Hao, Lin Feng and the beautiful young woman without name.</p>
<p>In addition, there seems to be a young man standing behind them. His face is strange, but Zhang Xiaofan has never seen him.</p>
<p>Tian ling&rsquo;er suddenly whispered in his ear, &ldquo;Xiao Fan, do you think there are many factions in the demon sect?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan felt his ears itchy, but he felt a pain in his heart. He didn&rsquo;t dare to think about it. He nodded and looked out. As Tian ling&rsquo;er said, although the people in the outer demon sect are roughly surrounded by a half circle and facing a direction together, there are three or two people sitting there, but the others are still a group of people sitting together, with a clear division of factions.</p>
<p>At this time, only one of the three or two people said in a low voice: &ldquo;everyone, please be quiet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly, all the people in the demon sect calmed down. It seems that the master of the voice has great authority.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was so far away that he couldn&rsquo;t tell who was making the sound, so he quietly stretched his neck and looked at the scene. But I feel that the clothes around me are gently rubbed, but Tian ling&rsquo;er is also looking out.</p>
<p>The torch on the stone wall is burning quietly, occasionally making a crackling sound.</p>
<p>Suddenly a tall, dark skinned man stood up in the demon sect, and in one direction, he said in a loud voice: &ldquo;venerable emissary, this time the&rdquo; ghost king &ldquo;called me to this remote island. He said that it was Kui Niu, a strange beast that was born only three thousand years ago. But now, after so many days of searching, he has not found a single hair of cattle, but has led those annoying people in the right way to come here and pester them all the time Fight on. What should I do now? &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan said to Tian ling&rsquo;er softly, &ldquo;what is Kui Niu?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian ling&rsquo;er thought for a while, and finally shook his head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he said</p>
<p>The two men looked into the field again, only to see that the man opened his head, and then there were many people following him. Although the wild dog Taoist&rsquo;s conduct was not high, his temperament seemed to be very fierce, so his voice was the largest among all the people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s reasonable to say that&rdquo; ghost king &ldquo;is superior to the old man. Naturally, he won&rsquo;t pay attention to such small things. However, if we want to suffer here without any reason, why should we give an explanation to Laozi?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elder brother Nian listened to his rudeness and frowned. He was trying to reach out to him and ask him to be quiet.</p>
<p>At this time, at the time when people were talking and making a lot of noise, suddenly there was a sweet voice of a woman, but her voice was quite indifferent, and she said lightly, &ldquo;do you want to know the reason?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as the woman&rsquo;s voice came out, Zhang Xiaofan was shocked in his heart, and his body stretched out a few more points involuntarily. He saw that under the light of the torch, there was a woman in green, standing up slowly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Baguio. (to be continued. )</p>
