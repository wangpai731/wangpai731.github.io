      <p>A month later, all the disciples of ziding mountain are going crazy. This month, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s appearance has taught them what it means to regard being a martial uncle as a career.</p>
<p>They found that no matter where they were, as long as they were on the purple tripod mountain, they would see a white and clean man with a thin body. His face was full of pride, but he could not hide his pride. When he saw people, he coughed. If someone didn&rsquo;t know him, he would take the initiative to introduce himself</p>
<p>Uncle Bai, these three words, they are about to break the skin of their mouth, but They can&rsquo;t help it. Bai Xiaochun is the leader&rsquo;s younger brother. He has more generations than all his disciples. If any disciple dares to disrespect him, it is a violation of the rules.</p>
<p>Finally, people found Zhang daphou and asked him to come forward and persuade him. Then they sent Bai Xiaochun away like his ancestors Qingfeng mountain.</p>
<p>Another month later, the disciples of Qingfeng mountain They&rsquo;re crazy, too.</p>
<p>In particular, Chen Fei&rsquo;s three people, especially in this month, have lost their souls. Bai Xiaochun often appears in front of their door on Qingfeng mountain. If Chen Fei and Chen Fei do not shout out a hundred times of Uncle Bai, it will not be over.</p>
<p>Even under Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s fault, if Chen Fei and Chen Fei were not respectful, they would be reported to the law enforcement court. Chen Fei was frightened and cautious all day. At last, he almost cried and begged for money Dajin and was tortured. Bai Xiaochun let them go and left Qingfeng mountain with a sigh. He also began to blame himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the outer disciples know me, but there are others who haven&rsquo;t seen me, especially Qian Dajin, who really thinks I forgot?&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun pondered for a long time and nodded deeply. He felt that life was more fun from then on, so he went to find the inner disciples.</p>
<p>After a period of time, although Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s figure still appeared on the three peaks, most of them were in the area where the inner disciples lived. In his capacity, he could enter almost all places of Lingxi sect.</p>
<p>But soon, Bai Xiaochun lost interest. Most of the inner disciples were closed, and he didn&rsquo;t see many figures in several months, especially Qian Dajin. When countless arrays were opened outside the cave, he was afraid to go out. Bai Xiaochun was blocked at the gate of Qian Dajin for a month, but he didn&rsquo;t see the other party. He didn&rsquo;t respond to any shouting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun stands at Qian Dajin&rsquo;s gate and tries to blow open the array. However, it&rsquo;s very difficult to open the array of the inner disciples&rsquo; cave. Bai Xiaochun can&rsquo;t see it, so she has to find someone to come and work together to open Qian Dajin&rsquo;s cave.</p>
<p>At this time, two figures came quickly from the distance. They were two inner disciples, one tall and one short. When they approached, they looked at Bai Xiaochun. Instead of meeting, they spoke calmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle Bai, can you give my little Lord a face and let it go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The little Lord of my family, God bless you.&rdquo; This high inner disciple specially emphasized one sentence.</p>
<p>Shangguan Tianyou, that is the South Bank of the three peaks, the first of the three Tianjiao!</p>
<p>Even though he is a disciple of Lingxi sect, he will become a foundation builder in the future. Many elders of Lingxi sect have different blessings on Shangguan than others. In particular, he is regarded by Nan&rsquo;an as a hope to surpass the north bank, so he is vigorously cultivated.</p>
<p>And the followers of Shangguan Tianyou are numerous on Qingfeng mountain.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun looks as usual. If he had changed before, he would have been afraid. But although he was afraid of death, it did not mean that he was timid. As long as it was something that had nothing to do with death, he was very bold.</p>
<p>Now his identity, has let him in the door, almost no death happened, now look at the two people, Bai Xiaochun smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you see me, I don&rsquo;t see you. You two are brave. Who gave you the confidence to be so arrogant and disrespectful? It was the Shangguan God who blessed you?&rdquo; White small sleeve a swing, light mouth.</p>
<p>As soon as he uttered his words, the faces of the two inner disciples changed. Among them, the senior one showed his sharpness in his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle Bai, be careful when you speak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as he said this, before he could continue, the figure of Bai Xiaochun disappeared in front of him. When the tall inner disciple was stunned, the strong wind swept his face, and Bai Xiaochun appeared in front of him.</p>
<p>The speed was so fast that they could not see clearly. Even before they could react, Bai Xiaochun raised his right hand and slapped the sound of breaking sky thunder, which fell on the face of this high inner disciple.</p>
<p>The clothes and robes of this high inner disciple suddenly shed a light of protection. This is one of the magic weapons for the inner disciple. But the light almost just came up. At the moment of touching Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s palm, it broke into pieces and could not stop the slightest bit. Let Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s palm contain infinite power, like a mountain rock, suddenly fell down.</p>
<p>With a bang, Venus appeared in the eyes of the high inner disciple, and his mind was humming in an instant. He felt as if he had been hit by a mountain, spurting blood, and throwing out his body suddenly. For example, a kite with broken thread was directly fanned out tens of meters away, and even the scream didn&rsquo;t come out. He was in a coma in pain.</p>
<p>This scene was so sudden that the short inner disciple beside him was stunned, his mind was buzzing, and his body subconsciously retreated. He looked at his comatose companion who had been slapped by Bai xiaochunyiba, and then looked at Bai Xiaochun. He took a breath and swallowed hard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You You&hellip; &quot; He pointed at Bai Xiaochun, his body trembled and his mind was in a daze. He never thought that Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s physical strength was so shocking.</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s the eighth condensate layer</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elder, is it you, an inner disciple, can point to it like this?&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun turned to look at the short inner disciple and walked forward when he opened his mouth.</p>
<p>The short inner disciple screamed, and his body suddenly retreated. But before he withdrew far away, the wind howled, and Bai Xiaochun instantly approached and slapped him in the past again.</p>
<p>At this time, a voice with a cold, suddenly came from the bottom of the mountain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop it!&rdquo; When the voice came out, a figure came rapidly.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun didn&rsquo;t even look at it. The palm of his hand was faster. With a bang, the short inner disciple&rsquo;s teeth flew out and blood was sprayed. The whole person&rsquo;s neck almost twisted and flew out. He fell to one side and fainted.</p>
<p>After all this, Bai Xiaochun shook his hand and looked up at the man who was approaching from the foot of the mountain. He was a middle-aged man. His accomplishments were as good as Chen Heng&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>He stares at Bai Xiaochun and laughs angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you hear what I just said? Damn it, Bai Xiaochun, you&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want to be slapped, nephew?&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun raised his chin and opened his mouth with a smile. The former two, together with the one in front of him, saw at a glance that they had no respect for themselves at all, even with contempt in their bones, as if they were superior. He was very disgusted with such inner disciples.</p>
<p>As soon as he uttered his words, the middle-aged man&rsquo;s face was overcast and his voice stopped suddenly. Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s physical strength here shocked him. He was also impatient. In retrospect, he immediately took a deep breath. In addition, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s identity, even the law enforcement office could not say anything about what he had done before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bai Xiaochun, my little Lord asked you to come and see you.&rdquo; The middle-aged man stares at Bai Xiaochun. After a long time, he takes a deep breath and forcibly suppresses his anger. He tells him the purpose of his coming here. He comes to let Bai Xiaochun pass by under the order of the official Tianyou.</p>
<p>In his opinion, the young master of his family has made a fuss. Bai Xiaochun is just a lucky disciple and a clown like figure. He killed several vulnerable members of the Xiuzhen family. If he was not lucky, he could not let the sect to publicize. It was not worth it. He even sent a message from the young master who hoped for a golden elixir in the future.</p>
<p>Even if only let this white Xiaochun visit in the past, in this middle-aged man to see, is also a loss of identity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about a layman, even if he is Tianjiao, let me see him? He should have come to see me! &quot; From this incident, Bai Xiaochun clearly felt the arrogance of Shangguan Tianyou. In his own capacity, the other party didn&rsquo;t come in person, and even if he didn&rsquo;t personally summon him, he let himself go to see him.</p>
<p>As soon as the sleeve was swung, a strong wind blew open, and the middle-aged man&rsquo;s eyes immediately showed anger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bai Xiaochun, my little master asked you to visit him, which is a big face for you. How many people want to see you have no chance. You&hellip;&rdquo; As soon as he said this, his face changed and he suddenly stepped back, but it was still a step late. Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s body instantly appeared in front of him, and it was still a slap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dare you The cultivation of the middle-aged man&rsquo;s nine layers of condensation Qi broke out in an all-round way, and the wind blades turned into illusions and blocked them in front of him. However, at the moment when these wind blades appeared, they roared in the sky. Under Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s palm, they all collapsed and could not stop a bit.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s slap, the instant collapse of all obstacles, fell on the middle-aged man&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>The middle-aged man&rsquo;s body was thrown out and he barely got to his feet a few dozen feet away,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even Chen Heng is not as good as Chen Heng. No wonder he will take charge of it. Get out!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun small sleeve a shake, proud hum.</p>
<p>The middle-aged man looked at Bai Xiaochun in horror. His body was shaking. His left face was bulging. When the blood from his teeth overflowed, he retreated quickly.</p>
<p>Until the other party is far away, Bai Xiaochun turns to look at Qian Dajin&rsquo;s cave and squints. He is afraid of death. Therefore, he is always the one who wants to kill himself.</p>
<p>Even if Qian Dajin finds Shangguan Tianyou, Bai Xiaochun will not let it go. During this period, he seems to be at home at will, but in fact, he has already launched an investigation into Qian Dajin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I can&rsquo;t do anything about you if I hide in it?&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun hums coldly and turns to leave. In his present status, after a while, the jade slips fly out of the law enforcement hall, shuttles through Qian Dajin&rsquo;s cave and appears in front of Qian Dajin.</p>
<p>Like Bai Xiaochun at the beginning, they were all compulsory and dangerous tasks. Qian Dajin was bitter for a long time and had to go out to carry out There is also the idea of going out to avoid disaster.</p>
<p>However, he underestimated Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s revenge. For such a task, he had arranged dozens for Qian Dajin, and secretly contacted Hou Yunfei. The Hou family is a Xiuzhen family with a deep foundation. He attaches great importance to Bai Xiaochun here. In addition, Hou Yunfei and Hou Xiaomei are natural allies.</p>
<p>Naturally, it will help to ensure that Qian Dajin will fall unexpectedly in this execution.</p>
<p>The law enforcement office did not know about Qian Dajin. However, Bai Xiaochun fell down at that time, and it was not suitable to spread the news. Therefore, although there was no immediate investigation, it was recorded.</p>
<p>Now when Bai Xiaochun comes back, he wants to deal with it. The law enforcement hall does not stop him from doing so. He is left to do it. Even internally, Qian Dajin has been listed as dead.</p>
