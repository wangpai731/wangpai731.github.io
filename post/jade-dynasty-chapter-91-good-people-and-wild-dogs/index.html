      <p>In the dead water, with more and more rain, the wind is blowing gradually.</p>
<p>The fur on little grey monkey&rsquo;s body is wet. It&rsquo;s attached to his body. Now he curls up and hides in Xiao Huan&rsquo;s arms motionless. He only has a pair of smart eyes. He still drips and turns. He looks at the distance and Xiao Huan.</p>
<p>The rain fell all over the sky, and the originally dark swamp was now more gray, and the surrounding area was gray.</p>
<p>On Monday, the fairy pulled out his robe and covered his head. He sat under the tree, but Xiaohuan didn&rsquo;t stand or sit. After a while, he smiled bitterly and squatted down gently, holding the ash tightly so as not to let the wind and rain hit him. As for himself, it was also drenched at this time, which was also unthinkable.</p>
<p>The wild dog Taoist was so elated that he came over with an umbrella. Looking at his face, he couldn&rsquo;t find any words such as bravery for justice, pulling out the umbrella to help, pitying the fragrance and cherishing the jade. He said: &ldquo;Hey, little girl, do you want an umbrella! Is it hard to be caught in the rain? &quot;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan looks up to the wild dog Taoist in the wind and rain and smiles. The rain hits her white and beautiful face and bursts out like scattered pearls.</p>
<p>The wild dog Taoist smothers for a while. He came here to ask Xiaohuan for an umbrella to keep out the rain. Then the wild dog Taoist master made a big laugh at the young girl. Finally, he proudly went away and became a bad man. It was really very happy and comfortable!</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, Xiaohuan was unexpectedly bigger than he expected. He didn&rsquo;t say anything, let alone beg him. He was filled with complacency and lost his fortune. The wild dog Taoist was very angry and gave Xiaohuan a fierce look.</p>
<p>This one eye, but somehow, let him a little distracted.</p>
<p>In front of the young and beautiful girl, quietly squatting, silent patience wind and rain. The wind and rain howled between the heaven and the earth, suddenly in the eyes of the wild dog, as if all the raindrops fell on her slightly thin body.</p>
<p>The clothes are wet. They stick on her body. The black hair is a bit messy. Some strands fall on her cheek. Set off by the wind and rain and pale cheeks, there are breathtaking desolate beauty.</p>
<p>Her shoulders, originally some thin and thin, each raindrop dropped and then bounced up and then scattered like crystal debris. As if gently trembling, as if the white skin, close to the clothes.</p>
<p>The wild dog Taoist suddenly turned around, stopped looking at her, and grasped the umbrella involuntarily.</p>
<p>It seems to remind someone of saying: &ldquo;I am a bad person, I am a bad person, I am a bad person&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan didn&rsquo;t plan to talk to him, but this time she was curious. Seeing the strange behavior of the wild dog, she said something inexplicably: &ldquo;Taoist, what do you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wild dog Taoist was frightened. Somehow, he felt weak in his heart and took a look at Xiaohuan. Seeing Xiaohuan&rsquo;s eyes looking strange, she was looking at herself. On her white face, the rain fell.</p>
<p>It is her figure, in the wind and rain, but also a bit of chuchuchupathetic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s up to you!&rdquo; Suddenly the wild dog was furious and roared loudly.</p>
<p>Small ring Zheng for a while, shrugged his shoulders, lowered his head to go, but see monkey small ash is looking at himself. I couldn&rsquo;t help but smile and spit out my tongue at it.</p>
<p>Little grey grinned twice.</p>
<p>The wind blows and the rain blows. This storm seems to never end. Xiaohuan gradually felt a little cold. When she was worried, she suddenly gave a &ldquo;eh&rdquo; sound. She only felt that the wind and rain on her head suddenly decreased a lot. She looked up, but she was stunned.</p>
<p>The wild dog Taoist did not know when to walk back to her. He put out his hand and covered her head with an umbrella. For only a moment, the rain wet his body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here you are, umbrella!&rdquo; It seems that the wild dog Taoist can&rsquo;t get along with someone.</p>
<p>Xiaohuan stood up and said in surprise, &ldquo;Taoist, you&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wild dog Taoist&rsquo;s eyes glanced at her face, but saw Xiaohuan&rsquo;s slightly shocked face, some crystal water drops were slipping quietly, and some fell on her slender eyelashes, reflecting the beautiful brilliance in her bright eyes, which was moving.</p>
<p>The wild dog Taoist immediately put the umbrella in her hand and walked away. Regardless of the weather, he shouted: &ldquo;you little girls love to pretend to be pitiful, hateful, hateful all day long!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan took the umbrella, looked at the back of the dog Taoist, and suddenly smiled. His voice was as clear as the wind bell in the rain. He laughed loudly: &ldquo;Taoist, you are a good man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wild dog Taoist dare not look back. &ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; he said angrily, &ldquo;nonsense, your master is a kind of villain from birth. He will fight against you all his life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan stood with an umbrella and smiled at the figure of the dog Taoist.</p>
<p>The wild dog Taoist left his umbrella for a while. He was wet all over. He looked around, but he couldn&rsquo;t find a place to hide from the rain. At last, he went under the small tree where Monday fairy sat and snorted. He also learned the appearance of Monday fairy. He pulled his clothes on his head and covered his head. He was silent and allowed the wind and rain to blow.</p>
<p>Zhou Yixian looked at the ugly face of the Taoist wild dog nearby, and saw that his face was complicated and strange, upset and embarrassed. Suddenly he laughed. He couldn&rsquo;t bear it. He could hardly even put down his clothes. He laughed all the time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you laughing at?&rdquo; said the wild dog Taoist</p>
<p>On Monday, the fairy pointed to him and laughed. Even the wind and rain hit him in the face. He laughed and said, &ldquo;I am a bad person, I am a bad person&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Taoist wild dog was red and red when he arrived. It turned out that the fairy&rsquo;s ears were sharp on Monday. Xiaohuan didn&rsquo;t hear clearly. He heard it in the distance.</p>
<p>At the moment, on Monday, when he saw that Taoist wild dog had done a good deed, he seemed to violate some principles. He was very angry. He couldn&rsquo;t bear it. He laughed loudly and almost fell.</p>
<p>Wild dog road people are angry, Teng ground stood up, Monday fairy was scared, mouth Wu from ha ha smile, body then back, unexpectedly rainy day road slip, the foot of a inattentive, &ldquo;bang&rdquo; backward fell out, fell in a mud pit, covered with mud.</p>
<p>The wild dog Taoist was stunned for a moment, and saw the immortal dancing on Monday, which was very funny. He was filled with anger and disappeared invisibly. He couldn&rsquo;t help but also laughed loudly.</p>
<p>He two people make fun of each other chat up scold, immediately quarrel endlessly. Xiaohuan stood in the distance, smiling and not coming forward.</p>
<p>At this time, the wind and rain poured down, as if the rain was bigger, and there was a mass of killing between the heaven and the earth, but there was still a place with a touch of warmth in this dangerous and deadly water.</p>
<p>At dusk, the rain suddenly came to an abrupt end, and the night before was about to end. After a moment, it&rsquo;s gone. I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s the unique weather here?</p>
<p>Xiaohuan took a long breath, closed her umbrella and looked up to the sky. Although it was dark and yellow, but after the heavy rain, the fog receded a little, but the sky seemed a little brighter than the day.</p>
<p>Even the rotten smell in the air is now gone.</p>
<p>Xiaohuan looks back. Looking under the small tree, the immortal and the wild dog Taoist were still sitting there on Monday.</p>
<p>Just now, when the wind and rain were heavy, the two still quarreled loudly, but now they are suffering from the wind and rain. Obviously, they have no spirit. They are all powerless to put down the hooded clothes, making a loud noise and pouring water from their clothes.</p>
<p>Xiaohuan smiles, turns around and puts down Xiaohui. The small ash falls to the ground, jumps two times, immediately the whole body shakes, splashes the water bead shakes everywhere disorderly, even the small ring also dodges.</p>
<p>Xiaohuan laughs and scolds. She sees a piece of water grass nearby. It looks like a small pond. She goes to find a place with less water grass and looks down.</p>
<p>The pond is full of water and grass. It&rsquo;s the place with a little spacious water surface, which seems to reflect into a faint, crisp and blue color. I can&rsquo;t see how deep the pond is. Xiaohuan looks at the water and looks at her reflection in the water. Slowly tidy up the appearance, will be disturbed by the wind and rain hair, slowly close, but the clothes on the body after all, wet by the wind and rain, stick on the body, it is very uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Far behind. On Monday, the fairy and the wild dog seemed to quarrel again, but their words were not loud and they didn&rsquo;t really listen to each other. As for the surroundings, they suddenly became quiet. From the endless wind and rain to now, they seem to feel special silence.</p>
<p>Even on the green grass nearby, the crystal water drops glide down along the green veins, and the sound of dropping into the water surface of the pond seems to be very loud.</p>
<p>Xiaohuan can&rsquo;t help but breathe deeply, the sweet air after the rain.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, there was a sharp and nervous squeak from the quiet little ash behind.</p>
<p>Xiaohuan is scared, but suddenly she&rsquo;s hoarse. In the pond in front of her, in the dense water and grass in front of her, there was a pair of eyes that were more than twice the size of the ordinary people, staring at her.</p>
<p>Xiaohuan lost her voice and screamed. In the distance, both the immortal and the wild dog Taoist were shocked, but they didn&rsquo;t wait for their reaction. They saw a sudden outbreak of water in the pond in front of Xiaohuan. A thick water column started up and hit Xiaohuan directly.</p>
<p>Little gray screams!</p>
<p>Xiao Huan&rsquo;s face is white, but her mind is still not flustered. She takes a step back subconsciously. Her left hand shrinks to her bosom. She says that sooner or later, the water column will hit Xiao Huan. Suddenly, an orange halo will be sent out from Xiao Huan&rsquo;s left hand, forming a light curtain, blocking her in front of her.</p>
<p>The thick water column was blocked face to face by the orange light curtain. It stopped in the middle of the air and could not move forward for half a minute. At the same time, there was a hoarse snort in the water column. Only saw the water column shaking in the middle of the air, mixed with a black shadow in the white water flower, and wanted to fall back into the pond.</p>
<p>Xiaohuan was just about to back away. At this moment, she heard a sharp roar in the air. The shadow of the yellow goose was like electricity and light. It flashed in front of her. It was jinpinger.</p>
<p>I saw the golden bottle with a pretty face and evil spirit, waving its right hand, and the purple air suddenly rose into the water wave of the pond, which made a huge bang for a moment. A turbulent water wall was aroused in the pond and rushed to the sky, which was more than a few feet high.</p>
<p>The black shadow was forced out by her life, but she still had some spare power. Although she didn&rsquo;t dare to fight with Jin Ping&rsquo;er from the front, she tumbled back and fell between the water and the grass. She saw her body wriggling and swimming forward like a fish.</p>
<p>Everyone is stunned. The monster looks like a person, but this kind of action in the water can not be done by ordinary people. The golden bottle frowned, but did not catch up. The monster&rsquo;s shadow was about to disappear into a mist in the distance of the pond.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, at this time, the monster was hoarse and angry again. There was a slight flash of dark blue and blood red light in the mist, and the monster turned back immediately, as if it was extremely afraid of the dark green light.</p>
<p>However, when he was in the air, he suddenly saw the green water plants in the pond under his feet, which extended from the direction under his feet to both sides. All of a sudden, all of them withered quickly and turned brown. Even on the water surface, there was a faint black color. Only in the direction of the Golden Vase, the water plants remained unchanged.</p>
<p>The monster seemed to roar at the end of his life, but he didn&rsquo;t dare to fall into the pond after all. He flew to the Golden Vase, and obviously wanted to fight before he died.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sister, be careful!&rdquo; cried Xiao Huan</p>
<p>The gold bottle son&rsquo;s face was as usual, and a sneer appeared on his pretty face. He saw that the black monster was getting closer and closer. The gold bottle son&rsquo;s eyes flashed and his right hand rose. Zimang was so prosperous that people around could not see what magic weapon was in the bright zimang. Then they saw zimang like a knife and chopped at the monster. The monster &ldquo;roared&rdquo; a stuffy shout. The body was shaken up to a height of ten feet in the air, and then fell heavily, hands and feet twitching, it seems to be dead.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s getting quieter all around. It&rsquo;s in the rough pond just now. The water wave also gradually calmed down. The eyes of all the people looked at the monster on the ground. Then, all the people, including the Golden Vase, were stunned.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a monster indeed, but it&rsquo;s a personal monster.</p>
<p>It is also like human beings, with arms and legs, even in the body, there are tight clothes. It just seems to be for convenience in water, so there are few clothes.</p>
<p>On the exposed skin, one by one, it seems to be something like scales.</p>
<p>But the most shocking thing is its head, which is the head, lips, gills and even eyes of a fish. It has no eyelids.</p>
<p>Now. The monster of the fish&rsquo;s head fell to the ground, bleeding constantly from its mouth, and remained motionless. It seemed that it was hit hard by the gold bottle. Life is split.</p>
<p>Xiaohuan looks at the monster in the ground and feels a little cold. She shrinks to the back of jinpinger subconsciously. Jinpinger reaches out and taps her shoulder to comfort her in a low voice.</p>
<p>Aoqing, from the mist ahead. Slowly walk out of the two people. Although they walk out at the same time, they are far away from each other. It seems that they are still wary of each other. It&rsquo;s Qin Wuyan of GUI Li and WAN Du sect.</p>
<p>The fierce eyes turned, pausing on the little ring face behind the gold bottle, and then moved away.</p>
<p>Xiaohuan looks at Guili and Qin Wuyan, and her heart shakes involuntarily. The three most outstanding young masters of the demon sect suddenly meet in secret. The reason is confusing and exciting.</p>
<p>Qin Wuyan went to the monster and kicked it with his feet. The monster turned over and did not move.</p>
<p>Qin Wuyan said lightly: &ldquo;dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little grey who was hiding aside called twice and jumped on his shoulder.</p>
<p>The ghost Li looked at the wild dog Taoist, looked at the immortal and Xiaohuan on Monday again, seemed to frown, and then said slowly: &ldquo;all that should be said, that&rsquo;s it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he said this, he turned around and wanted to go away. Qin Wuyan suddenly said, &ldquo;brother GUI Li, this monster that is not human but not animal suddenly appears here. It&rsquo;s quite strange. Don&rsquo;t you have any idea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ghost Li stopped and didn&rsquo;t speak, but Jin Ping&rsquo;er looked at Qin Wuyan and said, &ldquo;how do you know what this is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Qin Wuyan was shocked for a while, then he shook his head slightly, and looked at Jin Ping&rsquo;er and GUI Li&rsquo;s face. They didn&rsquo;t seem to know the origin of the monster. Just then, a man walked out and said in a loud voice, &ldquo;I know the origin of this monster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the same time, the three people were startled. Suddenly, they saw that it was the immortal on Monday. Even Xiaohuan was also surprised and said, &ldquo;Grandpa, do you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Monday, there was a bit of mud stuck on the immortal&rsquo;s face, but at the moment, his demeanor was very unusual. He stood up with his hands on his back and looked proud. He said, &ldquo;your grandfather has wandered all his life and walked more bridges than you. Do you think I live in vain? This monster is called &ldquo;Fishman&rdquo;. In fact, it&rsquo;s not a monster. It&rsquo;s a fishman of 100000 mountains and 63 different races in the south of Xinjiang. &quot;</p>
<p>GUI Li and others are all shocked. Naturally, everyone knows that there are sixty-three other nationalities in the wild area of South Xinjiang, but it&rsquo;s unheard of. But it&rsquo;s not nonsense to look at the immortal appearance on Monday.</p>
<p>Gold bottle son frowns: &ldquo;that is strange, the South Xinjiang is not less than ten thousand miles away from this dead water, this fish man ran here, but why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, this question toppled the complacent Monday fairy, grabbed his head and said: &ldquo;then I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everyone was silent for a moment, but there was no result when they thought about it again. Suddenly, the ghost turned around and walked away. The monkey Xiaohui lay on his shoulder, turned around and waved to Xiaohuan, grinning.</p>
<p>Xiaohuan also smiles.</p>
<p>The wild dog looked at Xiaohuan and immediately followed him up, but he didn&rsquo;t walk a few steps. Suddenly, Xiaohuan cried behind him, &ldquo;Taoist priest, there are many dangers ahead. You should be careful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gold bottle son a Zheng, look to small ring, but see small ring slightly and smile, facial expression but also no change, it is the front wild dog Taoist walking fast, also don&rsquo;t know whether to hear or pretend not to hear, head also don&rsquo;t return, quickly follow the ghost.</p>
<p>Qin Wuyan took a look at the direction of the ghost, walked to the Golden Vase, smiled and said: &ldquo;the golden fairy&rsquo;s&rdquo; Purple awn blade &ldquo;is famous all over the world. Today, it&rsquo;s really famous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jin Ping&rsquo;er smiled lightly and said: &ldquo;childe Qin made fun of me. How can I compare with you? If I apply a little poison casually, I will turn this pond into a poison pond. In 50 years, nothing will grow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Qin Wuyan&rsquo;s eyes were fixed, and his face seemed cold. After looking at the gold bottle for a while, he said slowly: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve developed the duckweed poison for half a year. It&rsquo;s originally a small skill of carving insects, which is not in the eyes of an expert. I&rsquo;ve never used it. The golden fairy knows that I admire it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jin Ping&rsquo;er met his eyes, but he didn&rsquo;t mean to give up. He said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m flattered, young master Qin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Qin Wuyan looked at her again, a cold light flashed in his eyes, then a smile came up on his face, nodded, and said: &ldquo;so, I&rsquo;ll leave first, what I&rsquo;ve promised&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gold bottle son interrupted him, way: &ldquo;you rest assured, that matter I know how to do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Qin Wuyan smiled and said, &ldquo;OK.&rdquo; With that, he nodded to Xiaohuan, said hello, turned around and walked away, and soon disappeared into the mist in the distance.</p>
<p>When Qin Wuyan&rsquo;s figure disappeared, Jin Ping&rsquo;er was still silent for a moment, and suddenly a long breath came out.</p>
<p>Xiaohuan stood behind her, almost at the same time feeling that the body of the original gold bottle had been tight, until now just relax.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sister, are you ok?&rdquo; Xiaohuan is worried.</p>
<p>Gold bottle son slightly shakes his head, looked at small ring one eye, soft voice way: &ldquo;just now I didn&rsquo;t arrive in time, you didn&rsquo;t hurt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan smiled, shook her head and said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ok. I got wet just when it rained, but fortunately Ah! &quot;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I forgot to give the umbrella back to the Taoist,&rdquo; Xiaohuan stamped</p>

<p>Xiaohuan did not understand and said, &ldquo;what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gold bottle son&rsquo;s eyes flickered, as if they were cold, and said lightly: &ldquo;those two men just now are all ruthless people. When you see them in the future, you&rsquo;d better leave at once. Never get close to them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan nodded quietly, but somehow, suddenly, she felt lost. She thought of the Qingyun youth who was cheated by the immortal on Monday many years ago. (to be continued. )</p>
