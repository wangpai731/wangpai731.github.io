      <p>The heavy stone door closed behind Xiaobai with a deep voice, and at the same time isolated those noisy voices in the distance. Xiaobai&rsquo;s bright eyes swept in the room. Then it fell on the man sitting behind the desk in front of him. The man was tall, dignified and majestic. He was the king of ghosts.</p>
<p>At the moment, the ghost king also raised his eyes to Xiaobai, but he didn&rsquo;t speak. Before Xiaobai came here, he had gathered a lot of resentment in his heart, but at the moment he felt that he should not only start from he. Hum, as like as two peas, she looked at the stone room again, and then frowned slightly. A strange feeling appeared in her heart, as if the room was not right, but all the decorations around her were exactly the same as when she came here. There was no change in it. Even Xiao Bai could not tell her where it was wrong.</p>
<p>At this time, the ghost King slowly stood up and said, &ldquo;how did you suddenly come back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His voice was very low, which seemed to be different from his previous voice. However, Xiaobai had many things in mind at the moment, and did not pay more attention to it. When the ghost king asked this sentence, she sneered and said, &ldquo;so you still know I&rsquo;m back? I didn&rsquo;t come back for you anyway</p>
<p>Ghost King light way: &ldquo;Oh, then what do you do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaobai was a little impatient and said, &ldquo;I came back to look for GUI Li, but I don&rsquo;t have time to say this now. I have a lot of things to ask you&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute!&rdquo; The ghost King&rsquo;s calm face suddenly changed and interrupted Xiao Bai&rsquo;s way: &ldquo;do you mean to look for GUI Li?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaobai took a look at him, the corner of his mouth moved slightly, and said, &ldquo;what is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost King&rsquo;s face sank, and a strange light flashed in his eyes. He looked at Xiaobai for a moment. An inexplicable chill seemed to come out from his eyes. However, Xiaobai did not feel anything. Instead, he looked directly into the ghost King&rsquo;s eyes, with a hint of provocation.</p>
<p>They looked at each other for a moment. The ghost King sighed suddenly, first moved his eyes and said: &ldquo;nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaobai snorted coldly and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ask you. Since this period of time, Huqi mountain has been in a mess. Every day, some people are inexplicably crazy and hurt people, and people die miserably every day. People in the ghost King clan are in fear and self-esteem.</p>
<p>Do you know? &quot;</p>
<p>The ghost king stood with his hands down. After hearing the amazing news, his face seemed as rigid as a rock. After a while, he said faintly, &ldquo;Oh, what such a thing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaobai was so angry that he took a step and said angrily, &ldquo;as the leader of the ghost King clan, how can you be insensitive to such major events? What is your thinking in the end?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost king turned and his eyes became colder and colder. Wang Xiaozong, I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>Xiaobai was stunned, obviously did not expect the ghost king to say such words, his face more angry, their eyes in the stone room like a sharp blade, silent collision!</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how long after that, I just heard Xiaobai say word by word: &ldquo;this foundation is also my sister&rsquo;s infatuated blood. I don&rsquo;t care what madness you have, but I can&rsquo;t see you destroy it</p>
<p>&ldquo;Destroy it? Ha ha ha&hellip; &quot; The ghost King seemed to suddenly hear what the most ridiculous words, burst out laughing, and his expression was changed. From a gloomy moment to arrogant, he raised his head and roared to the sky and said, &ldquo;what do you know? It&rsquo;s because of the infatuated blood of this foundation profit that I&rsquo;ll manage with my heart. In the future, I&rsquo;ll look at my unity. If you want to dominate the world, you will know what I mean. Ha ha ha&hellip; &quot; He laughed wildly, and his expression was very different from that of the past. He was not calm at all.</p>
<p>Xiaobai can&rsquo;t help but be astonished. As a Nine Tailed Tianhu, she is kind to people, but she doesn&rsquo;t necessarily think much about human life. But seeing the ghost King&rsquo;s expression at the moment, she totally ignores the lives of countless disciples of the ghost King sect. Even in the eyes of her clan, she feels too much. Xiaobai thinks that he is really wrong to come back this time. Everyone around him seems to be going to be crazy. Those who are not crazy are almost as mad. The ghost king in front of him is also abnormal, which really makes people angry and confused.</p>
<p>Angry, Xiaobai Nu said: &ldquo;are you crazy, those people are your disciples, how can you ignore their lives?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost king was originally looking up at the sky and laughing wildly, but as soon as the words &ldquo;Crazy&rdquo; in the little vernacular came into his ears, his expression suddenly changed, his facial muscles slightly twisted, and his laughter stopped. His eyes were sharp as a knife, and he looked straight at Xiaobai.</p>
<p>The ghost king of Xiaobai machete has a sudden change in his attitude. He is shocked by his murderous spirit. Almost at the same time, because of her keen practice of the demon fox the year before last, he found another thing, which made him shake slightly and looked up at the ghost king.</p>
<p>In the stone chamber, there was a faint and strange blood in silence. Although Xiaobai didn&rsquo;t want to believe it, it was clearly from the ghost king that the strange power came out slowly!</p>
<p>！” ; you Say What Is it? &quot;</p>
<p>The ghost king stood there, staring at Xiaobai, and his voice became low again. He slowly vomited out this question from his teeth.</p>
<p>Xiaobai didn&rsquo;t answer. She just looked at the ghost king, and then the noodle merchant applied to calm down from her initial consternation and turned to be expressionless. At the end of the day, she even faintly showed some strange sarcasm in her eyes. She was silent for a long time, but she looked up and said, &ldquo;I just got impatient. Don&rsquo;t worry about what I said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This remark was unexpected to the king of ghosts, and he could not help but feel a little surprised with his calmness. However, Xiaobai said this, and the tense atmosphere outside the stone chamber suddenly relaxed, and the mysterious and bloody murderous spirit seemed to fade away.</p>
<p>Xiaobai took a deep look at the ghost king and said, &ldquo;as I said just now, I&rsquo;m here to look for the ghost calendar. Since he&rsquo;s not here, I don&rsquo;t want to stay here. I&rsquo;ll go now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost King hesitated and frowned slightly. It seemed that he had not figured out the reason why Xiaobai&rsquo;s attitude changed so much. He even hesitated to speak.</p>
<p>But Xiaobai didn&rsquo;t give the ghost King more time to consider, straight way: if you don&rsquo;t have other things, I&rsquo;ll leave now. Say body a turn stone door to walk.</p>
<p>Naturally, the stone chamber where the ghost king lived was spacious, but after all, it was built in the middle of the mountain, and it would not go anywhere again. Xiaobai was only ten steps away from the stone gate. Seeing his graceful figure walking towards the stone gate, the ghost King standing behind him suddenly changed. All kinds of complicated looks intertwined together, sometimes murderous and hesitant.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that Xiaobai doesn&rsquo;t slow down at all. Ten steps away, even if the speed is not fast, you can reach it in a twinkling of an eye. The heavy stone door slowly opened in front of her, and made a low roar. She did not look back.</p>
<p>White Lapel wrapped his slender and rich posture. The tickets are swinging gently.</p>
<p>Where does the wind come from the caves in the middle of the mountain? Behind her, in silence, she knew that the heavy door closed again, isolating her from the stone chamber. Xiaobai stood indifferently, took a deep breath, and walked slowly along the empty passage. In the process of walking, her body gradually relaxed from the tension in the dark.</p>
<p>Her eyes still had some mysterious smile, but she didn&rsquo;t know what she was thinking at the bottom of her heart. She just glanced over the open channels around her, and suddenly fell on the rough and deep cracks around her. Then, a certain sneer flashed on his face again.</p>
<p>She had already known the reason why she felt the wrong in the ghost King&rsquo;s stone room just now. There were these mysterious cracks everywhere in the ghost King Zong&rsquo;s crying. Only in the ghost King&rsquo;s stone chamber just now, the stone walls inside were different.</p>
<p>flawless and perfect!</p>
<p>The ghost calendar fell from the sky from high altitude, and the monkey little grey was lying on his shoulder. Looking around, for the active little ash, it seems that there will never be a quiet time, and the monkey&rsquo;s body, will never see the word &ldquo;tired&rdquo;.</p>
<p>However, the monkey will not be tired, but its landlord&rsquo;s face is a little heavy, the ghost fell to the ground, far away in the world towering desolate Huqi mountain, but somehow, he did not directly land in Huqi mountain Guiwang cave as usual. It fell at the foot of Huqi mountain, and then walked slowly towards the mountain. It can be seen that Gui Li&rsquo;s manner is rather dignified, and his brows are tightly locked. Maybe even he himself has forgotten how long he has not really laughed.</p>
<p>There was a slight heaviness in the chest. Ghost calendar does not need to reach out to touch, also know what it is - mysterious magic weapon heaven and earth reincarnation plate! Ghost calendar had never heard of such a magical treasure in the world before. What&rsquo;s more, Zhou Yixian, a wandering monk in the world, would know the secret even in Tianyin temple. Only after he had a little hope, he was more worried. Anxiety and confusion. Up to now, he still can&rsquo;t understand this magic weapon. Presumably, master Pude can&rsquo;t understand it for decades. How can he solve this mystery in just a few days? But what about Biyao?</p>
<p>Ghost calendar stopped and took a deep breath. His expression was like that he couldn&rsquo;t breathe under the heavy burden. After a long time, he suddenly laughed bitterly and walked up the mountain again.</p>
<p>How many people always say that life is like a dream, but do not know the world, no matter what kind of dream, also always have to face!</p>
<p>Unknowingly, he has come to the entrance of the cave of the guiwangzong hall.</p>
<p>Several disciples on duty patrol at the gate were surprised to see his figure. Then they seemed to think of something. Their faces were full of joy and all ran over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vice Lord, you are back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You came back a little late. Little white girl came back to look for you and just left!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t come back, we, we really don&rsquo;t know if we can live to see you&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A stack of voices, disorderly speech, but let the ghost calendar was surprised, stunned: &ldquo;what do you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the disciples of the ghost King sect have been trapped in a sea of fire and suffering. However, under such circumstances, all the people in charge of the affairs in the past have disappeared. The Four Saints&rsquo; envoys had great prestige. However, after Qinglong went to the south of Xinjiang, there was no news from Qinglong. For a long time, Zhuque left Huqi mountain. The ghost king, as the center of the ghost King clan, has a totally unexpected and uncanny attitude. The ghost King clan is really in a mess. If it is not for the strict rules of the demon sect, people are really afraid of punishment and dare not flee. Otherwise, Huqi mountain will become an empty mountain.</p>
<p>In the past, GUI Li had a high status in the Guiwang sect. Although he was usually cold-blooded, he never bullied ordinary GUI Wang sect disciples. Many ghost King sect disciples secretly respected the silent vice patriarch. here</p>
<p>At this moment, when we are in danger, we suddenly see the ghost calendar, which is like a life-saving straw to send carbon in the snow. How can we not make these people who are immersed in and unable to extricate themselves from their fear with ecstasy.</p>
<p>Listening to these disciples around you, I kept talking, ghost calendar silently lowered his head, reached out and gently touched his chest, the heaven and earth samsara plate through the black cloth. Faint and warm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enough!&rdquo; Suddenly, he said so coldly.</p>
<p>All the disciples of the ghost King clan were stunned.</p>
<p>GUI Li pushed away the disciples of the ghost King sect silently and walked towards the mountainside.</p>
<p>Deep, someone called out: &ldquo;deputy, vice Lord, don&rsquo;t even you, even you don&rsquo;t care about us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fierce body stopped for a moment.</p>
<p>Then he only listened to his deep and repressed voice and said slowly: &ldquo;for ten years, I have tried my best to cure Biyao. I even despise myself, and how can I save others&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He walked on and on, looking from behind, he was a bit desolate. He didn&rsquo;t have the youthful vigor he should have at the moment. After him, the disciples of the ghost King clan looked at each other, and everyone looked as if they were dead, and despair was like a tide. They came from all directions of the unknown and covered them up.</p>
<p>GUI Li walked into the corridor in the middle of the mountain. He didn&rsquo;t take two steps. Suddenly, Xiaohui, a monkey lying on his shoulder, suddenly shook his body At the same time, three people in the middle of the room stood up and screamed. It was as if he were facing a great enemy.</p>
<p>Ghost Li eyebrow a wrinkle, reach out to embrace small ash to come down, low voice asks a way: &ldquo;small ash, how?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohui made a few squeaks and squeaks, and his expression was slightly nervous. At the same time, he waved his arms to both sides, and his eyes were fixed. Then he looked along the direction of Xiaohui&rsquo;s fingers, and his face gradually turned cold.</p>
<p>Small gray fingers of the place, is the original hard stone wall. There are many strange and deep mysterious cracks.</p>
<p>GUI Li slowly put the small ash back on his shoulder, and at the same time, he started to walk forward slowly. Xiao Hui lies on the shoulder of the ghost, three eyes wide open. A look of vigilance, carefully observed around. This corridor, which used to be crowded with people, only ghosts and small ashes are visible at the moment. All the disciples of the ghost King clan are missing.</p>
<p>Empty corridor, one after another of the forks, with the ghost calendar body slowly moving. The mysterious cracks on the stone walls on both sides of the corridor are more and more dense and thick. A strange breath, began to diffuse in the channels around the ghost calendar, like invisible, what monsters opened their eyes in the dark, staring at them.</p>
<p>If there is no, faint smell of blood, you drift in the open corridor.</p>
<p>Ghost calendar walk more and more slowly, his eyes from a crack to another crack, also become more and more deep and sharp, here, is really what happened!</p>
<p>He suddenly stopped, as if he remembered something. For a moment, his face was pale. This strange unknown power covered Huqi mountain, while Biyao was still lying in the cold stone room stretching out of the corridor</p>
<p>In a moment, ghost Li&rsquo;s figure bounced out like lightning, and even made a sharp sound of breaking the sky in the quiet corridor, and disappeared at the end of the corridor in an instant.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The sound of the heavy stone door echoed again in the corridor. Ghost Li stood anxiously at the door of the cold stone room. Almost at the opening of the stone door, he had already snatched in.</p>
<p>The white smoke, like a dream, still emanates from the cold stone platform, floating in the half sky of the stone chamber. A green figure, with a light and quiet smile, still lies there quietly.</p>
<p>Ghost calendar stood at the door in silence, after half a sound, just a long breath, the tension on the face slowly calmed down.</p>
<p>He looked at Biyao for a long time, slowly walked up, came to the side of the ice stone platform, looked at the beautiful woman who was still as beautiful as before for a long time, and whispered, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m back, Biyao.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no answer. The answer to him was a cold silence. The corners of the ghost calendar&rsquo;s mouth moved slightly, and a trace of sadness flashed through his eyes.</p>
<p>He sat down beside the ice stone platform and looked around. He found that the cold stone room was somehow different from the cracks in the corridors outside. The surrounding stone walls were in perfect condition without any cracks.</p>
<p>Ghost Li slightly frowned, and his eyes were puzzled. But at the moment, he didn&rsquo;t seem to be in the mood to explore anything. Soon, his attention and eyes were focused on the Biyao lying on the ice stone platform. He slowly unwrapped the black cloth and revealed the gentle color of the samsara plate. The white and soft light radiated out, passing over the pale face of Biyao.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Biyao&hellip;&rdquo; Ghost calendar gently called out.</p>
<p>But before he could continue to say something, suddenly behind him came a cold and majestic voice at the entrance of the stone chamber.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ghost Li eyebrows a frown, turn to look at the door.</p>
<p>I saw the ghost King standing at the stone gate, his eyes sharp as a knife, staring at the heaven and earth samsara plate in the ghost calendar&rsquo;s hand, coldly said: &ldquo;what&rsquo;s in your hand?&rdquo; (to be continued. )</p>
