      <p>The ancestral hall of Qingyun Mountain is still shrouded in the pines and cypresses, and the huge figure looms. However, this silence was soon broken by the chaotic steps. A large group of people under the Qingyun gate rushed to this holy land for worshiping the ancestors of Qingyun ancestors.</p>
<p>From the appearance, it seems that everything is still as quiet as before. But before we get to the hall of the ancestral hall, both the confused disciples of Tongtian peak and the anxious Su Ru stop for it.</p>
<p>Surrounded by pines and cypresses, the ancestral hall is solemn and solemn. At the moment, there are broken wood and debris everywhere, which is in a state of chaos.</p>
<p>At the huge gate of the ancestral hall, the original red lacquer gate was smashed. Even the appearance of the door was hard to see. In front of the public, it was just a more huge and piercing grotto.</p>
<p>On the outer wall of the ancestral temple, almost all the windows were shaken down, and countless holes, large or small, appeared on the wall. The solemn ancestral hall was full of holes, which was terrible. Only the darkness in the ancestral hall seemed to ignore the dim light from the falling windows and countless holes, and diffused gently in the ancestral hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not easy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru was the first to react, but she didn&rsquo;t care why the ancestral temple had been changed. She rushed in, hoping to see the people she wanted to see. Master Shuiyue and elder Yang, elder fan and others also followed.</p>
<p>In the ancestral hall, it seems that it was also the same as the outside. All the once severe weather conditions were destroyed, the flat stone slabs were broken, and the huge glass oil bottles were also broken. Even when people came to the most sacred place, after the huge sacrificial table which was split into two parts, the countless spiritual tablets of the ancestors of Qingyun gate, which were worshipped, were scattered all over the ground. At a glance, I don&rsquo;t know how many magic cards have been forcibly beaten into two halves or even more by some mysterious power.</p>
<p>However, in addition to the mess of the whole land, people actually could not see a person.</p>
<p>Su Ru looks pale. The body is crumbling, master Shuiyue frowns tightly, steps on a step and hugs her in his arms. After a few words of consolation in a low voice, he turned to Xiao Yi, who was following the crowd. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on here? What&rsquo;s the matter with elder martial brother daoxuan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai&rsquo;s face was bitter, and even now her surprised look has not faded. He said: &ldquo;report to martial uncle, as soon as I came here, I saw this scene.</p>
<p>As for the master, he has been meditating in the ancestral hall almost every day for a month. I can&rsquo;t imagine where his old man will go except here</p>
<p>In the eyes of master Shuiyue, the color of worry is getting more and more serious. It is at this moment that he wants to stop talking. All of a sudden, a light noise came from the side. All the people present were people of high moral character, and almost immediately all heard it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone.&rdquo; Elder Yang quickly judged that the voice came from the back of the interrupted huge altar.</p>
<p>Su Ru, who was weak in the whole body, suddenly startled. A glimmer of joy flashed in her eyes. She stood up straight and cried, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not easy. Is it you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A disciple ran past and opened the table together. I don&rsquo;t know which generation of ancestors passed it down. It&rsquo;s huge and thick. It was extremely heavy. Although the disciples had some Taoism, they had to work together to open the table.</p>
<p>After opening. Sure enough, there was a figure under the debris, and a low voice came out at the same time.</p>
<p>The crowd was overjoyed and surrounded, but a moment later, they were stunned again. They saw that this man was not easy. It&rsquo;s not the Taoist priest of Qingyun sect, but Lin Jingyu, a disciple of longshoufeng who has been guarding the spirit in the ancestral hall.</p>
<p>Half of his body and clothes were red with blood, and he was obviously injured. His face was very pale and seemed to be in a coma. He did not respond to the people kneeling beside him calling him at the moment.</p>
<p>Su Ru&rsquo;s joy gradually disappeared, and was replaced by greater worry and anxiety. Master Shuiyue stood by her side and comforted with soft voice. Elder Yang looks pale and looks around. The ancestral hall of Qingyun gate is one of the most important places in Qingyun gate, which can be compared with the magic moon cave. It&rsquo;s really something that has never happened in a thousand years. What&rsquo;s more, the two most important people in Qingyun gate seem to have disappeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nephew Xiao,&rdquo; elder Yang turned to Xiao Yicai and said, &ldquo;are you sure the leader is here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Yi looked at the unconscious Lin Jingyu. Her face calmed down and pondered for a moment. She said, &ldquo;yes, since these days, my master is really only in this ancestral hall. It is here that the disciples ask for advice and report back to his old man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elder Yang was obviously upset and didn&rsquo;t know what to do for a while.</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai coughed twice and approached elder Yang slowly. He lowered his voice and said in a low voice: &ldquo;Uncle Yang, it&rsquo;s not appropriate to delay this matter. So many younger martial brothers gather here to see the damage to the Holy Land and ancestral hall, which is harmful and unhelpful. What&rsquo;s more, according to Su Ru, uncle Su&rsquo;s teacher is not easy with the field in dazhufeng. He seems to have a secret feeling. I&rsquo;m afraid it may have something to do with what happened here. Why don&rsquo;t we let them quit first and make a decision again? &quot;</p>
<p>Elder Yang woke up, nodded his head, and then said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how to do these things. The headmaster and elder martial brother always believe in you, and you take care of everything on weekdays. Now you can make a decision at the moment.&rdquo; After that, he shook his head and sighed, and went to one side to discuss with the elder Baihu Zifan in a low voice.</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai nodded to elder Yang, which was taken as an order. Then he turned around and said in a loud voice: &ldquo;martial uncles, younger martial brothers, the ancestral hall has been in great trouble recently. I&rsquo;m afraid there is an invasion of foreign enemies. I&rsquo;ve just come here. As the saying goes, we can&rsquo;t wait to be killed. &ldquo;He raised his eyebrows and said to Zhongyi, a disciple of tongtianfeng:&rdquo; younger martial brother Qin, you should take ten people with you to guard the outside of the ancestral temple immediately. No one is allowed to come in. In case there are enemies hiding in this, you should report to me as soon as you find out. &quot;</p>
<p>Tongtianfeng disciples out of a tall man, arch hand Su Rong way: &ldquo;yes.&rdquo; After that, he went back to say hello to the left and right, and even index people immediately walked out.</p>
<p>At the moment, the ancestral hall is quiet. Only Xiao Yicai is standing in the middle. Although there are several elders who are higher than him, at this moment, it seems that he is the backbone of Qingyun gate.</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai said again, &ldquo;younger brother Chang!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; A man with a firm face walked out with the sound. However, he had taken Zhang Xiaofan and others to the mountain to meet martial arts, and had a battle with song Daren, the eldest disciple of dazhufeng.</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai nodded. He said: &ldquo;younger martial brother Chang, the most important thing at present is to find a mentor who will take charge of the overall situation. I&rsquo;m not afraid of anything. Although there seems to be a big event here, but the master&rsquo;s way of communication with God, the world is invincible, ordinary demons must not infringe on him. You take 80 people No, the more people, the better. You take 150. From the top to the bottom of Tongtian peak, you have to look for the front and back of the mountain. You can&rsquo;t miss the slightest clue. &quot;</p>
<p>Chang Jian&rsquo;s face was deeply worried. Obviously, he knew that although Xiao Yicai had said something good in front of him, the most important thing was the last sentence. He did not hesitate at the moment. After answering in a deep voice, he quickly called on the people and went out. It is obvious that the number of people is not enough. Most of them have to go to the front mountain to deploy troops.</p>
<p>As soon as this large group of people left. At that time, the ancestral hall was obviously empty. There were only a few senior figures and Xiao Yicai, and Wen Min who followed master Shuiyue. Finally, Lin Jingyu was still in a coma.</p>
<p>With a sigh, Xiao Yicai turned and saluted the elders. He said in a low voice, &ldquo;martial uncles, there are great changes in Qingyun gate today. My disciples are arbitrary in making decisions. If there is something wrong, please punish them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru and master Shuiyue did not speak. Elder Yang nodded and said, &ldquo;nephew Xiao, you don&rsquo;t have to be humble. You did a good job just now. Now we don&rsquo;t have to do anything else. You can just tell me. You&rsquo;re welcome. &quot;</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai pondered for a moment and said, &ldquo;now that the situation is not clear, we still need to be careful. Please go back to their respective mountains. If there is a contingency, it is also good for their respective portal vein care. It&rsquo;s a pity that younger martial brother Lin of longshoufeng is still in a coma. Otherwise, we will know everything by asking him. After all, he was the only one present at that time. &quot;</p>
<p>All of them frowned together. All of them were worried. Su Ru was comforted by master Shuiyue. After all, Tian was not easy and her figure was not there. Although she was worried, there was hope in the end, so she was not so nervous. Listening to Xiao Yicai&rsquo;s dispatch all the way, she was in a state of confusion, and only hoped that the field would not be in trouble.</p>
<p>At this time, she glanced at Lin Jingyu lying on the ground. Suddenly, she frowned and whispered: &ldquo;eh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue stood beside her and said in dismay, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru pointed to Lin Jingyu and said, &ldquo;what seems to be on his hand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everyone was surprised. Xiao Yi quickly walked to Lin Jingyu and turned him over. Sure enough, he was pressed in his right hand, holding a rectangular black board tightly. Xiao Yicai reaches out to get it. Unexpectedly, as soon as he pulls it out, the board doesn&rsquo;t move. Although Lin Jingyu is in a coma, he somehow grabs the board tightly and never relaxes.</p>
<p>All of them were puzzled.</p>
<p>Elder fan went to one side and turned around. Suddenly he said, &ldquo;this board seems to be the spirit card of the ancestor worshipped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue fixed his eyes and nodded: &ldquo;yes, it&rsquo;s a magic card.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Yi took a long time to break off Lin Jingyu&rsquo;s tightly held fingers and took out the magic card which seemed to be extremely important to him. Everyone gathered around. As a witness to the incident, Lin Jingyu cared so much about the trump, which obviously had something to do with it. Unexpectedly, all of them were shocked and looked at each other.</p>
<p>Although this trump is the same size as other trumps and is also painted black, there is no word on it.</p>
<p>This is a magic card without words!</p>
<p>Who is the spiritual throne it worships in this solemn ancestral hall?</p>
<p>Who put it to enjoy incense with the ancestors of all ages? Since it was put on it, why didn&rsquo;t it write its name?</p>
<p>What does it mean for Lin Jingyu to hold on to this wooden card and refuse to let go after being seriously injured and unconscious?</p>
<p>All kinds of doubts, a myriad of thoughts, seem to linger in the hearts of all people.</p>
<p>South Xinjiang, 100000 mountains, Zhenmo ancient cave.</p>
<p>Legend is a very strange thing. First of all, the legend itself does not seem to be a reliable meaning, just because some things seem to have a reason to pass on, people will pass it on from mouth to mouth, or some scholars will take notes and pass them down. Secondly, the longer the legend spreads, the more often the legend itself will gradually change, and the people and things in those days will gradually become completely different. In countless people&rsquo;s embellishment and time, who still remember the truth of that year?</p>
<p>Who cares?</p>
<p>So the legend finally became a legend, just like that beautiful and gentle woman, slowly changed her face in the time.</p>
<p>Thousands of years later. Can you still recognize each other?</p>
<p>In the dark, the Yin wind seems to be still, rampant, and just belongs to the world outside the ancient cave, and in this dark world. Everything is quiet.</p>
<p>This is the deepest place of Zhenmo ancient cave. It was here that black wood took the sacred utensils of the five nationalities in southern Xinjiang and resurrected the animal gods. But today, the once boiling and surging evil spirit has disappeared, leaving only quiet, and the occasional low breath.</p>
<p>It was a gasp. From the deepest darkness came a little strange red light, and then it shone in the dark and nihilistic space.</p>
<p>A low growl. All of a sudden, in the dark, where the wheezing came out, it sounded like a fierce beast with strong uneasiness and even some recognizable fear. He bared his teeth and angrily pointed at the red light.</p>
<p>The low panting stopped, as if something had soothed the beast in the dark. The roar gradually went down, and finally disappeared, and silence returned to the cave. Only that strange dark red fire, still flickering, non-stop flashing.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a woman&rsquo;s voice. Yue&rsquo;er, however, seems to have no feelings. It echoes faintly in the cave: &ldquo;your gluttonous food seems to have no good feelings for me all the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The space where the darkness is located seems to be really large. The voice of the woman seems to have spread far away. Floating around, empty, just listen to the source of the voice, it is in the dark red light behind.</p>
<p>In response, there was a quiet laugh. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to care. It never believed in humans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman snorted and said, &ldquo;why, has it regarded me as a human being?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roar&rdquo;, a low roar, passed in the air in an instant. In front of the dark red light, a group of flames suddenly lit up. It turned out to be a primitive form of brazier, tripod support, rusty. I don&rsquo;t know how many years ago, but the fire burned in this brazier, and the flame was still so bright, just like the clothes after the flame.</p>
<p>Bright, silk clothes.</p>
<p>Beast God!</p>
<p>He sat on the ground between the fire and the shadow of darkness, leaning against the stone wall of a platform. The flame flashed, and his face was bright and dark. He still had a strange feeling of enchantment. However, unlike when he was just born again, his face was extremely pale, and it was not too much to say that his face was as pale as death.</p>
<p>In the light of the fire, it was the ferocious beast named Taotie, who was close to him and nestled next to him. At the moment, Taotie&rsquo;s huge eyes were wide open, his mouth was slightly grinning, and his mouth seemed to be gasping. He fiercely passed through the fire of the brazier in front of him, staring at the dark red light which had become invisible in the distance.</p>
<p>Although the beast God&rsquo;s face is not good-looking, his expression is very calm. He even has a faint smile around his mouth and says, &ldquo;you have been practicing Taoism for thousands of years. You want to be a man. I say you like that. You should be happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman&rsquo;s voice was silent. She did not speak for a moment, but the dark red light suddenly lit up.</p>
<p>Taotie seemed to be alert at once. He roared and stared at the dark red light.</p>
<p>The light of the fire moved slowly, and the direction was the place where the God of the beast was. Taotie&rsquo;s face was more ferocious, and he slowly stood up. Suddenly, a hand extended from the side, gently patted Taotie&rsquo;s head, which slowly quieted down.</p>
<p>The beast God took back his hand and looked back. The light of the fire was slowly flying in front of him. It was like an eye. It was not far away from him. He was staring at him.</p>
<p>The beast God looked at the dark red light for a long time, and suddenly said with a smile, &ldquo;you and I have been friends for thousands of years. Although we can&rsquo;t say that we are friends, we are old friends! Besides, I am seriously injured at the moment. How can you be so alert to me? &quot;</p>
<p>The dark red fire flickered for several times, and suddenly gave out a sharp scream, and quickly and incomparably retreated back. When it passed over the brazier, it even suppressed the flame in the brazier, and the surrounding was suddenly dark. After a while, it returned to normal again. At this time, the dark red fire had disappeared in the dark.</p>
<p>The woman&rsquo;s cold voice rang at the same time, and said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you, just like your glutton doesn&rsquo;t believe me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Looking at the darkness ahead, the beast god suddenly burst out with a loud smile, &ldquo;good, good, good, good. But I don&rsquo;t understand why you want to help me now that you and I have no mutual trust? &quot;</p>
<p>The woman&rsquo;s voice light way: &ldquo;because I want things, now only you can give me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just because of this, these ugly images carved on the stone walls and on the ground?&rdquo; the beast God said with a smile</p>
<p>He waved his hand. Although the smile was still there, the weariness on his face seemed to be deeper.</p>
<p>The fire in the brazier, suddenly rising and making a crackling sound, was actually several times larger than the original. For a time, it was full of light, and the surrounding temperature was rapidly becoming intolerable and blazing. However, no matter the animal God or the gluttonous, or the mysterious figure still hidden in the shadow of darkness, did not respond to these.</p>
<p>The flame was burning and spreading slowly in the dark, as if life was gradually coming into being. Even the shape in the fire light began to expand and change slowly, gradually growing from a mass to a faint dragon.</p>
<p>In the dark, gazing at the shape of the gradually forming dragon, the woman&rsquo;s voice slowly said, &ldquo;I remember it&rsquo;s these ugly images that trapped you for countless years, right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The beast God smiles, but in the fire, he can&rsquo;t tell whether he is a bitter smile, a sneer, or a sneer</p>
<p>Because at the moment of his smile, the fire dragon above the brazier had already taken shape. It opened its teeth and claws in the fire. It suddenly raised its head to the darkness and gave out a silent roar.</p>
<p>Almost at the same time, the blazing heat wave surged like a torrent, rushing around in an instant and rolling, destroying everything in front of it. After the sea of fire, in the blazing fire, four patterns were lit up one by one around the basin. The lines were broad and the color was blood red. There were four different ferocious and ferocious gods in the paintings. A moment later, four stone carvings with patterns were also lit up on the top of the fire pot and on the left and right stone walls, which were similar in content.</p>
<p>These eight carved patterns as like as two peas in the burning altar.</p>
<p>Eight fierce XuanHuo array! (to be continued. )</p>
