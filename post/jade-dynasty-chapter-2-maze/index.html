      <p>The old monk didn&rsquo;t answer, only looked at the two children with his eyes, but couldn&rsquo;t help but looked at Lin Jingyu a few more times, and said, &ldquo;Good qualification, but why is the temperament so extreme?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this time Zhang Xiaofan took a step and said, &ldquo;Hey, who are you, how have you never seen you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cao Miao Village is near Qingyun Gate, where Taoism is revered, and Buddhist disciples are extremely rare, so Zhang Xiaofan has this question.</p>
<p>The old monk glanced at him with a smile on the corner of his mouth, and asked: &ldquo;Little donor, you just passed on life, you just have to admit defeat, why do you have to work hard, if the old gang shot, you are afraid that it has been sent in vain. life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan froze for a while, and thought in his heart that the old monk said it was justified and unreasonable, but when things were about to come, he still couldn&rsquo;t tell why, and he had to be there.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu glared at the old monk and took Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s hand and said, &ldquo;Xiaofan, this old monk is weird, we don&rsquo;t care about him.&rdquo; Then he pulled him out and several children followed It is clear that he has always followed his lead.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan also unconsciously took steps, but after he walked out of the temple door for a while, he couldn&rsquo;t help but looked back at the temple, only to see that the sky was getting darker, and he could vaguely see that the old monk was still standing there, but his face was blurred. Cleared.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Late at night.</p>
<p>There was a thunder, the wind lingered in the clouds, and the dark clouds rolled in the sky.</p>
<p>The wind and rain are about to come.</p>
<p>The old monk was still in the grass temple, meditating on the floor. Looking up, there was only a hazy distance in the distant Qingyun Mountain. There was no voice in Shiye, and there was only the squally wind and thunder.</p>
<p>What a gale!</p>
<p>A flash of lightning passed through the sky. This little grass temple standing alone in the wind lit up. I saw that the old monk had stood at the gate of the temple in this moment. His face was serious. Looking up at the sky, his brows became wrinkled. The tighter.</p>
<p>In some villages in the west, there was no time when there was a black qi, thick like black ink, and it kept flowing. The old monk stood in the grass temple and stared at the black air.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the black gas rolled up, hovered, and went straight out of the village, coming in the direction of Cao Temple. It&rsquo;s extremely fast, and it&rsquo;s almost instant. The old monk&rsquo;s eyes were sharp, and he saw that there was a child in it, which was Lin Jingyu who had seen him during the day.</p>
<p>The old monk&rsquo;s face sank, and he didn&rsquo;t hesitate anymore, and he didn&rsquo;t see how he was doing. His thin body rose up horribly, and he inserted straight into the black air.</p>
<p>An unknown voice came from the unknown place in the darkness: &ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few muffled sounds, the black gas stopped arrogantly, hovering over the Cao Temple. The old monk sandwiched Lin Jingyu under his ribs, and slowly fell, but a piece of the cassock has been torn off behind him.</p>
<p>Through the faint light, Lin Jingyu&rsquo;s eyes were closed, his breathing was steady, and he didn&rsquo;t know whether he fell asleep or passed out.</p>
<p>The old monk did not put him down, looked up at the black air in the air, and said, &ldquo;Your Excellency is so deep, why do you start with ignorant children, just afraid of losing your identity?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A hoarse voice came from the black air, saying: &ldquo;Who are you, dare to take care of my business?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old monk did not answer, but said: &ldquo;This is under the Qingyun Mountain. If Qingyun Gate knows that you are doing something wrong here, I am afraid that your future will not be good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man yucked, disdainful, and said: &ldquo;What is the Qingyun Gate, it&rsquo;s just relying on the number of people. The old bald donkey shouldn&rsquo;t say more, and the wise man will quickly give me the child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old monk said ten things together: &ldquo;Buddha Amitabha, the family is compassionate, and Lao Qun can&rsquo;t just watch this kid being hit by you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man said angrily: &ldquo;Good thief is bald, you are looking for death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Along with his words, a dark red awn flashed in the black air that had been circling, and suddenly the wind around the little grass temple was overwhelmed by the wind and the ghost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poisonous blood streamer!&rdquo; The old monk&rsquo;s face burst into anger, &ldquo;Sin obstacles, you dare to practice such evil things that have lost the conscience and harmed the world, and today I can&rsquo;t spare you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hoarse voice sneered, but did not answer, but only heard a roar, Hongmangsheng, from the midair, the stench of gas made a great deal, and the red streamer slowly sacrificed on both sides. At this time, the sound of ghost crying became more and more fierce, and there seemed to be countless wraiths crying at night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The thief is bald, die!&rdquo; The man in the black gas stopped drinking, and he saw a grimace above the bloody red streamer, with triangular eyes, fangs, and fangs. &ldquo;K, K, K, K&rdquo; bones At the chaos, all four eyes on the ghost&rsquo;s face were suddenly opened, and with a roar, they turned into entities, rushed out of the streamer, and struck the old monk with a bloody gas.</p>
<p>The old monk&rsquo;s face was more angry, knowing that the more powerful the blood streamer was, the more innocent people who would have been killed during the cultivation process. To make such a powerful presence in front of you, I am afraid that it is only necessary to sacrifice the streamer with more than 300 people.</p>
<p>This wicked man is truly utterly conscience!</p>
<p>Seeing that the ghost was about to hit the eyes, the old monk did not put down the child Lin Jingyu under the ribs. Instead, he used his left hand holding the jasper rosary to draw a circle in front of him in the void, with one hand forming a Buddhist lion seal, five fingers bent, fingers hidden There was a golden light, and in a moment a golden *** was greeted in front of him. The golden light was brilliant, and he resisted the ghost in the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Small tricks, come here to sell&hellip;&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t finish the word &ldquo;getting&rdquo;, and suddenly his body was shocked, only to feel that his right hand was holding the child Lin Jingyu, and his wrist was bitten by a foreign body. Itching felt like he was walking all over his body immediately, his eyes were black, and his body was crumbling.</p>
<p>But at this moment, the ghost in front had a strange change. On its forehead in the middle of its four left and right eyes, there were two clicks of &ldquo;click, click&rdquo;, and a blood-red giant eye was opened again. The wind was strong and the power was even heavier. Hearing a ghost howl, the bloody red light flashed over, and the ghost smashed the golden *** to the old monk&rsquo;s chest.</p>
<p>The old monk was beaten and flew backwards, and Lin Jingyu under the ribs also fell to the ground. There were several muffled noises on the way, fearing that the ribs had been broken. A moment later, his skinny body hit the wall of the Cao Temple, and there was a bang, the dust was flying, and the whole wall collapsed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hahahahaha~~~~~~~~&rdquo; The black man burst into laughter with great pride.</p>
<p>The old monk stood up tremblingly, his throat heated, and he couldn&rsquo;t help but a spit of blood spewing out, staining the monk&rsquo;s clothes in front of him. He only felt that Venus was shining in front of him, his body was sore and the tingling sensation approached his heart more and more.</p>
<p>He calmed his mind and swept the corner of Lin Jingyu who fell into a coma on the ground, but when he saw him in his shirt, he slowly crawled out of a colorful centipede, which was as big as a palm. Fork, it looks like it has seven tails. And each one is the same color, different, colorful, but the beauty is a bit scary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seven-tailed centipede!&rdquo; The old monk&rsquo;s words sounded like a moan.</p>
<p>The black gas on his face was getting heavier, and the corners of his mouth were constantly bleeding. It seemed to be difficult to support, but he still supported it unwilling to fall. He looked at the dark air in the air and said: &ldquo;You put this world&rsquo;s strange poison on the child, and you deliberately hide the strength, seeing the opportunity to hit me, are you coming for me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The black man sneered, &ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; and said, &ldquo;Yes, I came specifically for your witless donkey. If not, it would not be easy to deal with you as a Buddhist monk in Tianyin Temple. Well, Now quickly hand over the&rsquo;Blood Beads&rsquo;, and I will give you the antidote for the seven-tailed centipede to spare you from death!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pu Zhi smirked and said, &ldquo;There is a word &ldquo;Chi&rdquo; in my name. I can&rsquo;t think of the truth about you making this poisonous blood streamer. How could you not be greedy for the &ldquo;Blood Bead&rdquo;.&rdquo; Tao: &ldquo;It is delusion to ask me to give you the most fierce thing in this world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man in the black air was furious: &ldquo;Then you will see your Buddha.&rdquo; Red Mang flashed, the poison blood streamer swayed in the wind, the ghost cried, the giant ghost reappeared, circling slightly in the air, and rushed towards Pu Zhi again.</p>
<p>Pu Zhi shouted loudly, his clothes roared without wind, and his thin body seemed to have grown a lot. He used force on his left hand and only heard a crisp sound. The string of jasper rosary beads had been cut off for him. A dozen crystal clear rosary beads did not fall. Instead, they kept turning around, emitting blue light one by one, floating in Puzhi In front of him, only the deep purple round ball fell straight.</p>
<p>Pu Zhi flipped his palm and grabbed the deep purple beads in his hands. His hands were tied to the left and right water bottles. His eyes were wide open, and there was a golden light hidden all over his body. The words in his mouth read, &ldquo;Oh, what, what, pit, Mi, Moo!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Six-character Daming Mantra.&rdquo; The tone of the person in the black breath immediately became more dignified.</p>
<p>With the sound of Pu Zhi&rsquo;s &ldquo;moo&rdquo; falling, all the jasper rosaries shone brightly at the same moment. At the same time, the ghost sacrificed by the evil man had rushed to the front, and the bloody breath came. But as soon as he came into contact with the jade blue light, he suddenly became invisible and could not move forward, so he stalemate in the air.</p>
<p>Rao is so, Pu Zhi&rsquo;s body is shaking again, the seven-tailed centipede is the world&rsquo;s most poisonous thing, and with his hundreds of years of practice, it is still difficult to resist. It was only his dark face, but a faint smile on his face, which was a bit awe-inspiring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pu Zhi shouted loudly, like a roar of a lion, and it shook the world. The jasper rosary in front of him was driven by the Buddha’s power, and the light was more powerful. Suddenly, a rosary shattered and became a “Buddha” in midair. Words, rushed forward, hit the ghost&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow&hellip; Yeah!&rdquo; The ghost shouted screamingly and took a few steps back suddenly. His whole body fell into a deep recession, obviously injured. The angry person said angrily, &ldquo;What a bald donkey!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was about to move, only to say that it was going to happen sooner or later, and for a moment, seven or eight rosary beads made the Buddha&rsquo;s mantra hit the ghost. The ghost kept howling, retreating again and again, making a fear. When it was hit by the ninth jasper rosary, it finally howled, its five eyes were all cracked, the bones were chaosing, and it fell to the ground with a bang, struggling for a few The next time, it will be stiff, slowly turning into blood water, very smelly.</p>
<p>At the same time, Pu Zhi “wows” and spit out a large blood, and the color of the blood has become black.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; screamed, and came from the door of Caomiao at the critical moment of the two masters&rsquo; fighting methods.</p>
<p>Both Pu Zhi and the evil man were taken aback, and the sky was black, and Pu Zhi also looked at the door at the same time. I saw Zhang Xiaofan, the child I saw during the day, somehow standing before the grass temple and standing in the door, looking dumbfounded. This strange sight in the temple.</p>
<p>The man in the black air snorted coldly, but he didn&rsquo;t see how to move. The seven-tailed centipede, which had originally crawled on Lin Jingyu&rsquo;s body, suddenly flicked its tail, flew by the momentum, and flew like a lightning, and flew towards that little fan.</p>
<p>Pu Zhi&rsquo;s eyebrows were raised, one finger in his right hand, and a jasper rosary rushed in. The seven-tailed centipede seemed to be psychic, knowing how powerful it was, and not daring to resist it. The tail fluttered like a wing, and flew into the black air without sound.</p>
<p>The dark man was grotesquely said: &ldquo;Hey, I really deserve to be the four great monks of Tianyin Temple. Under severe injuries, I can also break my &ldquo;Blood Corpse King&rdquo;, but you receive a blow from the corpse king and hit the seven-tailed centipede. Poison, how long can it last? Or obediently give me the &ldquo;Blood Bead&rdquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment, Pu Zhi even began to shed black blood in the corners of his eyes, smirked, and hissed, &ldquo;If Lao Qiao died here today, he would have to remove you as a demon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as the words fell, all the jasper beads in front of him lit up at the same time, and the man in the air was immediately alert, and suddenly there was a roar, and a flash of blue light hit the black gas from behind, but it was the one that hit the seven-tailed centipede just now. The jasper rosary flew out for a while in the air, and was secretly controlled by Pu Zhi, folded behind the black gas, and burst into trouble.</p>
<p>Hearing only a roar in the black air, the man was obviously caught off guard. Several bangs, bangs, and bangs made a loud noise. The green mans flashed, and the black air was scattered, and eventually spread out, becoming invisible. A tall and thin person slowly fell from midair, his whole body was tightly wrapped in black robes, he could not see the age of appearance, only a pair of eyes, gleaming fierce light, and behind him, a long sword was tied.</p>
<p>Pu Zhi whispered: &ldquo;How do you dare not see people like you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fierce light flashed in the eyes of the man in black, and said sharply: &ldquo;Bald donkey, let you die without a burial place today!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having said that, he pulled out the long sword behind his back with a &ldquo;swipe&rdquo; and saw that the sword was as clear as autumn water, bright and not dazzling, with a touch of light, attached to it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good sword.&rdquo; Pu Zhi couldn&rsquo;t help but screamed.</p>
<p>The man in black hummed, holding a sword tactic in his hand, stepping on seven stars, walking seven steps in a row, long sword Huo Ran stabs the sky, with words in his mouth:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nine Heavens Xuansha turned into a thunder.</p>
<p>Huang Huang Tianwei, lead it with a sword! &quot;</p>
<p>For a moment, the sky clouds suddenly surging, thunder thundered, the edge of the black cloud was constantly flashing with electricity, and there was a killing between the world and the wind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sword Sword Yulei Real Skills!&rdquo; Pu Zhi&rsquo;s face was pale and gray in an instant, followed by a surprise, a trace of despair and a little inexplicable fanaticism.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are under the Qingyun Gate!&rdquo;</p>
<p>///////////////////////////////////////////////</p>
<p>PS:</p>
<p>The words &ldquo;Xi, Ma, Ni, Biao, Mi, Moo!&rdquo; recited by Pu Zhi in the text, are known as the &ldquo;Six-character Daming Mantra&rdquo;, also known as the &ldquo;Quan Yin inspiration mantra&rdquo; in Buddhist classics. The Buddhist Sutra contains: This mantra is universal, the recitation can take off the dust, refresh the heart mirror, and reach the state of great joy and bliss.

<p>Nà lǎo sēng bù dá, zhǐ yòng mùguāng zài zhè liǎng gè xiǎohái shēnshang xì xì kànle kàn, rěn bù zhù biàn duō kànle lín jīng yǔ jǐ yǎn, xīn dào:“Hǎo zīzhì, zhǐshì xìngzi zěnme què rúcǐ piānjī?”</p>
