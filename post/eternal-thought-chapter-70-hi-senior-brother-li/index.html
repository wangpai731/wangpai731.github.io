      <p>Qingfeng mountain near the top of the mountain, there is a separate path, the end of the road, there is a pool, in which there are gold fish swimming.</p>
<p>Beside the water pool is a cave. It has a single door and a single courtyard. It is very quiet and full of aura, far more than other residences.</p>
<p>At the moment, by the pool, a young man was sitting. He was dressed in the long clothes of his disciples. He was beautiful, with black hair and a shawl. He looked very handsome.</p>
<p>His skin is white and even makes the female students feel inferior to him when they see it. In particular, although his eyes are Phoenix eyes, there is a touch of essence in his eyes, which makes the whole person&rsquo;s temperament very special.</p>
<p>He held some small fish in his hand, and sometimes threw them into the pool, which were torn and devoured by those golden fish.</p>
<p>At the moment, along the path, the middle-aged man, who was slapped by Bai Xiaochun, came as fast as iron. When he arrived here, he could not help slowing down, showing respect in his face and clasping his fist in front of the youth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have seen the young master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little Lord, Bai Xiaochun is not proud. I have made my words very clear. I asked him to come and see him, but he was arrogant and arrogant with his identity.&rdquo; Said the middle-aged man, gritting his teeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all. It&rsquo;s just a little guy. I asked him to come and see him. It&rsquo;s just on the spur of the moment.&rdquo; The youth did not look up, did not care, light mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the little Lord said is that it&rsquo;s just a small person. The honor of a disciple is for the dead. As for the leader&rsquo;s younger brother, his identity is really ridiculous. He worships a dead man as his teacher.&rdquo; The middle-aged man nodded and sneered. He found that the young man raised his head and looked at himself coldly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Less Little master&hellip; &quot; The middle-aged man was afraid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is a small man. Don&rsquo;t worry about it. But the headmaster, the master and the ancestor of the clan, can&rsquo;t you call him directly? Go to the cold pool and punish him for three months.&rdquo; The young man looked back and continued to feed the golden fish.</p>
<p>The middle-aged man&rsquo;s heart was shaking, so he nodded and left.</p>
<p>After settling the matter of Qian Dajin, Bai Xiaochun returns to Xiangyun mountain. Bai Xiaochun doesn&rsquo;t care about Shangguan Tianyou. He has merits. Unless he betrays his family, his life will not be threatened.</p>
<p>However, seeing that he was a martial uncle, he couldn&rsquo;t find the feeling of being called. Everyone was hiding from him. Bai Xiaochun felt some emotion. Until he passed the lecture hall by chance, he was suddenly excited.</p>
<p>He found that as soon as he arrived, he was immediately given a seat, sitting with the elder who told the Scriptures, overlooking the countless disciples below.</p>
<p>After experiencing this kind of thing, Bai Xiaochun immediately liked it, so her figure always appeared in the lecture hall of every mountain peak.</p>
<p>Even when he sat there, he nodded with a smile from time to time, and sometimes looked at the disciples below. His eyes were as appreciative and gratifying as those of the building foundation elders around him.</p>
<p>In this scene, not only the elders of Zhuji around him could not laugh or cry, but the disciples of the mountains below were all depressed to the extreme. When they looked at Bai Xiaochun, they hated each other, but they could not help it.</p>
<p>At the same time, Bai Xiaochun also found a new way to show off his leader&rsquo;s elder martial brother. He began to appear frequently around the various foundation building friars of the clan, enjoying the same treatment every time.</p>
<p>When he saw those foundation building friars, he immediately stepped forward and took a bite of a senior brother and sister. They were very clever. The monks could not say anything, but they looked strange after many times. However, the disciples around him could not help but address uncle Bai.</p>
<p>After this kind of state lasted for a period of time, Bai Xiaochun saw Li Qinghou for a time, but she couldn&rsquo;t help it and called out kindly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, senior brother Li.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li Qinghou looks a little haggard. Up to now, he has finally practiced jiujue Dan. He is about to go out. He is stunned and looks around. After seeing Bai Xiaochun, his face twitches. Although he is refining alchemy, he also hears and suffers from headache. Now he finds that Bai Xiaochun actually calls himself that way. Li Qinghou stares.</p>
<p>When Bai Xiaochun finished, he regretted it. When he saw Li Qinghou staring at him, he immediately took a breath. What he was most afraid of in the door was Li Qinghou.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle Li I I was wrong. &quot; Bai Xiaochun cried and began to speak in a hurry.</p>
<p>Li Qinghou looked at Bai Xiaochun. He was helpless. He glared at Bai Xiaochun again. He reprimanded Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s recent affairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to go out for a few months in a short time and a year in a slow time. Don&rsquo;t play too much in these days. It&rsquo;s the right way to practice hard.&rdquo; Li Qinghou told him a few more words, and then he turned to leave.</p>
<p>Bai xiaochunchang breathed a sigh of relief and looked at Li Qinghou&rsquo;s back. Although there was fear in his eyes, it was more of a kind of gentleness towards his elders. He heard Du Lingfei say that after he disappeared, Li Qinghou searched for himself alone for two months. When he came back with some pieces of his clothes, he often blamed himself.</p>
<p>This kind of warmth is Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s whole life. Since his parents died of illness, he seldom realized that he had already unconsciously regarded Li Qinghou as his family member.</p>
<p>With Li Qinghou&rsquo;s reprimand, Bai Xiaochun stopped coughing for half a month. Instead of always coughing at people, she just went outside Zhou Xinqi&rsquo;s cave and thought about the whole clan. Among the people she knew well, Zhou Xinqi didn&rsquo;t call her uncle Bai.</p>
<p>A few days later, he saw Zhou Xinqi again. He was still walking on blue silk. Bai Xiaochun couldn&rsquo;t fly. He watched her fly away. He was depressed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are only a few magic weapons in the clan that can make the disciples fly. Unless Chen Heng has some special skills, it can only rely on magic weapons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s unfair. Shouldn&rsquo;t all these magic weapons be given by the master? I My master&hellip; &quot; Bai Xiaochun sighed and sighed again and again. After a few steps, he suddenly stopped, turned around and went straight to zhongdaoshan.</p>
<p>As his leader&rsquo;s younger brother, he entered Zhongdao mountain without any hindrance. He soon reached the top of the mountain and arrived in front of the hall where the leader Zheng Yuandong was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master, elder martial brother, master, elder martial brother!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to incense the master!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun swaggered in and yelled. In the hall, Zheng Yuandong opened his eyes from his knees and sighed.</p>
<p>In these days, too many people came here to tell him what Bai Xiaochun had done. He had already regretted it. However, he had no choice but to pretend that he didn&rsquo;t see it. After all, although Bai Xiaochun had this kind of evil interest, he didn&rsquo;t have any intention of harming others. That&rsquo;s enough.</p>
<p>At the moment, hearing Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s cry, Zheng Yuandong walked out slowly, coughing, and looked solemn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, I hear you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Younger martial brother, I&rsquo;ve met the leader.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun looks cute, and after seeing Zheng Yuandong, he quickly worships him.</p>
<p>Looking at Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s appearance, Zheng Yuandong sighs from the bottom of his heart. Now he really knows Bai Xiaochun. When he shakes his head and smiles bitterly, he takes Bai Xiaochun to the back mountain forbidden area.</p>
<p>In a cave in the back mountain, there is a portrait on the wall, in which there is a middle-aged man with a smile and staring into the distance. The whole picture is full of a very special atmosphere, which makes the person in the painting seem to be alive without death.</p>
<p>Under the portrait is Gongtai, on which are placed spiritual fruits and candles. Although the whole cave is simple and elegant, it gives people a sense of solemnity.</p>
<p>As soon as Bai Xiaochun entered the cave, she immediately came to the portrait and knelt there with a puff of sound. She kowtowed respectfully and repeatedly for nine times.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, master.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun looks at the master in the portrait. His eyes show piety.</p>
<p>Zheng Yuandong nodded to himself. He thought that although Bai Xiaochun was naughty, he still had the loyalty and filial piety. From his experience, he naturally saw that Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s expression was really devout, without any deliberate affectation.</p>
<p>But then Bai Xiaochun spoke again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master, I am so hard that I can&rsquo;t fly Other disciples, their masters give magic weapons and things to protect their lives. Only I don&rsquo;t have them here&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master, I don&rsquo;t care about the foreign objects. As long as I can give you incense, I&rsquo;ll be satisfied. Maybe Shifu, your spirit in heaven, can also become a magic weapon to give me a dream&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Listening to Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s words, Zheng Yuandong on one side suddenly opened his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master, I was chased and killed all the way for the sake of protecting the clan, inheriting for thousands of years, and upholding the great righteousness of the clan. All the magic weapons were destroyed and abandoned at that time. Now I have nothing left after returning to the sect. My pocket is shriveled and everything is gone. I&rsquo;m not even as good as a servant&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master, don&rsquo;t be under pressure. It&rsquo;s OK. Even if you don&rsquo;t have a magic weapon to protect your body and even if you don&rsquo;t have a magic weapon that can fly, you are also duty bound to go through fire and water for the clan! Just in case I haven&rsquo;t come to give you incense for some time, it means that I lost my life because I didn&rsquo;t have a magic weapon to protect my life, because I didn&rsquo;t have a flying magic weapon I&rsquo;ll go to see you in person and get together with you Bai Xiaochun said, while looking at the headmaster behind him.</p>
<p>Zheng Yuandong&rsquo;s face twitched. This time he was really shocked by Bai Xiaochun. After so many years of practice, it was the first time that he met such a wonderful disciple as Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>At the moment, he smiles bitterly in his heart. When he looks up at the master in the portrait, he thinks of many past events, especially when he was just worshipped by the master, and the master also gave him some body protecting magic weapons.</p>
<p>Thinking of this, Zheng Yuandong sighs and looks at Bai Xiaochun. His eyes are soft.</p>
<p>After a while, Bai Xiaochun followed Zheng Yuandong out of the cave. All the way, he looked at Zheng Yuandong eagerly until he reached the main hall of zhongdaoshan. Zheng Yuandong stopped, turned his head and looked at Bai Xiaochun. With a wave of his right hand, he suddenly saw two lights of gold and white in his hands.</p>
<p>The golden one is a flying sword, the size of a palm. But at the same time, there are some distortions in the nothingness around. The high temperature spreads out. It looks extraordinary. On the sword, there are some complicated runes that are shining slowly. Every time it flashes, it will cause slight fluctuations around.</p>
<p>As for the white light, it is a small shield. The shield is the size of a palm, and the whole body is like a white jade. A crane is carved on it. It is vivid and warm. From time to time, it spreads out from the small white jade shield.</p>
<p>When Bai Xiaochun saw these two objects, he immediately felt extraordinary. His eyes flashed and his breath was short. But soon he saw that there were three silver lines on both swords and shields.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jinwu sword, this sword seals a golden crow. It has the power of burning. The golden crow can be transformed into illusions, which is comparable to the user&rsquo;s accomplishments. It is good at flying. It can reach the initial stage of foundation construction. If it bursts, it will be more powerful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God crane shield, take a crane soul, condense this protective magic weapon, which can prevent you from a life and death crisis under the foundation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I used to take these two items to the master for three times, but I didn&rsquo;t dare to continue to refine. This was given to me by my master when I was a beginner. Today, I give it to you on behalf of my master.&rdquo; Zheng Yuandong looks at Bai Xiaochun with a more gentle look and encouragement in his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, master, thank you, master!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun was excited and quickly took it over and couldn&rsquo;t put it down.</p>
