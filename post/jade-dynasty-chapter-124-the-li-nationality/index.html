      <p>Qilidong, the border area of Southern Xinjiang.</p>
<p>Miao altar.</p>
<p>Deep in the dark and silent hall, the still sober ghost and the great wizard did not speak. Only the burning fire made a crackling sound from time to time. In addition, in the quiet altar, there is a strange sound.</p>
<p>Monkey Xiaohui was drunk, and now he was sleeping soundly and snoring.</p>
<p>In the past, GUI Li was often with Xiao Hui, but he didn&rsquo;t realize that Xiao Hui would snore when he was sleeping. It seems that Miao liquor is really extraordinary. I saw the face of the monkey red, a drum on the belly of a drum, constantly ups and downs, lovely and a bit funny.</p>
<p>However, when he was drunk, Xiaobai&rsquo;s appearance was much better than Xiaohui&rsquo;s. The Nine Tailed Tianhu, who has practiced for thousands of years, naturally excelled Xiaohui in his moral conduct. After this great drunkenness, his skin became pink, and his head leaned back, and his eyebrows were full of amorous feelings. He was really a monster that reversed all living beings.</p>
<p>GUI Li sighed in his heart and turned his head.</p>
<p>The great wizard still faced the fire and did not turn back, but now he slowly said, &ldquo;you friend, it seems that you are not an ordinary person!&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li was surprised and thought that the great wizard was mysterious. Did he see through Xiaobai&rsquo;s identity as Jiuwei Tianhu? Although the customs of the five ethnic groups in southern Xinjiang are quite different from those in the Middle Kingdom, they are much closer to the living animals than the people in the Middle Kingdom. However, they are not sure how to treat these demons.</p>
<p>Then he pondered for a moment, pondered over the words, and said slowly, &ldquo;why, how can the great wizard treat a woman like her differently?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The great wizard was silent for a moment, and said faintly: &ldquo;like her, a weak woman has put down dozens of strong men of Miao nationality by her drinking capacity. Is it still an ordinary person?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was stunned, and then he put down his heart. He just shook his head when he thought of the spectacular scene that Xiaobai was just drinking with a group of Miao people at the foot of the mountain.</p>
<p>Perhaps, she also needs to indulge and vent after 300 years of loneliness and pain in the dark fire altar!</p>
<p>He turned his head gently. Xiaobai is still quietly leaning against his leg and sleeping quietly. Gentle breathing, light closed lips and light closed eyes, long and delicate eyelashes occasionally gently vibrate. It seems like a child who falls asleep but has something on his mind. Maybe he dreams of something?</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t know, now she still sleeps soundly, can have nightmare.</p>
<p>Make her suffer in a dream?</p>
<p>Xiaobai&rsquo;s delicate eyebrows wrinkled slightly, as if feeling the gaze of his eyes, but as if he had dreamt of something. He turned his head slightly and then fell asleep again.</p>
<p>In the light of fire, her face is less charming, but it seems that she has never seen the innocence.</p>
<p>He looked away from the wizard and said, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s drunk too much. I&rsquo;m afraid I can&rsquo;t answer your question now, great wizard</p>
<p>The great wizard was not surprised, and did not look back at the woman. After a pause, he slowly said, &ldquo;there is one thing you may not know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost Li one Zheng, way: &ldquo;what, please say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In front of the big, bent figure, gently pulling out the shadow. Even his voice sounded a bit erratic: &ldquo;this resurrection magic has always been passed down only among the Miao altar witches. Please make it clear. Only great Witches of all ages have such miracles. They have never been spread out, and even our own people do not know about them. But I can&rsquo;t think of how this girl can know about it when she looks young. &quot;</p>
<p>He is a fox who has been practicing for thousands of years. Only because of her profound morality, she incarnated in human form, and her appearance was charming and beautiful. In terms of experience, few people in the world could match her.</p>
<p>However, this is not a good thing to say to the great wizard. He changed his mind and said, &ldquo;wizard, you haven&rsquo;t turned your head or looked at her. How can you know that she is a young woman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wizard&rsquo;s head tilted slightly to the side, as if with a low smile. He didn&rsquo;t know if he could see through the ghost&rsquo;s mind. He said, &ldquo;since this girl is drunk, let&rsquo;s wait for her to wake up! You are a guest from afar. When you go out, find our Miao clan leader, Tu Magu. I will ask someone to give him a message and ask him to arrange for you to stay here for a few days. &quot;</p>
<p>GUI Li frowned. In his wish, he wanted to make an agreement with the great wizard immediately and go to save Biyao. However, although his voice was flat, there was no doubt about it. It was obvious that we should first find out the origin of Xiaobai. At the moment, I have asked for help. If I think about it for ten years, what&rsquo;s the matter if I wait another day?</p>
<p>He took a deep breath, nodded his head and said, &ldquo;good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The great wizard said quietly, &ldquo;then you go out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li nodded to the wizard&rsquo;s back. He was about to get up and walk out, but he was stunned for a moment.</p>
<p>Xiaobai is sleeping soundly on his thigh. How can he tell her to walk?</p>
<p>GUI Li reluctantly called twice, and Xiaobai turned a deaf ear as expected, and vaguely seemed to be annoyed by being disturbed at the moment. He pursed his mouth, turned over and fell asleep again.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter if she turns over. Xiaohui was leaning against her stomach, but now she bumps her head to the ground. However, the monkey has no idea and snores so much. It seems that the monkey&rsquo;s head is also very hard, which is more powerful than the ordinary monkey&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>Ghost Li sighed and shook his head. After hesitating for a moment, he had to bend down and hold Xiaobai. Then he stood up, stretched out his hands and held Xiaobai up. He took Xiaohui to his shoulder, picked up the monkey and walked out.</p>
<p>Lying in his arms in the small white, faint fragrance, shallow smile, and that white with pink face, in front of him gently shaking.</p>
<p>He took a deep breath and strode out of the altar.</p>
<p>Walking out of the dark altar, stepping over the two huge stone pillars at the door, the sun suddenly sprinkled on his face.</p>
<p>There is a gentle warmth from the body. GUI Li narrowed his eyes slightly and saw the picture of qilidong standing in front of him not far away from the mountain.</p>
<p>A wizard like Miao people came out of the altar behind GUI Li, passed by Gui Li, went to Tu Ma Gu, and whispered a few words to him. Tu Ma Gu turns his head and looks at GUI Li. Then his eyes fall on Xiaobai, who is drunk and sleepy. He nods, as if he has promised something.</p>
<p>The wizard turned around without expression, and without looking at the ghost, went straight back to the altar. Disappeared in the shadow.</p>
<p>Tu Ma Gu came over with a smile and said, &ldquo;how, did the great wizard agree?&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a smile, he said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. He asked us to stay here. &quot;</p>
<p>Tu Ma Gu nodded his head and said, &ldquo;I know. You can follow me.&rdquo; Then he turned and walked down the mountain.</p>
<p>GUI Li followed him with Xiaobai Xiaohui in his arms. He only listened to Tu Ma Gu and said, &ldquo;we are a remote country, but we can&rsquo;t compare with the prosperity of your middle land. You can do whatever you like! Hehe</p>
<p>The head of the Miao nationality is very easygoing. Nod head way: &ldquo;patriarch, you are polite, we disturb you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tu Ma Gu ha ha ha smile, also did not say what.</p>
<p>Down the mountain, Tu Ma Gu pondered for a moment, then took the ghost to the river.</p>
<p>Along the way, many Miao people have paid attention to it, but their eyes are obviously lingering on Xiaobai.</p>
<p>They passed the stone bridge with the Chinese flavor that they had seen before, and came to a relatively secluded house on the opposite bank built on the edge of a row of green trees.</p>
<p>GUI Li stood behind Tu Ma Gu and frowned quickly and slightly. The house is not big. It has only one floor and one room. It is simple and unsophisticated. It is entirely made of wood. On the wall outside the house, there are no animal fur and bones hanging from ordinary Miao people&rsquo;s houses.</p>
<p>Tu Ma Gu turned his head and said, &ldquo;this house has been vacant for a long time, but we have been cleaning it all the time. It is quite clean, and there are few people here. You&rsquo;d better stay here for one night</p>
<p>GUI Li slightly nodded his head and said, &ldquo;thank you very much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tu Ma Gu laughed and looked at Xiao Bai in his arms and said, &ldquo;then I won&rsquo;t disturb you. Take a rest first</p>
<p>After that, he just wanted to leave, but he stopped, as if thinking of something, and said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send someone to bring some food to you later. You can rest assured! We have simple customs here. I have wronged you. &quot;</p>
<p>Ghost Li repeatedly shakes his head, way: &ldquo;where, thank patriarch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tu Ma Gu nodded and turned away. Ghost Li Mu sent him a paragraph, when he went far away, turned around and looked at the room again.</p>
<p>How to look at it, the house is like a house built by Chinese people</p>
<p>He took Xiaobai Xiaohui, pushed the door open and went in.</p>
<p>The arrangement in the room is very simple. There is a bed, a table, a few wooden chairs, and the walls are made of Paulownia with neat size. The window is open on one side, and there is a faint fragrance of trees in the whole room.</p>
<p>GUI Li has never been an important person to see the luxury of accommodation. It is so simple, but it is in his mind. At the moment, he put Xiaobai on the bed. He murmured twice and fell asleep again.</p>
<p>Ghost Li shook his head and took the ash down from his shoulder. He saw the monkey&rsquo;s mouth open and close. From time to time, he made a tut sound. Seeing his satisfied appearance, he sighed and put it on the bed.</p>
<p>Looking at the man sleeping peacefully, he turned around, walked to the table and sat down. There seemed to be a sudden silence in the room, and there was no sound except for their breath.</p>
<p>He sat alone in this strange house.</p>
<p>Outside the window, the sun is shining.</p>
<p>Surrounded by mountains, qilidong is ten miles east of a rolling mountain. On the top of one of the mountains stood two men, who were looking up at the fertile land among the mountains in the distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s qilidong!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man standing in front of him said this in a low voice. There was deep emotion, anger and desire in his words.</p>
<p>In the sun, this is a very strong and tall man, naked upper body, lower body is made of beast skin pants.</p>
<p>His skin has a strong bronze color due to the perennial sun and wind. There was a bear&rsquo;s head tattoo on his chest. In addition, there are huge and crisscross scars all over his body. It is not difficult to imagine that he once fought with many terrible beasts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, patriarch.&rdquo; The answer to him was a man standing one step behind him, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s qilidong.&rdquo; His clothes were similar to the man in front of him, but in addition to the fur trousers, he also wore fur clothes on his upper body, which was much smaller than that of the strong man in front of him.</p>
<p>At the moment, he seemed to have a faint smile at the corner of his mouth. He looked at the front and slowly said, &ldquo;there is the fundamental place of Miao people who have been in charge of Southern Xinjiang for 200 years. At the same time, the &ldquo;bone jade&rdquo; is located in the Miao altars in qilidong, under the statue of the evil god and dog of the Miao people. It&rsquo;s been suppressed for two hundred years! &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cluck&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The harsh voice suddenly sounded from the strong man in front of him, but the man behind him looked at him as the leader of the Li clan. Clenched his fist, the knuckles burst out with great strength.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two hundred years! Two hundred years The strong man spoke to himself as if he were growling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! Two hundred years. Two hundred years ago, we were secretly attacked by the despicable Miao people. Their evil great wizard cursed our soldiers to death with evil magic. They robbed us of our sacred &ldquo;bone jade&rdquo; and drove us to the most barren place in southern Xinjiang and lived the most miserable life for 200 years. &quot; The man behind him, with cold words, lightly said the grudge.</p>
<p>The strong mountain wind blows on the Li clan chief&rsquo;s mountain like body, like a sword, but he has no response. At the moment, in his eyes, only the hot land surrounded by mountains ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To lose the bone jade is the greatest insult and disrespect to the bear God!&rdquo; The man behind him is still talking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So over the past two hundred years, the bear God became angry and refused to take care of our Li people. Until today, as long as we defeat the Miao people and take back the bone jade, the God of bear will surely visit our Li nationality again, so that we can occupy the best land in southern Xinjiang and let our people and descendants live here for generations. &quot;</p>
<p>His voice suddenly became high and said, &ldquo;patriarch, we must not let our future children still be like us. To fight with such monsters as the fire wolf and the black tiger, which the strongest soldiers can&rsquo;t resist, just to grab some food. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want to live, we want the best land!&rdquo; He said bitterly.</p>
<p>Ahead, the giant patriarch did not turn back. But his angry, heavy gasps have revealed his feelings. After a moment of silence, he turned his head and said, &ldquo;is there really no problem with the other three races?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man behind immediately nodded his head and said, &ldquo;yes, clan leader, the Miao people have always been domineering here in southern Xinjiang. The other three ethnic groups have long despised them. The Zhuang people are numerous, but they have to be subordinated to the Miao people. They have long been reluctant to accept it. The Tu nationality has always kept a distance from the other four ethnic groups and refused to intervene in other ethnic disputes. The last Gaoshan people are weak and weak, so they can only protect themselves and cannot expand. &quot;</p>
<p>With a vague look on his face, he said in a low voice: &ldquo;patriarch, as long as we defeat the Miao in one fell swoop, with the bravery of our Li soldiers fighting the most ferocious beast in southern Xinjiang in the past 200 years, and with the blessing of the great bear God, the day when we will dominate Southern Xinjiang is within sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the eyes of the Li clan leader, there was a burning look. Even looking at the qilidong in front of him, it seemed that his whole body trembled slightly. It was excitement and desire, and perhaps the bloodthirsty instinct of soldiers.</p>
<p>But after all, he was the head of the clan, not a thoughtless man. After his initial excitement, he was silent, then turned to stare at the man behind him and said, &ldquo;ahetai, it is said that the evil Miao wizard has lived for 300 years and is still in the deepest part of the Miao people&rsquo;s altar. His evil method is the most terrifying force in southern Xinjiang. Can you really deal with him? &quot;</p>
<p>A mysterious smile appeared on the face of the man he called ahetai, and said, &ldquo;patriarch, I have shown you the divine Dharma taught to me by the animal God in 100000 mountains. In addition to the magic treasure he gave me, the great wizard is dead. Otherwise, even if he is alive, I will surely defeat him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The leader of the Li clan looked at him for a long time and nodded his head.</p>
<p>In fact, the shadow of the great wizard has always been a dark cloud over the heads of all ethnic groups in southern Xinjiang, and it is also a lingering nightmare for the Li nationality. But after the mysterious return from 100000 mountains, the man named ahetai, who had disappeared since childhood, suddenly showed his incredible magic power. The power was so powerful that the whole Li people once again stirred the hatred that had been buried in their hearts.</p>
<p>To live, to live better!</p>
<p>The leader of the Li nationality clenched his teeth fiercely. On his tall and strong body, the huge tattoo on the bear&rsquo;s head seemed even more ferocious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two hundred years of revenge, we will avenge it tonight!&rdquo; The words came out of his teeth.</p>
<p>The sun shone on him and ahotei&rsquo;s bodies, warm on the mountains. Behind the two men, on the hillside on the sunny side, there were countless Li soldiers with solemn and stern expressions. Everyone was so strong. On their wounded chests, the ferocious tattoos on the bear&rsquo;s head seemed to roar in the wind!</p>
<p>Qilidong, secluded cottage.</p>
<p>GUI Li sat at the table in the room, quietly and speechless. Time here, as if suddenly slowed down the pace of general, silent and torture.</p>
<p>What do you think of in such a quiet time?</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s the past</p>
<p>Youth time, like a sigh echoing in the quiet years, gently up, and quietly fall, finally no trace.</p>
<p>His expression was indifferent, and his eyebrows wrinkled slightly.</p>
<p>The scenery outside the window is picturesque.</p>
<p>Quiet, quiet</p>
<p>Until, all of a sudden, a voice woke him up from his meditation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dong, Dong, Dong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A thin knock on the door suddenly rang in the house.</p>
<p>He looked back at the door. (to be continued. )</p>
