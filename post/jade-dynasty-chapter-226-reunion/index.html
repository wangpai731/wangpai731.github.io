      <p>Field not easy to grow a breath, the face showed a smile.</p>
<p>But Lu Xueqi, after all, is a man with a close mind. She pondered for a moment, looked at Tian Bu Yi and said, &ldquo;Uncle Tian, what you just meant was that he Can you go back to Qingyun? &quot;</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi snorted and said, &ldquo;ten years ago, the truth was revealed on Qingyun Mountain. Lao Qi ran away. After several times of thinking, I only felt that there was nothing wrong with Lao Qi. He did nothing wrong at all. As a result, Qingyun was wrongly reflected. In my life, I have only accepted seven apprentices. Although one of them is not a success, it is impossible for me to confiscate this disciple and let it go. &quot;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi, like a man in the dark for a long time, suddenly saw a faint light in front of her. At the moment, she was really surprised and pleased.</p>
<p>Tian Buyi said, &ldquo;I also know that if I do this, I&rsquo;m afraid there will be many twists and turns. But in the past ten years, I&rsquo;ve been paying attention to Lao Qi. At last, he&rsquo;s still in good health, and I haven&rsquo;t heard that he has done anything harmful to nature. &quot;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi said, &ldquo;yes, I have paid attention to it, but I have never heard of his bad deeds after he joined the demon sect &quot;</p>
<p>Later, she found that Tian Bu Yi looked at her with a smile on her face, and her voice gradually became smaller.</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi nodded and said, &ldquo;you are a man of purpose. I think it&rsquo;s hard for you to come here in the past ten years. &quot;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi was silent.</p>
<p>Tian Buyi coughed a few times and seemed to be out of breath. Then he said, &ldquo;in a word, as long as he still recognizes me as a master, it&rsquo;s not his business.&rdquo; he took a look at Lu Xueqi and said with a smile, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t ignore your affairs. &quot;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi bit her lips with her teeth. After a while. He lowered his head slightly and said in a low voice, &ldquo;thank you, martial uncle. &quot;</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi nodded, but he coughed for a while. It seemed that the conversation just now was full of interest. While he was happy, he looked a little tired, and the black air on his face seemed to be heavier.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi couldn&rsquo;t help but feel a little worried and said, &ldquo;Uncle Tian.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d better not talk more now, and take care of yourself first! &quot;</p>
<p>Then she looked up at the sky and said, &ldquo;I can see that it will be dawn in two hours at most. Then I will go back to Qingyun Mountain and tell my master and uncle Su Ru. &quot;</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi nodded and closed his eyes again.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi deeply breathed in, calmed down her restless mood and closed her eyes. But at the same time, her mouth, but still quietly revealed that a faint smile.</p>
<p>That only belongs to her, small happy smile!</p>
<p>In the distant sky, there is a faint star light in the thick clouds, such as the girl&rsquo;s simple eyes. Later, the wind blows, a dark cloud floats over and covers it again.</p>
<p>Below the clouds. There are two faint lights and shadows across the sky, coming in this direction.</p>
<p>With Xiao Huan and wild dog Taoist priest, Monday fairy left the abandoned villa, which was unfortunate for them, and walked all the way to the main road.</p>
<p>Zhou Yixian is old, and his pace is much faster than that of the young man. Xiao Huan and the wild dog Taoist even have some difficulty to follow.</p>
<p>After walking for a long time, the road ahead gradually became clear. The little ring, who was panting, said angrily, &ldquo;grandfather, are you tired? How can you walk so fast? &quot;</p>
<p>Monday immortal looked at the road not far ahead, and then looked back at the direction of the villa where no shadow could be seen. Then he was relieved, stopped and said, &ldquo;what do you know? We are really lucky this time. If we still don&rsquo;t know good or bad and stay away from the village, are we looking for luck? &quot;</p>
<p>After a moment&rsquo;s pause, Xiao Huan recalled his experience in the villa, especially when he thought of the mysterious demon man. He shook his head and said, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe that there are such powerful evil demons at the foot of Qingyun Mountain. &quot;</p>
<p>Monday fairy suddenly sneered and said, &ldquo;if it wasn&rsquo;t at the foot of Qingyun Mountain, you wouldn&rsquo;t have seen it! &quot;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan and the wild dog Taoist standing on the side were both stunned and said, &ldquo;what? &quot;</p>
<p>Zhou Yixian frowned, but he seemed to think of something. Knowing that he was speechless, he looked to the left and right, waved his hand and said, &ldquo;well, let&rsquo;s get out of here quickly, and get into the city as soon as possible. When we get to the boundary where there are many people, we will not be afraid.</p>
<p>&quot;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan looks at zhouyixian strangely, but she ignores her. She goes first. Xiaohuan takes a few steps and comes to Zhou Yixian. She is about to ask. Unexpectedly, she coughs, but looks up at the sky and says, &ldquo;Xiaohuan, do you think the night is good tonight &quot;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan spat at him and said, &ldquo;how dare you say that the night is good in the dark and windy night? &quot;</p>
<p>Monday fairy laughed two times, and took a few steps forward. Xiaohuan looked at his grandfather&rsquo;s back suspiciously. He only felt that there was something wrong with his words.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, a gust of wind swept behind her, but a dark shadow quickly caught up with them in the direction behind them.</p>
<p>Monday fairy, Xiao Huan and wild dog Taoist were all startled. For a while, they all had the same idea in their hearts: is it just this short time that the devil has caught up?</p>
<p>Looking back, the three men were stunned. Although the visitor was also black, he was not the mysterious and strange demon, but the mysterious man in black whom he had seen not long ago.</p>
<p>Naturally, the Lich saw the three men, but he didn&rsquo;t care about it. He didn&rsquo;t slow down when he passed them. Obviously, he wanted to leave here early.</p>
<p>Just as the Lich could pass by, a woman&rsquo;s voice came from behind her, shouting, &ldquo;wait a minute. &quot;</p>
<p>The Lich was stunned. Her body turned around in the air. She stopped and looked back. However, two of the three men were surprised and looked at the girl standing in the middle. However, the girl seemed to stay for a while and did not speak for a moment.</p>
<p>The Lich looked up and down at the little ring and said, &ldquo;girl, did you call me? &quot;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan hesitated for a moment and said, &ldquo;yes. &quot;</p>
<p>The Lich said, &ldquo;what can I do for you? &quot;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan choked for a moment. Just now, she suddenly called out to the man in black. For nothing else, she just felt that the clothes on her body were very similar to her mysterious master who had only seen two faces. But for their breath and difference, the Lich did not have the unique ghost spirit. I was about to blurt out and call master.</p>
<p>However, when the Lich asked this question, Xiaohuan didn&rsquo;t know where to start. After a long pause, she asked in embarrassment, &ldquo;this Excuse me, sir. Do you know another as like as two peas in you? &quot;</p>
<p>The Lich froze for a moment, shook his head and said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>&quot;</p>
<p>Small ring frown, still want to talk, next to Monday fairy is heavily pulled her. Pulling her behind her, she smiles at the Lich in black and says, &ldquo;this gentleman, the little girl is not sensible. Don&rsquo;t care. &quot;</p>
<p>With that, he glared at Xiao Huan fiercely, pulled the little ring and left. Seeing that they were gone, the wild dog Taoist priest hurriedly followed him. Xiaohuan looked embarrassed. But the mouth still Wu self-improvement way: &ldquo;grandfather, what are you doing?&rdquo;? &quot;</p>
<p>Monday fairy snorted and said, &ldquo;are you looking for trouble? &quot;</p>
<p>Xiao Huan&rsquo;s voice went down. He looked back at the Lich. He saw the man in black standing in his place. He could not help but murmured to the immortal Monday, &ldquo;but they are really like &quot;</p>
<p>Monday fairy is lazy to pay attention to her, will her grasp more tightly, stride to the road in the distance. Seeing that the old and the young walked far away, it seemed that there were still some murmurs of the little ring in the wind. The Lich felt quite puzzled for a moment. For a long time, he seemed to smile bitterly, shook his head, and turned to go.</p>
<p>It was only his body that moved. Suddenly, he quickly turned back, facing the direction of the abandoned villa when he came. His eyes flashed and he kept staring.</p>
<p>Along the direction of his sight, two shadows can be seen in the distant sky. Towards the villa.</p>
<p>The Lich hesitated for a moment. At last, he dispelled his curiosity, shook his head, and drifted away.</p>
<p>In his intuition, the villa is not a good place to go, or not to go!</p>
<p>At the moment, the abandoned villa is still shrouded in silence. Lu Xueqi slowly opens her eyes and looks around her with clear and bright eyes. She sees that everything around is quiet and there is no difference. Then she puts her heart down.</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi is still the same as before. He sits on the stone steps with his eyes closed. The night wind blows quietly from time to time. However, he still can&rsquo;t move his clothes. It seems that all the wind has bypassed his body.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi suddenly moved in her heart. She seemed to think of something strange. Her eyebrows wrinkled slightly, but her eyes fell on Tian Bu Yi&rsquo;s body. After a while, the color of doubt in her eyes became more and more serious.</p>
<p>When she had just rescued Tian Buyi from the prison coffin, Lu Xueqi realized that the long-time unknown martial uncle Da zhufengtian was much fatter than she had remembered. However, her face did not change, but it seemed that only the short and fat body was two circles wider than before. At the moment, the clothes on him seemed to be a little tight.</p>
<p>But, I don&rsquo;t know why, although Tian is not easy to get fat, Lu Xueqi always thinks that Tian is not easy to be fat, but she can&rsquo;t see what&rsquo;s wrong for a while. She can&rsquo;t help worrying. Although she broke the coffin prohibition with the magic power of Daofa, which implied the magic method of the heavenly script, she was surprised by the strange power of the forbidden field after a few simple exchanges. Among them, she had never seen the power of Demon power.</p>
<p>Thinking of this, Lu Xueqi felt that she should ask Tian Buyi clearly. After making up her mind, she turned around and wanted to speak. Unexpectedly, at this time, Tian Buyi, who had been keeping her eyes closed, suddenly opened her eyes. Her eyes were shining, but she didn&rsquo;t look at Lu Xueqi. Instead, her face was slightly distorted, staring at the dark ink like night sky.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi heart a Lin, stood up, looked up, a moment later, her body also for one shock.</p>
<p>Above the dark sky, a dark shadow flew down like a swift wind and lightning, and was wrapped in a mass of black gas. Before he arrived, the surging Demon power seemed to have surged in.</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi slowly stood up.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi felt some hair dryness in her mouth and whispered, &ldquo;is that him? &quot;</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi nodded slowly and said in a deep voice, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s him. &quot;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s eyes have never left the shadow. She just sighed and did not speak again. Only in the hands of the Tianya, Xiaguang circulation, quietly stretched up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoa! &quot;</p>
<p>A whistling in the wind, the dark shadow fell from the sky and fell into the villa. Then he saw Tian Buyi and Lu Xueqi standing at the gate of the abandoned house. It seems that he was stunned for a moment, but there was no sense of fear. After a moment, he made a strange laugh of &ldquo;tut tut&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi fixed her eyes. The whole body of the man was covered with a thick layer of black air, and she could not see his figure and face clearly. However, she could not recognize the laughter he had just uttered. This voice was the kind and dignified master in her impression.</p>
<p>The mysterious man looked at Tian Buyi and Lu Xueqi, and finally took a look at Tianya in Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s hands. Suddenly she said, &ldquo;did she save you? &quot;</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi snorted and didn&rsquo;t answer. He just looked at the black air around the mysterious man. His eyes were full of anger. He could not help but take a step.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi was expressionless, but she also took two steps in the other direction. For a moment, she and Tian were not easy to become interested in the mysterious figure.</p>
<p>Tian is not easy to be a Taoist. That&rsquo;s needless to say. It&rsquo;s Lu Xueqi, with her Taoism at the moment. It&rsquo;s enough to boast in the whole world, but the mysterious figure seems to be so arrogant that he never puts them in his eyes. Instead, he laughs. The laughter is hoarse and deep, and it rings in the deserted villa in the dead of night, just like crying and howling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The field is not easy. Do you dare to fight with me? &quot;</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi said, &ldquo;you are deeply possessed. I have only one battle.&rdquo;. &quot;</p>
<p>The man sneered and said, &ldquo;you say I am possessed. How do you know it&rsquo;s not you who can&rsquo;t see through it? &quot;</p>
<p>Tian is not easy to lift his right hand. At that time, his magic weapon red flame is already in his hand, burning in his hands like a flame. He just heard him say one word: &ldquo;you are full of mysterious Yin and ghost, and you do not know how many innocent lives and lonely ghosts have been killed. What else can you say? &quot;</p>
<p>After the word &ldquo;Xuanyin Guiqi&rdquo; reached Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s ears, she couldn&rsquo;t help changing her color slightly, and her face flashed with surprise. As far as she knows, this strange and evil method called Xuanyin ghost Qi. It is not the magic power of the demon sect, but the ghost and strange skill that has been lost for many years. It is all made up of the spirit of the living and the ghost spirit by the sorcery. We can imagine its sinister place.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that these strange demons have ever appeared in front of this person. It&rsquo;s really incredible!</p>
<p>There was a burst of black air all over the mysterious man, from which came several cold smiles. It seemed that he was about to say something, but he stopped again, turned slightly and looked back at the sky.</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi and Lu Xueqi are also aware of the past, and their faces are slightly changed.</p>
<p>In the middle of the sky, a shadow of a man roared down from a high place. Its potential was like thunder. Before people arrived, the wind came. The slightly smaller stones on the ground began to roll slowly. Its power is so powerful that it can be imagined that people can practice.</p>
<p>This night, the villa is actually a gathering of wind and cloud, people from all walks of life.</p>
<p>But, life is more, it is the twists and turns after coincidence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hiss! &quot;</p>
<p>Different from that mysterious figure, although it was fierce, the later one lifted his weight lightly when he landed. He just burst out a sharp howl in the air, which broke the original silence here. When he fell on the ground, he just quietly turned half a circle, and then he stood still without much sound and turned his head to look at the field.</p>
<p>A moment later, he was stunned.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi was stunned.</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi was stunned.</p>
<p>It was as if there was a stream of blood burning in his chest, and his body shook slightly. In front of him, just below the place where he stood, a fat man was standing there. Although his face was gray and his body was strange and bloated, he still recognized it at the first sight Who is he</p>
<p>He opened his mouth slightly, but he couldn&rsquo;t make a sound. For ten years, he seemed to have a thousand words in his stomach, but at this moment, he only turned into silence.</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi looks at GUI Li deeply. No, who cares about that damned ghost? The person he looks at is just the seventh incompetent disciple under his seat. It&rsquo;s Zhang Xiaofan.</p>
<p>Ten years have passed, and the boy is no longer young any more. There is a faint white on his temples. He must have had a hard time in the past ten years! It&rsquo;s not that Tian Buyi didn&rsquo;t think that he would have a chance to meet with the disciple who was rebellious. He even thought about giving a face-to-face reprimand, and then earnestly taught him, hoping that he would return.</p>
<p>However, at this moment, maybe he is really old. He can&rsquo;t say a word of reprimand that he once thought about. At the end of the day, his trembling lips just turned into a faint smile, and then he called out softly, &ldquo;Lao Qi! &quot;</p>
<p>In his fierce mind, he roared and roared. These simple words seemed to break down all his heart walls in an instant. Everything in the past can be clearly seen. On the green and beautiful bamboo peak, the rustling bamboo waves seem to come in bursts.</p>
<p>He was stunned and stood still. His body trembled slightly. Even the monkey little ash crawling on his shoulder did not say a word.</p>
<p>Throat burning general feeling, but there are years of warmth has not been revisited, once upon a time, it was his most precious memory.</p>
<p>At this moment, the man, standing there, is calling for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master! &quot;</p>
<p>In an instant, he seemed to be back in those days, that ordinary teenager who was reckless. He cried out for the excitement that his chest was burning like fire.</p>
<p>There are tears in the corner of the eye.</p>
<p>Flickering quietly. (to be continued. )</p>
