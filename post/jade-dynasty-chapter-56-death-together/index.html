      <p>The xuanhuojian on her chest gradually calmed down, and all the light slowly disappeared. Zhang Xiaofan suddenly realized that the huge fire dragon that had tumbled under him had disappeared at some time.</p>
<p>Really, I don&rsquo;t know how long it took</p>
<p>He was stunned in the local area, and millions of thoughts were stirring in his mind. However, he still felt that there was a blank in his mind.</p>
<p>Six tail white fox was silent for a long time, then slowly raised his head and said to Zhang Xiaofan, &ldquo;young Lang, come here for a while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan slowly walked in the past, and behind him, in the corridor, the whistling wind, has become more and more big!</p>
<p>The six tailed white fox still hugs the unconscious body in front of him. His face is still calm. Even his voice is still as quiet as water: &ldquo;can you do me a favor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan said in silence, &ldquo;what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>White fox looked at the woman in her arms and said quietly, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s throw the two of us into the magma below!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan raised his head and took a step back.</p>
<p>White fox looked at him and said nothing.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan opened his mouth wide, as if he wanted to say something, but he couldn&rsquo;t say a word. He just felt that his eyes were suddenly scorched by fire and began to heat up.</p>
<p>He nodded heavily.</p>
<p>White fox smiles and hugs the woman in her arms.</p>
<p>One step, two steps, Zhang Xiaofan holding two foxes tightly hugged together, towards the end of the platform, and walked away slowly.</p>
<p>The raging heat, at his feet, roared and roared.</p>
<p>Finally, he came to the end, standing on the edge of life and death.</p>
<p>White fox&rsquo;s face, suddenly looked a silk. He looked up at the boy.</p>
<p>Nobody saw Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s expression at the moment.</p>
<p>Then it suddenly smiled, as if all the grudges had been forgotten, just like the old people staring at the youth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young man, why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan didn&rsquo;t speak.</p>
<p>White fox gently picked up the xuanhuojian still on the woman&rsquo;s chest. With his last strength, he pulled up the sleeve of Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s right hand and tied the xuanhuojian to his arm with red silk spikes at both ends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the supreme thing that our Fox family exchanged for countless lives. Give it to you as a souvenir! &quot; It smiled, at the same time, the whole body began to shake violently again, and black blood flowed from the corners of its mouth: &ldquo;however, don&rsquo;t let others see it&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>His voice, finally.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s lower too.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan clenched his lips, took a deep breath, and then released his hands.</p>
<p>In the distance, with a loud bang, Bi Yao and Shi, as well as Li Xun and Yan Hong from the burning incense Valley, shot out of the corridor like electricity and appeared on the platform. Just in time, Zhang Xiaofan saw the two foxes. Into the magma.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan stood at the end of the platform, unaware of what happened behind him, staring at the figure rolling in the air.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know where the wind swept his skirt.</p>
<p>There is a light flash, the gentle woman in the turn of the graceful, off the world&rsquo;s clothes, showing the real body, a beautiful three tail fox.</p>
<p>Two foxes, who lost their lives but were still beautiful, hugged and rolled in the air. Go down. Until with a low voice, they melted into the lake, never to be seen again.</p>
<p>Biyao is a little worried. She goes forward. &ldquo;Xiaofan&hellip;&rdquo; cried out</p>
<p>But the young man, if he doesn&rsquo;t hear it, just stays where he is and doesn&rsquo;t move.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>From the Fire Dragon Cave, and then through the dark black stone cave, finally back to the ground. Now. It&rsquo;s already bright.</p>
<p>Everyone took a long breath, including Li Xun and Yan Hong. The look of the two of them is also a little tired. It can be imagined that the monster named &ldquo;big black leech&rdquo;, which was defeated by the four of them last night, is not so easy to deal with.</p>
<p>But only Zhang Xiaofan, somehow, has been silent.</p>
<p>Standing beside him, Biyao asked him softly. Zhang Xiaofan just shook his head.</p>
<p>Li Xun took a look here, came over and said to Zhang Xiaofan, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s really gratifying that younger martial brother Zhang should escape from the great difficulty and escape from the lifeless abyss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan reluctantly smiled, nodded and replied, &ldquo;thank you, senior brother Li.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this time, Yan Hong also came over, and her expression was more relaxed than Li Xun&rsquo;s. she smiled and said, &ldquo;elder martial brother Zhang, you have a profound fortune. If you don&rsquo;t die, you will be blessed.&rdquo; Speaking of this, she suddenly smiled: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s said that when I was in the abyss of the dead spirit, I couldn&rsquo;t find you. Those of your classmates were really in a hurry, especially your elder martial sister Lu&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s heart moved. He raised his head and looked at Yan Hong. However, he saw that she was smiling and looked at Li Xun nearby.</p>
<p>Li Xun felt Yan Hong '</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was moved and leaned slightly. &ldquo;Thank you very much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yan Hong smiles back, but the corner of her eyes catches a glimpse of the woman in green standing beside Zhang Xiaofan. She looks beautiful, but her face is a little gloomy at the moment.</p>
<p>Yan Hong has always been careful, so she immediately left her mind behind. She couldn&rsquo;t help looking at Biyao more. Then she said to Zhang Xiaofan, &ldquo;elder martial brother Zhang, excuse me, these two are&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan turned his head and said, &ldquo;Oh, this one is called Shi Shi. He is a disciple of the righteous cultivator&rdquo; King Kong gate &quot;</p>
<p>Then he said to the stone, &ldquo;brother Shi, these two are senior brother Li Xun and senior sister Yan Hong under the gate of incense valley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Listen to the stone and stand in awe. In the eyes of the world&rsquo;s cultivators, the burning incense Valley is famous. It is not under the famous Qingyun gate. At present, it says: &ldquo;you are polite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li Xun and Yan Hong bow to repay the ceremony. Yan Hong said with a smile, &ldquo;brother Shi&rsquo;s way is very high!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stone face a red, but he is a straightforward person, his face can not help but a bit proud to show up, smile: &ldquo;too much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yan Hong turned around with a smile, looked at Biyao, and said to Zhang Xiaofan, &ldquo;what about this girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan smothers for a while and doesn&rsquo;t speak. Biyao stood beside him, his eyes gradually cold.</p>
<p>But the stone looked at them and said with a smile, &ldquo;this is miss Biyao, a friend of brother Zhang. She has a deep cultivation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li Xun takes a look at Biyao, but sees that she doesn&rsquo;t mean to say hello. He turned his head away. But Yan Hong seemed to be very attentive to Biyao, and smiled: &ldquo;ah! It turns out to be a Baguio girl. I don&rsquo;t know where you come from? &quot;</p>
<p>Biyao looks at Zhang Xiaofan, but sees that he is silent. Suddenly, he sneered and said, &ldquo;I have no family and school. I am born lonely. I help people once in a while, but I am also disliked!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan listened. Frown. Yan Hong looks at her with a smile.</p>
<p>At this time, Li Xun coughed in front of him and said to Zhang Xiaofan, &ldquo;younger martial brother Zhang, I have something to ask you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan dare not neglect, said: &ldquo;elder martial brother Li, please say something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li Xun looked at him and said slowly, &ldquo;younger martial brother Zhang is the first one to enter the Fire Dragon Cave. Can you see a jade ring in the cave or on the white fox? Is there a Fire Totem in the middle and a magic weapon with red silk ears at both ends?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s heart leaped. But the stone beside has shouted: &ldquo;yes! Yes! Last night, when we fought with three evil foxes, we saw her use this magic weapon. &quot;</p>
<p>Li Xun and Yan Hong are happy at the same time, but Yan Hong&rsquo;s mind is more intimate. Turning to Li Xun, he says, &ldquo;how come when we went down last night, the three evil foxes didn&rsquo;t offer xuanhuojian?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li Xun said lightly: &ldquo;she summoned the fire dragon to fight us with the xuanhuojian, which must be on her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yan Hong nodded. Li Xun turned to Zhang Xiaofan and said, &ldquo;younger martial brother Zhang, that xuanhuojian is a treasure of our school, and it has a lot to do with it. Don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve ever seen it? &quot;</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s eyes were on Zhang Xiaofan for a while. Zhang Xiaofan took a deep breath and was silent for a moment. He said lightly, &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li Xun is stunned. Frown.</p>
<p>Yan Hong&rsquo;s eyes turned on Zhang Xiaofan and said, &ldquo;why, when elder martial brother Zhang and three evil foxes and the six evil foxes fight, didn&rsquo;t they use the xuanhuojian?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was silent for a moment again, and said: &ldquo;last night, after I accidentally hit the Fire Dragon Cave, I found the white fox. That is to say, the six Tailed Fox is dying of serious illness. When the three evil foxes come in, they may be fighting with the four of you outside, which is also a great loss of vitality. I didn&rsquo;t put much effort into it, so I beat them down</p>
<p>Yan Hong and Li Xun both look disappointed at once. Yan Hong turns around and looks at Li Xun. Li Xun lightly says: &ldquo;before I came out of the Fire Dragon Cave, I had looked for the nearby place carefully. There was no sign of xuanhuojian. I was afraid that I fell into the magma with them and was buried with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yan Hong sighed and said, &ldquo;come on, elder martial brother Li, anyway, we have got rid of the remaining evils of the evil fox, and we have an explanation for the school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li Xun nodded, then turned to Zhang Xiaofan and other three people and bowed to them, saying, &ldquo;since that&rsquo;s the case, my younger martial sister and I still need to go back to the incense Valley and report to the school, let&rsquo;s go first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan and shitoulian said: &ldquo;please help me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Only Biyao is still very sad, standing on one side, still motionless.</p>
<p>Li Xun nodded and said to Yan Hong, &ldquo;younger martial sister, let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yan Hong smiles and nods, but suddenly remembers something. Turning around, she says to Zhang Xiaofan, &ldquo;elder martial brother Zhang, the demon sect is ready to move recently. Qingyun sect will meet other righteous people in Liubo mountain in the East China Sea. I heard that your master has all gone. Why don&rsquo;t you go to meet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was startled, then his face brightened and said, &ldquo;really? They all went to Liubo mountain! Then I&rsquo;ll go at once. &quot;</p>
<p>Yan Hong smiled and nodded, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s all right, I&rsquo;ll go back to the school with elder martial brother Li. Maybe we&rsquo;ll see each other then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, she turned around and walked a few steps with Li Xun. Suddenly, Yan Hong turned around and smiled at Biyao and said, &ldquo;girl Biyao, the golden bell on your waist is really beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as Biyao&rsquo;s face changed, the golden bell at her waist was naturally the &ldquo;Huan magic bell&rdquo; left by Mrs. Jinling when she and Zhang Xiaofan were trapped in the blood dripping hole under the lifeless abyss.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, Yan Hong said that she was almost mistaken that the gentle female disciple of the burning incense Valley had seen through her identity.</p>
<p>But Yan Hong only said this sentence, but it was as if nothing happened. She just smiled at her and left with Li Xun.</p>
<p>Biyao frowned and wondered. Suddenly she felt something and looked aside. Zhang Xiaofan also looked at her.</p>
<p>At present, the three people also left the forest outside the Blackstone cave. After the full moon well last night, Biyao remembers that three evil foxes asked Zhang Xiaofan several times what he saw inside. He also asked him a few words. Zhang Xiaofan was stunned at first, but he didn&rsquo;t answer. He just shook his head.</p>
<p>Since Bagao was angry, she stopped asking him. But in my heart, I was very curious, and went to the past. She looked down from the ancient well, only to see the deep well, clear water, reflecting her face. It&rsquo;s very beautiful, but there is no other difference, so I don&rsquo;t care about it.</p>
<p>When they got out of the woods, they went back to Xiaochi town. The mayor and other people had been waiting for their anxieties. When they saw their figure, they immediately surrounded them.</p>
<p>When hearing the stone loudly say that the evil has been removed and that all the villagers can live in peace in the future, all the people are in high spirits.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan stands by. Looking at the joyful crowd, I felt confused for a while. In front of me, I saw the figures of the two evil foxes.</p>
<p>When Li Xun asked him about xuanhuojian, he naturally knew that what they were looking for was actually tied to his arm, but somehow he remembered what the white fox said.</p>
<p>In fact, he met with the six evil foxes for only one night, and he could not talk about any friendship. However, seeing the three evil foxes commit suicide, the six evil foxes embrace her and jump into the hot magma together. The thrilling scene is still in front of him.</p>
<p>He was deep in his heart. Unexpectedly, he had a close heart to the demon fox, so he inexplicably pushed them away from him and concealed the truth from them.</p>
<p>Stone finally got out of the crowd and winked at them. Zhang Xiaofan and Biyao look behind him. I can only see that all the villagers still want to be around with smiles on their faces.</p>
<p>Stone turned to all the people and said, &ldquo;listen to me, everyone. This is the end of the matter. We will continue to practice, and we will leave here today. As for the silver thank you thing. I thank you with these two companions, but the silver is an external thing. It&rsquo;s useless. Please come back! &quot;</p>
<p>After that, he walked quickly, pulled Zhang Xiaofan and whispered, &ldquo;go quickly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The common people saw that the three people had made a few electric lights, and then they could not see the figure with two whistles. They were so sad that they got together and discussed for a while, and then they gradually dispersed.</p>
<p>But after the crowd dispersed, at the corner of the street, there was an old man and a young man coming out, looking at the direction where the three of them disappeared. It was the fortune teller Monday Xian and his granddaughter Xiaohuan.</p>
<p>On Monday, the immortal looked in that direction and saw that there was no one left or right. He whispered to Xiaohuan, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine that the three evil foxes, though they have xuanhuojian in hand, were still given away by these people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan took a bunch of newly bought ice sugar gourd in her hand and ate it with relish, saying: &ldquo;if that magic weapon is really as powerful as you said, how can three evil foxes do something? In my opinion, those who have learned from XuanHuo are mostly in vain. &quot;</p>
<p>The immortal frowned on Monday and said: &ldquo;xuanhuojian is an ancient artifact. There is no doubt that most of the three evil foxes are not good enough, so they can&rsquo;t use all the power of xuanhuojian.</p>
<p>Besides, last night, there were two more powerful people in the burning incense valley. She is also doomed! &quot;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan glanced at him and said, &ldquo;you say, who got the xuanhuojian?&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Monday, the immortal shrugged his shoulders and said: &ldquo;most of them were taken back by the two disciples of the burning incense valley. Forget it, alas! I wanted to go in and see if there was anything good. I didn&rsquo;t expect&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>Small ring &ldquo;poof&rdquo; a, spit out a ice sugar gourd&rsquo;s core, way: &ldquo;then where are we going now, Grandpa?&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Monday, Xianwei pondered and said: &ldquo;I heard that the characters of Zhengmo and Wudao are going to the East China Sea one after another. I don&rsquo;t know why. What&rsquo;s more, the direction of those three people just now is the East. Let&rsquo;s go and have a look! &quot;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan smiled and said, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go! It&rsquo;s the same everywhere we go. &quot;</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>After Zhang Xiaofan and others left, Xiaochi town recovered its former calm. Naturally, there were no monsters in the black stone cave to harm the people. But strangely, not long after that, there were many wild animals in the forest outside Blackstone cave, some of them were strange, and the people in Xiaochi town had never seen them before.</p>
<p>In the following days, nine out of ten people who accidentally entered the forest never came out again. However, these monsters have a feature that they will not come out of the forest. Later, the people of Xiaochi town found this, and no one went to the forest.</p>
<p>As time goes on, the place becomes more and more desolate, uninhabited and forgotten. What happened in the forest.</p>
<p>After Zhang Xiaofan and others left, the people in Xiaochi town lamented. In the east of the town, they built an immortal Temple together, offering three Immortals: one is strong and tall, like a King Kong, and the other is a man and a woman. The woman is pretty, but the man is very strange. He has something like a fire stick in his hand.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Later years are far-reaching, and later generations have long forgotten about today&rsquo;s events. However, the fragrance of Xianren ancestral hall in Xiaochi town is very strong. Although there are many studies of good people, they can&rsquo;t guess which way the gods are in the sky. They are the land Bodhisattvas in Xiaochi Town, but they don&rsquo;t seem to be.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I have Reiki after receiving incense for a long time. It&rsquo;s said that those who come to this immortal temple to pray to God are very effective.</p>
<p>After the fame spread, people from ten miles and eight townships nearby also came to visit. Some of them blessed the rich, some prayed to be officials, and later the pregnant women begged to have children. They even came to visit the statues of stone and others.</p>
<p>I wonder how the three of them would feel if they knew about it?</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Note 1: &ldquo;the spirit is different? The beast chapter&rdquo; &ndash; big black leech: an ancient alien, living in a dark crypt. The body is huge, ten Zhangs high, tentacles, more than a few Zhangs long, eating meat, and those who are near will eat without plunder, without seeing bones. (to be continued. )</p>
