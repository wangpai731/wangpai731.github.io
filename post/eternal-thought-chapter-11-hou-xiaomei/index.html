      <p>Go to &ldquo;small talk → net&rdquo; to provide you with wonderful novels to read. A kind of Go to &ldquo;small talk → net&rdquo; to provide you with wonderful novels to read.</p>
<p>This is the first reaction in his mind after hearing Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s words. However, he hesitated when his eyes fell on the two evil meat mountains behind Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun, with a smile on her face, looks lovely. People and animals walk on a few steps innocuously, patting the shoulder of the horse face servant and opening his mouth with a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Congratulations, elder martial brother, who is about to become a foreign disciple. From then on, you can make a great leap forward in the future. But I have worked hard to get here. Do you think you should give me some compensation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The horse face factotum looks ugly. If he doesn&rsquo;t understand the meaning of the other party, he&rsquo;s really living in vain for so many years. He looks at Bai Xiaochun, and looks at Zhang daphou and Heisan Pang. His face is cloudy and sunny, and his thoughts are fast spinning to measure gains and losses.</p>
<p>Soon, Ma Lian young man bit his teeth hard. If he gave up this opportunity, he would not be reconciled. Waiting for a month is a small matter. But who knows if he will meet other strong men next month, and the three people in front of him Maybe next month.</p>
<p>The most important thing is that he is eager to become a disciple of the outside world. At the moment, the hope is in front of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much compensation do you want?&rdquo; He said, gritting his teeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much, not much. I have prepared for this trial for several months. In this way, you can give me twenty spirit stones.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun was so excited that the lion opened his mouth. The horse faced youth&rsquo;s heart trembled. When he was about to turn down his sleeve, Bai Xiaochun opened his mouth again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not younger martial brother. I want more. You see we are three people. You can&rsquo;t just give me one. My eldest and third elder martial brothers are hungry and thin for this test.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun really didn&rsquo;t lie. Zhang and Hei San Pang had lost a small circle in order to speed up.</p>
<p>The horse face worker looked at Zhang daphou and heisanpang. He scolded him a lot and haggled with Bai Xiaochun. Finally, he settled on the sixteen spirit stones. Finally, he put up a pocket for Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right.&rdquo; His voice was hoarse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No problem, elder martial brother, wait. We&rsquo;ll open the door together after two more.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun throws the spirit stone to Zhang daphou and opens his mouth with joy.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why I have to wait for two more. However, I have some expectations in my heart. If I&rsquo;m not good, you can&rsquo;t think about it.</p>
<p>At the same time, the two outer disciples beside the exit saw the transaction with their own eyes, showing an unbelievable look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You What are you doing? How dare you sell the number of disciples from other schools openly The two disciples of the outer gate immediately became stern and growled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want to shout? We&rsquo;re tired after climbing here and don&rsquo;t want to climb. Can&rsquo;t we give it to our classmates? When our classmates see that we&rsquo;re so hard, we can&rsquo;t take the initiative to give us some compensation.&rdquo; Zhang daphou is counting Lingshi happily. He turns his head and stares at the two disciples.</p>
<p>What he said was that the two foreign disciples were speechless for a while, and they didn&rsquo;t know how to refute it.</p>
<p>At this time, on the steps of the trail, seven or eight people were blushing, panting like thunder, struggling fast. The front one was a man in his thirties. The man in his thirties was wearing his upper body, and he was fierce. After walking up the mountain step by step, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s eyes lit up and rushed forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This elder martial brother, you are a step late, but my elder martial brother suddenly doesn&rsquo;t want to be an outside disciple. Do you want this quota?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The big man was stunned for a moment. After hearing Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s words, he saw so many people on the top of the mountain. He immediately understood it and snorted coldly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You little boy dare to blackmail me. Get out of here!&rdquo; With a low roar, he raised his right hand and waved it violently, and the spiritual pressure of three layers of condensed gas suddenly dispersed.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun stepped back and yelled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Big brother!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Almost in the moment when Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s words spread out, a mountain of meat came and fell from the sky.</p>
<p>The big man&rsquo;s face changed greatly. When he looked up at the top, a roar came, and the meat Hill knot fell on him.</p>
<p>After hearing the scream of the great man, he was directly seated under his body. After struggling for a long time, he was unable to climb out of the meat mountain. If he had not been healthy, he would have fainted.</p>
<p>This scene was seen by the seven or eight laborers behind the big man, and they were all stunned.</p>
<p>The two other disciples also took a breath at this moment. They could not help but sympathize with the man who was crushed under Zhang&rsquo;s body and seemed to be shrinking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Senior brother, someone is watching.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun turns her eyes and whispers at Zhang daphou&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>Zhang daphou, who has been in contact with Bai Xiaochun for more than a year, immediately understands that the bull&rsquo;s eye stares and blows his fist the size of a hammer at the big man under him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you dare to eat for nothing in front of the fat man, you are so bold!&rdquo; Zhang Dazhou punches down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our brothers have worked hard to come here to become disciples of other schools. Do you want to compensate too much for giving up temporarily?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your grandmother, you dare to refuse!&rdquo; As he said this, Zhang dabong not only used his fist, but also raised his body to sit again and again. He screamed and almost broke his breath. Seeing Zhang&rsquo;s body lift up again, the big man, with a look of fear, struggled to stretch out a hand, raised a pocket, and opened his mouth in a loud voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make it up to you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Da Pang got up quickly and took the big man into his breath. His face showed joy. He grabbed his pocket and looked at it. He immediately went forward to take a picture of the dust on his clothes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha ha, my dear brother, you said earlier. Come here, wait in line there. If we have another one, we will open the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The big man was aggrieved and dare not to speak. He came to the side of the horse face worker. He was very depressed. However, he felt very comfortable and felt very wise before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The elder martial brother is mighty!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s face was almost full of laughter, especially when he saw those people behind the big man stopped at the moment, and their faces were startled.</p>
<p>With a proud face, Zhang daphou staggered to the exit, blocked the door and sat down again.</p>
<p>The two outer disciples outside the exit looked at each other. They thought that the three guys had gone too far and extorted money. But now, it seems that they were gentle before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They They dare to rob them! &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is robbery!&rdquo; They were angry and envious at the bottom of their hearts. They felt that they had not thought of such an idea.</p>
<p>Compared with them, the most mixed feelings in their hearts were the seven or eight laborers who came up behind the big man. They saw the whole process of the big man sitting under Zhang daphou. Now they stood there one by one, but the strange light appeared slowly in their eyes.</p>
<p>It was very difficult for them to become disciples of other schools, but now such a delay seems There&rsquo;s a chance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Senior brothers, there is still one last quota, so good, the one with higher price will get it!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun is a man of many talents. When he saw this scene, he immediately opened his mouth. His voice was so sharp that it spread all around, as if he had detonated the thoughts in people&rsquo;s hearts, making the heavy breathing sound suddenly strong.</p>
<p>The original strangeness of the seven or eight miscellaneous items suddenly enlarged infinitely, and one heart after another thought of accelerating the beating of the heart rose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have ten spirit stones!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eleven!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to fix the quota. I&rsquo;ll give 15 spirit stones!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment, the voices of bidding came and went, as if this place had become an auction house, and the three people were more and more excited.</p>
<p>However, the two outer disciples who fell at the door added fuel to the fire. In their eyes, extortion was not enough, even if it was robbery. However, they opened an auction house here, and immediately their minds were buzzing. The absurd feeling in their hearts was like a storm. They thought that the most hateful of the three was not Zhang Da Pang, but Bai Xiaochun, who looked clever!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too much, too shameless!&rdquo; One of them clenched his teeth and his eyes were red. He didn&rsquo;t know whether he was jealous or angry. He quickly turned around and went far away to inform the Deacon.</p>
<p>Seeing that the bidding continues, Bai Xiaochun still feels that it is not fierce enough. She turns her eyes and opens her mouth again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Senior brothers, please hurry up. Otherwise, the time will be delayed for a long time, and other fellow laborers will climb up. For them, this is an opportunity to sell themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as his words came out, a woman&rsquo;s voice came with excitement on the way of trial behind the crowd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I, Hou Xiaomei, have 30 spirit stones! My family is Xiuzhen family. There is no lack of spirit stone. Who dares to rob me? &quot; Talking is a young girl, white skin, small body, and a little pure, now is panting to climb up.</p>
<p>As soon as Zhang daphou saw this young woman, his eyes were straight. He was trying to say something, but he could not help but aim at Xiaochun.</p>
<p>With Hou Xiaomei&rsquo;s bidding, all the people who offered prices to each other immediately exploded. The price suddenly soared. At the end of the day, Hou Xiaomei, who claimed to be the descendant of Xiuzhen family, directly offered a price that made both the young horse faced man and the big man feel frightened, and even felt that she had taken advantage of it.</p>
<p>After a while, Hou Xiaomei walked out of the crowd with her bulging chest and looked at the people behind her with contempt. Only then, with the young horse faced youth with a bitter smile in her heart and the man who claimed to be Lord wolf, they went to the last step and stepped out of the test place.</p>
<p>Behind them, Bai Xiaochun three people clasped fists and deeply worshipped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Congratulations to the three Taoist friends. Since then, the fish have leapt over the dragon&rsquo;s gate and have made great achievements.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The horse face factotum and others stood on the top of the mountain in a trance. Although they became disciples of other schools, they found that they did not have much joy in their imagination. The words of Bai Xiaochun and others echoed in their ears. When they looked at each other, they could only smile bitterly.</p>
<p>Only Hou Xiaomei, who has a sky high price around her, is excited and excited. Her pretty face is now red.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect Hou Xiaomei to meet such a good thing.&rdquo; Hou Xiaomei thinks of it with pride.</p>
