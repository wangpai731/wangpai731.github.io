      <p>Strange breath, with the heat wave, wave by wave reverberates in this empty space. The dragon was fierce, but it did not continue to expand. It seemed that the current appearance was its limit. Rao is so, in that blazing fire, even the hard surface of the ground began to have cracks, on the contrary, it seems that the old and crude brazier, on the contrary, is safe and sound.</p>
<p>The fire was blazing and reflected in the eyes of the beast God, as if his eyes were burning.</p>
<p>At the other end of the flame, the woman&rsquo;s voice gave a faint smile and said, &ldquo;are you really out of your power, or are you deliberately cheating me? Although it is said that this array is not prompted by the dark fire, and it was destroyed at the time of your rebirth, its power is far from that. &quot;</p>
<p>There was no fluctuation on the handsome face of the beast God. He said calmly, &ldquo;since you are so wary of me, I don&rsquo;t know why you have to come to save me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman snorted and said, &ldquo;I have told you for a long time. First, I am for the strange array handed down by the ancient witch clan. The other is that I don&rsquo;t like the old man Yun in the burning incense valley</p>
<p>The God of the beast laughed and didn&rsquo;t seem to take the woman&rsquo;s words to heart. He said, &ldquo;although Yun Yilan broke his promise, I didn&rsquo;t really believe him. If I won the battle of Qingyun Mountain that day, he would not dare to do so. Is that what most people do</p>
<p>The woman said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a pity that he still doesn&rsquo;t know. You and I are different. You can&rsquo;t be killed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The beast God&rsquo;s eyes are deep, slowly staring at the darkness behind the fire, the flame, but it seems that it can not shine into that place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know that I can&rsquo;t be killed? What would you think if I told you now that I could be killed? &quot;</p>
<p>He stares at the dark place, but the corner of his mouth seems to have a faint smile, as if with a bit of provocation, but also a bit of temptation. Slowly tunnel.</p>
<p>The woman suddenly stopped talking. It seemed that there was only the sound of the flame burning in the cave, but I didn&rsquo;t know why. But seems to be more dead than when there was nothing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how long after that, the beast god suddenly said, &ldquo;how many years have we known each other to this day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a long time, the woman said faintly, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t remember.</p>
<p>Not long after I was enlightened, I came here by mistake. Why did you treat me differently</p>
<p>The God of the beast laughed and slowly lowered his head. His face seemed to be more tired and said, &ldquo;although I was not a human being at that time, I couldn&rsquo;t stand being lonely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman was silent again, as if surprised. After a long time, she said, &ldquo;why do you look different today? You never said that before</p>
<p>The beast God&rsquo;s shoulder trembled. Issued two violent coughing sound, but still with a faint smile on his face, as if in his eyes, what is indifferent: &ldquo;you have seen people dying, can it be the same as usual?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Almost immediately, the woman continued, &ldquo;but you are not a human being.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know I&rsquo;m not a human being?&rdquo;</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>The fire in the brazier suddenly rises, like a silent roar of a fire dragon, and then slowly falls down. The eight mysterious patterns of ferocity around it also slowly fall down, and the light is dim. Gradually disappeared into the darkness. The fire dragon gradually integrated into the fire and turned into ordinary fire light. The surroundings were dark one by one, and only there was some light around the brazier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you done to yourself?&rdquo; After a long time. Asked the woman softly.</p>
<p>The beast God did not answer or speak. He looked more and more tired and slowly raised his hand. In the light of the fire, the skin of his right wrist seemed to lose its luster and gray. There is also a dark red pulse hidden in the wrist muscles.</p>
<p>The beast God looked at the pulse for a moment, shook his head, and gently scratched his wrist with his hand. After a moment, a hole appeared on the wrist, and then a drop of blood slowly overflowed.</p>
<p>Blood!</p>
<p>Red blood!</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could&hellip;&rdquo; The woman in the dark seemed so surprised that she couldn&rsquo;t even speak. After a long time, she seemed to come back to her senses and said, &ldquo;you You have become a man</p>
<p>Beast God did not speak, just smile, so silent smile, no one knows whether it is a bitter smile or a happy smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no wonder that I always wonder that you were born of the evil spirit of heaven and earth. You should be the place where you can not die. How could you get such a big wound under the sword of killing immortals at the top of Qingyun Mountain. Originally you actually do not know when, become you always dislike person? Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>The woman did not know whether it was too absurd or difficult to control herself, but she laughed.</p>
<p>The beast God&rsquo;s eyes, staring at the drop of red blood on his wrist, twinkled with complex emotions, like joy and sadness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never, I hate people&hellip;&rdquo; He smiles wearily, &ldquo;I can come to this world, I have my mind and consciousness, isn&rsquo;t that what people do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman was stunned and said, &ldquo;what are you talking about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The beast God slowly raised his head and looked at the burning fire in the brazier. His voice, in the place where darkness and light alternately twinkled, seemed to return to the long past.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first time I was conscious, I saw her. At that time, I didn&rsquo;t even have a body, but in a trance, the woman seemed to stare at me. But with the passage of time, I gradually formed, and finally learned that she was a human being, a witch of that generation, and her name was Linglong. &quot;</p>
<p>Taotie roared at the side of the beast God.</p>
<p>The animal God stretched out his hand and stroked its head twice. Taotie was quiet. The woman had no voice at all. It seemed that she knew that the secret of countless time in the past years was to be uncovered.</p>
<p>In the eyes of the beast God, gentleness slowly occupied all positions. His eyes also looked to the remote dark depths, the distance of the cave, where there may have been a soul, listening quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is Linglong&rsquo;s Witchcraft and secret arts, which is the essence of heaven and earth in the south of Xinjiang, and distilled the essence from it to create me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The beast God said faintly, this secret that has puzzled for thousands of years, no one has ever known his origin. &ldquo;Those so-called heroes of the sorcerer clan, following Linglong, must put me to death. If you know that I was created by their respected mother. I don&rsquo;t know what kind of mood they will feel</p>
<p>He smiles, the past of those killing and anger, it seems that never existed in his body, now he has. It&rsquo;s just a memory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have asked Linglong many times why she wanted to make me, but she never said. But I finally understood that she was only for two words. &quot;</p>
<p>The woman couldn&rsquo;t help but ask, &ldquo;what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Long life!&rdquo; said the beast God</p>
<p>The woman&rsquo;s voice was slightly surprised: &ldquo;long life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The beast God nodded and said, &ldquo;yes. You think it&rsquo;s funny, too? But that&rsquo;s what she did that day.</p>
<p>At that time, she was much more exquisite and accomplished than the ancients. Looking at the world, she was almost invincible, and all the people in the sorcerer family revered her like a God. What she did when she was bored was to find another target for herself. This sounds similar to those in the middle earth today, but it&rsquo;s a mystery of longevity. This is the way of heaven. Although she is a woman of unparalleled intelligence, she can never break through it. Finally, one day, she thought of an inhuman way</p>
<p>&ldquo;Inhuman&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are limits to the life span of a person. Even if he has accomplished his cultivation, he will only live for hundreds of years. However, non-human things often have a longer life, and the creation of heaven and earth, yin and Yang, and so on, have been since the opening of heaven and earth. He who never dies. Since she thought of it, she studied it carefully, and finally she created me in the lifeless world. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s really amazing&hellip;&rdquo; The woman&rsquo;s secluded tunnel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, hey.&rdquo; The beast God gave a faint smile. &ldquo;Yes! She is really a remarkable woman. From the moment I came into this world, I woke up and saw her. Then I do not know how many years, my world is only her. Slowly, I began to take shape, and because my body was born of the anger of heaven and earth. Now that we have divine consciousness, nature begins to absorb the anger around us and gradually becomes stronger. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, she seems to be a little uneasy, looking at my eyes, gradually no longer so kind, when my strength finally began to compete with her, from that day on, she never laughed at me again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was very puzzled at that time. I didn&rsquo;t know what it was for. In fact, I didn&rsquo;t know why. My strength grew so fast, but for me, what was the meaning of power! I just want to be with her I just want to be with her. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can tell her, she will know?&rdquo; The woman couldn&rsquo;t help saying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said, said many times, now think of it, probably with the child to the mother coquetry almost &ldquo;But she never believed it!&rdquo; he said</p>
<p>The woman was silent and did not speak for a long time, and the beast God was silent, as if immersed in memories.</p>
<p>The flame, still burning in the brazier, fluttered gently in mid air, and seemed to be panting.</p>
<p>Time in this dark place seems to stop, listen!</p>
<p>The past years is the freezing of memory ice, bit by bit melting, and then slowly disappear.</p>
<p>Who can save it?</p>
<p>Are you or me? Or are we, in fact, all of us, panting and running in time, but after all, we can&rsquo;t catch up with the time, gradually getting old and disappearing in the shadow</p>
<p>&ldquo;At last, one day, I don&rsquo;t want to stay in the room that only has her. I want to go out and have a look. That day, she left for a long time and never came back. I broke her ban, opened the door of her house and came out</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are many, many, many people But when everyone saw me, they were scared to cry out and run for their lives. I didn&rsquo;t know why, at that time, I was very frightened, and then I was angry. Finally, I felt a strong anger in my heart. At this time, more than a dozen soldiers from the wind began to kill me. I parried and retreated. I didn&rsquo;t want to fight with them. I regret it. I just want to be with my Linglong. I just want to have a look at it&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tried my best to say and explain, but no one listened until I killed the first one by mistake&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A long silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The young soldier fell upside down in my hand, slowly lowered his head, and his body was bleeding with bright red blood. I froze, others also froze, and then they rushed more ferociously, in their drinking and swearing, I clearly heard crying in the distance, it was the soldier&rsquo;s relatives crying! I don&rsquo;t know, but since the first time I saw blood. My body has changed. The killing like * * haunts me like crazy. I don&rsquo;t want to kill, but I can&rsquo;t control it. So I started. I killed. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I killed a lot of people, a lot of people&hellip;&rdquo; The beast God lowered his head, but his voice continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I stood in a pool of blood, I don&rsquo;t know how long I&rsquo;ve been standing. Slowly wake up, and then, I see the distance, surrounded by countless people, Linglong back. She looked at me, without blinking at me, pale face. I don&rsquo;t know why. I&rsquo;m scared. I think I&rsquo;m really wrong, but I don&rsquo;t know. I really don&rsquo;t know what I did wrong&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, Linglong did it, and she did it to me herself.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to fight back, I hope to explain to her, I want to say to her, I will never dare to come out again, as long as I stay in that room, from now on, as long as I accompany her, I will be satisfied. I have said that many times. But she didn&rsquo;t listen once. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her magic method is not comparable to those ordinary soldiers. Soon my body was hit with holes, but. Every time these wounds are injured, it will absorb the anger around it to recover. Even I can feel it. Every time Linglong hits me, my strength grows faster. In the end, Linglong discovered this. Her face was as grey as death, as if in despair</p>
<p>The beast God was still smiling and remembering, but there was a little more pain on his face: &ldquo;I slowly began to feel that Linglong really hated me. She was crazy and used various magic methods to deal with me. Although my body was immortal, my heart was really miserable. So I ran away by myself. On the way to escape, all the people I met were scared by me. I didn&rsquo;t know what I looked like at that time. In the eyes of ordinary people, it was really frightening</p>
<p>He patted the evil beast Taotie lying beside him and said, &ldquo;I looked like that at that time, but it was much worse than it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After leaving Linglong, I escaped to 100000 mountains. Soon after, I found this cave and lived here temporarily. But I want to go back, I wholeheartedly, actually just want to be with Linglong. So I finally went back, but it was this array that met me</p>
<p>The fire in the brazier, making a crackling sound, seemed to respond to the words of the beast God.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never thought that there could be such a terrible power in this world. With the power of XuanHuo, the eight fierce XuanHuo array was set up, and the eight wasteland fire dragons were called out. Even though I was immortal, I was severely damaged by the fire and destroyed my body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tried my best to tell Linglong that I didn&rsquo;t want to do anything else. I just wanted to be with her, but she didn&rsquo;t seem to listen at all and wanted to burn me to death. In the end, I fled and fled back to the cave. I don&rsquo;t know why, Linglong, she wants to do this to me, but I&rsquo;m not reconciled. I really want to be with her. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After I came back here, with the help of the unique fierce atmosphere of heaven and earth in 100000 mountains, I replied very quickly. Just when I was going to find her again, she had already chased her. She took seven so-called warriors to the ancient cave, came in and found me</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not surprised, because I was created by her. If someone in the world can deal with me and understand me, who else is there besides her? But I really don&rsquo;t understand, why did she do this to me, I said so much to her, why she didn&rsquo;t listen at all! But this time, Linglong answered me. She said, in fact, everything is her fault. It&rsquo;s her fault to create a monster like me. Because I was born of the evil spirit of heaven and earth, and I was born with the opportunity to kill. If I were allowed to live in this world, I was afraid that all the people in the world would suffer</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tried my best to explain to her that I would not. I just wanted to be with her and I didn&rsquo;t want anything else. But she just a sad smile, said she believed me, in fact, she did not want to be with me, but, but What if she died? &quot;</p>
<p>In the ancient cave, in the remote place, it seems that someone is sighing in the dark. For the scene thousands of years ago, I don&rsquo;t know the tears that fell in those years. Can anyone remember?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was stunned. My heart was blank. I knew I was immortal, but I never thought that Linglong would die. I still remember so clearly, Linglong, in her pale smile, there were tears falling down. Then, once again, she launched the eight vicious battle array, trapped me in it, and burned my body once again, but the essence of the evil spirit that I had made was, after all, she could not destroy it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After the array, she has been greatly damaged, but I was made by her. In the fire, I still asked her, why did you do this to me&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This time, she said nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She put the array of Dharma in this ancient cave, and restrained me, burning it day and night. As long as my anger recovers a little, the burning will burn that anger. At last, she was staring at me and suddenly asked me what else I wanted? &quot;</p>
<p>The beast God gave a low smile and said, &ldquo;wish, what can I have? All I want is to be with her. So I asked her, why can&rsquo;t I be with her? Linglong, she lowered her head and said slowly, because I am not a human being or even a living being, it is doomed that we can&rsquo;t be together</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was in the flames, facing her, said aloud: then you, let me be a man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His voice was suddenly high, and he raised his head and called out to the dome of the cave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me be a man!&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boom&rdquo;, the walls are shaking, falling rocks have fallen, sound like drums, deafening.</p>
<p>In the dust, the beast God slowly lowered his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then, what happened?&rdquo; The woman in the dark.</p>
<p>“…… She seemed to be in a daze for a long time without moving. I suffered from the burning of fire, and I was disillusioned. However, she suddenly stood up, stopped the array and came to my side. I look at her, I don&rsquo;t know what she wants to do</p>
<p>&ldquo;She said to me, low, that she was sorry for me. Then she&hellip; &quot; Speaking of this, the voice of the beast god suddenly began to tremble slightly. &ldquo;She began to chant a long magic spell, slowly pulled out the knife, and then began Cut yourself with a knife and a knife&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; The woman in the dark exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m stunned. No, I&rsquo;m scared. I&rsquo;m really stupid. I don&rsquo;t know what she&rsquo;s doing. Slowly, Linglong, with her own flesh and blood, and even her own bones, she built a skeleton of her body on the ground. Then, she put me on the skeleton. As her incantation became more and more urgent, I gradually integrated into the body, and even the consciousness began to blur slowly. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard her voice getting lower and lower, but she was still saying to me. This is the last thing she can do for me. In the future, as long as someone finds five sacred objects and places them in this skeleton, I can come back from the dead. But after my resurrection, although the demon power is still there, the body is already a person. Since she is a human, it is no longer an immortal body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She said that she was bent on pursuing eternal life, offending heaven, and creating a monster like me. However, she had a bad feeling, which was even more wrong; and because of me, she killed countless lives, which made all the people in the world suffer a lot. And she killed me, but it was Speaking of this, she said nothing more, and my consciousness was gradually disappearing. In a trance, I only heard her say at the end: I will always be with you&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>This sentence, I have never understood.</p>
<p>Until I, thousands of years later, came back from the dead and stood at the entrance of the ancient cave again.</p>
