      <p>The ancient sword of Zhuxian didn&rsquo;t move. At that moment, it seemed that everyone held their breath, but the scene was quiet and terrible.</p>
<p>There was no sound, no roar, and the ghost saw that the magic wand, which had been smashed by a thousand Jun, hit the ancient sword of Zhuxian, but suddenly fell into a pile of cotton and was silent.</p>
<p>With the roar of rage, the figures at the end of the forest leaped. The bodies of the elders of Qingyun gate appeared one by one, and flew over like the wind and the lightning. However, we only saw that the ancient sword of killing the immortals in the field was held in the ghost&rsquo;s hand, and everyone&rsquo;s face changed greatly. After a while, there were more and more people around the Qingyun gate. In such a chaotic time, no one ignored the original prohibitions and rushed into the forbidden area of Qingyun gate.</p>
<p>Among them, there are xiaozhufeng, Wenmin and dazhufeng. When they see the ghostly presence, their faces change greatly. Wen Min and other women in xiaozhufeng immediately see Lu Xueqi lying on one side powerless, and rush to the past to help Lu Xueqi up.</p>
<p>It seems to have been disturbed and touched by many Qingyun disciples. Although the ancient sword of killing immortals is still in the hands of ghosts and Li, its blade has changed somehow.</p>
<p>On the original simple and slightly rough blade, which is not stone or jade, but on the crack of the blade, because of the fierce blow just now, it seems that it has expanded a little bit. But at the moment, the faint red light began to appear in the mouth of the tiny scar. It seemed that the blood that had just been sucked in was alive and began to drum slowly in the depth of the blade.</p>
<p>As the original calm sea, gradually rising waves, brewing unmatched storm, covering the world!</p>
<p>Silence, silence Everyone saw the change of Zhuxian ancient sword, but no one knew what to do. There was no sound in front of the magic moon cave, and everyone held their breath.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know who&rsquo;s heart throbs quietly?</p>
<p>GUI li felt thirsty and subconsciously wanted to release Zhu Xian. But the next moment, he has found that his strength seems to disappear in an instant, a familiar but distant feeling. It&rsquo;s resurrected in his body, and this feeling is what his enemies fear.</p>
<p>The blood essence in Gui Li&rsquo;s body was boiling slowly, and he began to flow outwards. The destination was the ancient sword of killing immortals in his hand.</p>
<p>GUI Li seems to understand something.</p>
<p>He tried to release the ancient sword of Zhuxian, but his hands were weak. At the moment, Zhuxian ancient sword seemed like a awakened demon, holding him tightly and refusing to let him go. It was the soul eating magic wand on his right hand, which was also tightly attached to the blade of Zhuxian ancient sword.</p>
<p>The red light gradually turns from light to thick in the thin mark on the blade of Zhuxian ancient sword. At the same time, it is like blood flowing through blood vessels. The tiny blood color began to spread, flowing rapidly from both sides of the trace towards the two sections of the blade. The simple sword blade is slowly covered by blood red.</p>
<p>Everyone was stunned, including the well-informed elders. At the moment, everyone knows something is wrong, but no one knows what happened, and what should be done?</p>
<p>The ancient sword of killing immortals seems to have ignored people&rsquo;s worries and has been carrying out its own transformation. The faint blood color finally dyed all the sword blades red. A primitive ancient sword has now become a strange and mysterious blood red sword. The sword light is dark red. Slowly flow, like the eyes of the reborn devil, slowly wake up, staring at the surrounding things.</p>
<p>The atmosphere in the field seemed to solidify, until, the man holding Zhu Xian. There was a sudden burst of pain like a heartrending roar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The voice was so shrill that almost all of them were startled. When they noticed the strength, they all focused on the ghost.</p>
<p>His face was pale and his whole body was shaking. The skin on his face and hands which were not covered by clothes began to shrink obviously and rapidly, and gradually became dry.</p>
<p>At the same time, there is a strange whistling sound on Zhuxian ancient sword, and the red light is getting brighter and brighter. People with sharp eyes have already seen that from the left hand holding Zhuxian ancient sword, there is a faint red silk being sucked into the blade of Zhuxian ancient sword.</p>
<p>The scene was extremely strange. There was not a little bit of the righteous manner of Qingyun gate. All the people present were shocked, but no one moved.</p>
<p>Except for Lu Xueqi.</p>
<p>The woman was powerless to lean on the arms of her elder martial sister Wen Min, but at the moment, somehow, she suddenly struggled and seemed to rush to the ghost and the ancient sword of killing immortals. Wen Min is shocked and quickly pulls it. Lu Xueqi struggles for several times, but her body finally fails to fall down. Even though she is very anxious and wants to shout something, she just looks around, but she closes her mouth and leans against the elder martial sister Wenmin who is concerned with her face. She has deep eyes but looks at the man.</p>
<p>It turns out that after tossing and turning, after a thousand thoughts and heartaches, he is actually watching him die so tragically in front of his own eyes?</p>
<p>She was in tears!</p>
<p>Finally, I can&rsquo;t control the other people&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>The red light on the ancient sword of killing immortals has become more and more prosperous. On the contrary, the situation is more and more ugly. Now anyone can see that under the &ldquo;divine power&rdquo; of the ancient sword for killing immortals, the evil spirit and the righteous way are on the verge of dying. Maybe, this is also the magic sword channeling spirit. Use the method to kill the demons!</p>
<p>Many people think of it quietly, but they don&rsquo;t want to think about it. Is this idea reasonable or unreasonable!</p>
<p>GUI Li naturally didn&rsquo;t think of it and didn&rsquo;t have the time to think about other people&rsquo;s thoughts at the moment. At this moment, he was struggling in front of the ghost gate. The power of sucking and swallowing on the ancient sword of Zhuxian was more and more powerful. Even for him, it was bigger than when he met the blood sucking beads in the back mountain of Dazhu peak when he was young. But now his cultivation of Taoism is not comparable to that of that young man, which has been supporting him to the present. However, he also knows that he can not support for long.</p>
<p>The uncanny sucking power of Zhuxian ancient sword is similar to that of blood swallowing beads in those years, but there are differences. Compared with blood swallowing beads, the power of killing immortals is greater now. Moreover, it is different from that of blood swallowing beads. At the same time, Zhuxian ancient sword absorbs the Qi of Zhenyuan, which has been practised in the ghost and Li for many years.</p>
<p>In Gui Li&rsquo;s eyes at the moment, the ancient sword of killing immortals in front of him is emitting blood red light. It looks like a demon, opening his bloody basin and grinning grimly, and is about to swallow him up.</p>
<p>Is this the end of your life?</p>
<p>The thought flashed through his mind just before he fell into a coma.</p>
<p>A burst of heat burst out of his heart. It is pure Yang breath, which spreads into meridians. His whole body was shocked, his mind was clear for a moment, and he roared. He devoted his whole life to practice and raised his strength. His mind flashed like thunder and lightning. The three volumes of the book of heaven flashed by in a twinkling of an eye. Although it is not bright, it is still alive.</p>
<p>The great Brahma Prajna stands in the heart, and the Buddhism adheres to the true dharma. The ancient sword of killing immortals is also a meal for it. Taking advantage of this moment to gasp, Taiji Xuanqing road is the road. The ghostly right hand is twice as thick in an instant. The dark red light rushes by, and in a twinkling of an eye, it is injected into the soul eating magic stick.</p>
<p>However, just as the ghost was about to fight back to escape, the power of the ancient sword of Zhuxian had broken through the great Brahma Prajna again, and the ghost was paralyzed in an instant. Can&rsquo;t move any more, but in the mind that silk clear, once again dim down.</p>
<p>At the moment, in other people&rsquo;s eyes, the ghostly face withered, which was not far from the dead. Song Daren and other people who had some friendship with Zhang Xiaofan in the past turned their heads and couldn&rsquo;t bear to see it again.</p>
<p>At this time, it seems that the overall situation has been settled, but the ghost wand in the ghost&rsquo;s hand suddenly lights up. Dark green light slowly drum, such as sleep slowly wake up, the top of the blood phagocytic bead, road road road monster red blood silk. Once again, and the bead deep, it was unprecedented, in the dark blue light and blood, covered with golden Buddhist mantra.</p>
<p>Buddhism, Taoism and magic are the three true dharmas at this moment. Suddenly, he was really integrated into one in the fierce and fierce dying moment.</p>
<p>The blood sucking beads became more and more bright, and the strange but gorgeous light flickered. Then, the whole soul eating magic wand lit up, as if shouting something. A moment later, there was a dull sound again from the interface between soul swallowing and immortal killing ancient sword.</p>
<p>It was only at this time that people noticed again that in addition to the ghostly left hand, the Soul Eater in his right hand had always been connected to Zhuxian and did not fall down.</p>
<p>The light on the blood sucking beads became more and more bright, and the three colors and awns swayed, and the deep voice, like the murmur of ancient demons, was slowly emitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh Oh Oh&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>A piece of red gas is crystal clear. First of all, it is sucked out from the mark of Zhuxian ancient sword and integrated into the soul eating magic stick. It rolls in the blood sucking beads and seems to be still resisting. However, it can be seen that it is subdued by the strange breath inside the blood sucking bead. Slowly, it turns into light red. A small part of it is assimilated by soul swallowing magic wand, and most of it is through soul eating magic stick New input into the body of ghost.</p>
<p>This strange change never stopped once it started. It sucked red Qi from the ancient sword of killing immortals. With more and more red Qi absorbed, the enhanced soul biting light became more and more prosperous, and the replenished ghostly complexion gradually recovered, and the face and skin gradually recovered from dryness, showing a kind of faint and moist color.</p>
<p>The red light on the ancient sword of Zhuxian is dazzling from the red light at its peak. At the moment, it seems that there is no way to do anything about the blood sucking demon sucking power. It is gradually fading down, and the soul eating magic stick is more and more bright.</p>
<p>All the people in Qingyun gate are not blind. At the moment, most of them can see that the situation is wrong. Now it is clear that the demon is evil. He does not know what kind of magic tricks he has played in the dark. The ancient sword of killing immortals seems to be irresistible.</p>
<p>After a burst of commotion and uproar, a number of people suddenly scolded in the crowd, and at the same time, several magic weapons and strange lights hit the ghost fiercely. At the moment, GUI Li is fighting with Zhuxian ancient sword wholeheartedly. However, he doesn&rsquo;t pay attention to the surrounding activities, but he doesn&rsquo;t react at all. A moment later, all these magic weapons are firmly hit on GUI Li&rsquo;s back.</p>
<p>The ghost&rsquo;s body was shocked, and his Qi and blood were surging. His throat was sweet and a mouthful of blood gushed out. He was spitting on the ancient sword of killing immortals. The ancient sword of Zhuxian had already been silent. Suddenly, the blood gushed and the red light flashed. It was powerful again. GUI li felt the same feeling. He didn&rsquo;t care about the heavy damage after his death. However, he felt that the strange sucking power of Zhuxian ancient sword suddenly became strong again.</p>
<p>His heart was like lightning and thunder, and he knew that this moment was really the front line of life and death. If Zhu Xian was allowed to gain power again, he was afraid that he would end up being sucked and dried up. Thinking of this, he roared, and then, regardless of everything, exhausted all his strength and cultivated all his life. He just realized the magic power of the three true dharma and fought hard.</p>
<p>The people around him didn&rsquo;t see any action. They just saw that he was attacked by several magic weapons, and the red light of the ancient sword of killing immortals flickered. At the moment when it seemed that it was about to light up, there was a huge roar and sharp sound between the ghost and the immortal, accompanied by several sounds of bone fracture and fracture. The whole person of GUI Li was beaten out by a huge and inexplicable force Arrow of string. Across the heads of the crowd, far into the distant woods.</p>
<p>The people of Qingyun gate were shocked for a moment. They were all in the same place for a long time. Suddenly someone woke up and said, &ldquo;go after me, and you can&rsquo;t let that demon run away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A word to remind people, at that time, countless people in the direction of the fall of the ghost and go. All the people at the scene saw clearly that it was in the fight with the ancient sword of killing immortals that he was severely injured. This is a good time to hunt down this man.</p>
<p>Seeing the people around them rise up in the air and chase away, only dazhufeng and xiaozhufeng are standing in the same place. Song Daren and others don&rsquo;t chase and can&rsquo;t bear to chase, while Wen Min and others are screaming. It turns out that Lu Xueqi has fainted.</p>
<p>When the women of xiaozhufeng were busy rescuing Lu Xueqi, all of a sudden, a very small sound came out in the extremely chaotic noise.</p>
<p>The sound was small, but somehow. As sharp as a fine needle, it pierced into the heart of every Qingyun sect disciple. It was similar to the sound of something breaking quietly, from the ancient sword of Zhuxian beside them.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, all of the people&rsquo;s faces lost their blood color, as if that sound was the echo of the end of the world. They turned their heads slowly, as if the movement would take all their strength.</p>
<p>Under the gaze of all the people, the legendary ancient sword of killing immortals, which is quietly embedded in the stone slab on the ground, has expanded from the narrow scar on the simple blade. Once again, there was a little little crack.</p>
<p>The crack slowly widens, slowly but irresistibly extends around, spreading on the ancient and once sacred blade. Until the ancient sword of Zhuxian sent out again.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Then, with a slight crisp sound, half of the blade was connected with the handle and fell to the ground, while the other half of the blade was still stuck upside down in the ground.</p>
<p>instant. All the people are in a daze, there is no breath, the mind is blank</p>
<p>legend of chusen!</p>
<p>Zhuxian ancient sword!</p>
<p>Broken</p>
<p>Suddenly, there was a huge thunder in the sky. In a twinkling of an eye, there were clouds rolling from all directions. The sky and the earth quickly changed color, and black clouds hung low and gathered at the top of Qingyun Mountain.</p>
<p>The strong wind, sand flying stone, accompanied by wind and rain suddenly arrived, thunder and lightning roared, the sky and the earth roared, the wind and rain suddenly fell.</p>
<p>The heaven and earth, as if also in the general cry!</p>
<p>It is night, heaven and earth wail, the sword died!</p>
<p>The cold rain hit his face like a knife, and his whole body was frozen stiff. In the forest, he could not help but hum.</p>
<p>It has been raining heavily for a whole hour, but there is no weakening trend at all. Although the hour is still in the daytime, the dark clouds are hanging down in the sky, covering the blue clouds. It is as if it is late at night.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the body was seriously injured, relying on the sudden storm, to temporarily avoid the pursuit of the Qingyun gate. It was just that strange duel with Zhuxian ancient sword, especially the last blow. It was hard for him to fight back. He killed him and broke half of his ribs. At the moment, the broken bone pierced into his heart and lung. However, he was still a body of flesh. Every step he took, he was in a cold sweat and his mouth was ringing.</p>
<p>At the moment, GUI li really wants to do nothing but lie on the ground and sleep soundly. He just keeps telling him that he must go. Because of the gratitude and resentment between him and Qingyun gate and his broken body, once he is found by the disciples of Qingyun gate, he is afraid that he will die.</p>
<p>But for him, there is a reason why he can&rsquo;t die after all!</p>
<p>So he tried to bear it, and slowly struggled to run forward. If he was far away from Qingyun Mountain, he would be safer.</p>
<p>Heavy rain, crazy fall to this world, as if to use the water of heaven, to wash the ugly world. He gasped and breathed. Every breath of his mouth was in the dark rainy night, and he breathed out a faint white air. Cold shrouded him, behind him more and more close to the voice of the people, but with the intention of killing.</p>
<p>It is obvious that although the ghost Li tried to escape forward, the seriously injured body was far less rapid than the people searching behind. But Qingyun Mountain was not discovered because of the deep forest and dark sky. However, the ghost sharp heart understood, such and so, after all, is inevitable.</p>
<p>He stumbled under his feet as if he had stumbled over a branch or a vine like thing. He was unstable and fell forward. In his panic, he reached out and grabbed a small tree nearby. Fortunately, he was able to stabilize himself. However, under the violent movements, his chest pain was so deep that he could hardly breathe, let alone run for his life.</p>
<p>The voices behind them suddenly approached, as if in the strong wind and heavy rain, someone still heard the strange voice. Under the command, many people&rsquo;s footsteps searched in the direction of ghosts.</p>
<p>However, he did not want to be captured. Even if he ran for his life at the moment, he could not escape the pursuit. As soon as he was ruthless and closed his eyes, he slipped quietly onto the muddy ground and buried himself in the mud. In the dark, he seems to be a pile of mud abandoned by this stormy world.</p>
<p>Footsteps, noise, slowly gathered over, many people have been drinking and scolding, at the same time do not stop the hands of things pounding the surrounding trees and thorns. The strong wind swept by, I don&rsquo;t know how many people swarmed in.</p>
<p>In the dark, he was still on the ground, and his heart seemed to stop beating. In the dark, he was waiting for the verdict of fate.</p>
<p>Heaven and earth are merciless. Maybe all things are cud dogs</p>
<p>The wind and rain are raging! (to be continued. )</p>
