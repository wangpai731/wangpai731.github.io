      <p>The night is dark and the wind is high, the lights are off, the sky is dark, the clouds are heavy, there is no moon, only the stars in the sky are twinkling.</p>
<p>The night wind &ldquo;swished&rdquo; over Heyang City, like a wild ghost crying at night. It is really chilly and terrifying. I think that there has just been a catastrophe here, and there is no one in the street outside the city. On the long road, there are only a few withered leaves occasionally blown down by the wind, rolling and fluctuating lonely among them, floating far away.</p>
<p>In this strange night, a dark shadow suddenly floated from Heyang city. It was almost not like an entity. It fell quietly outside the city and quickly plundered to the ancient road in the south of Heyang city. After a while, another gray shadow came after him, staring at the shadow.</p>
<p>Naturally, these two men were the Lich and Shangguan&rsquo;s policy of tracking thousands of miles. From the beginning of Southern Xinjiang to today&rsquo;s deep going into the Middle Earth, this pursuit is also regarded as a long time.</p>
<p>Shangguance has a profound magic skill of burning incense Valley and a magic weapon of nine cold freezing ice stabbing. The Lich is very hard to deal with. However, the strange skills of the Lich are always unexpected, which makes shangguance have a headache. He is about to catch him again and again, but he often fails.</p>
<p>If the ordinary people were changed, most of them would have given up. However, Shangguan&rsquo;s policy was under the command of Yun Yilan, the master of the burning incense valley. Most of the lichs had a way to solve the mystery of the sky fire of the ancient witch family in southern Xinjiang. In any case, this was what the burning incense valley was determined to get, and it was hard headed to catch up with it all the way.</p>
<p>However, such insistence is not all useless. The cultivation level of the two men is set there, and the Lich can hardly compete with it in a short time. However, the Lich has been seen by shangguance one by one by virtue of various strange techniques of escape, and gradually he knows that now, the Lich wants to escape the pursuit of shangguance again. It&rsquo;s getting more and more difficult.</p>
<p>Shangguan CE knew this, but the Lich understood it, but he understood it. He was really helpless. If there was a way to get rid of this evil man who was like a bone attached cone, he would have used it many times for thousands of miles. However, shangguance has been famous for nearly a hundred years. At that time, he was a man of great influence in southern Xinjiang, with his Taoism, practice, insight and vision. None of them is superior, far from the second generation disciples of burning incense Valley such as Li Xun.</p>
<p>Although the Lich continued to perform strange magic arts, it was actually seen through one by one. At most, it was concealed for a moment. It seemed that it had escaped a certain distance. But after a while, shangguance finally caught up with him.</p>
<p>In fact, the reason why shangguance, or yunyilan of burning incense Valley, had to capture himself back was already clear in the Lich&rsquo;s mind in several conversations with shangguance. But for him, he was determined not to be captured. This night, I watched the Shangguan chasing closer and closer behind him. However, when the ancient road in front of me quickly retreated backward, there was little blocking the boundary of the hills. On the contrary, the terrain gradually became flat and open, and a wilderness appeared in front of me.</p>
<p>Where else can you escape in such a place?</p>
<p>The Lich grinned bitterly under the black veil and snatched it away, but the wind and lightning behind him. But it&rsquo;s been tight for a while.</p>
<p>At the moment when he was at a loss, he suddenly felt something, as if he had found something, and turned his head to one side. His name is Lich. As the name implies, we can know what kind of magic power he is good at. In addition, his physical constitution is different from that of ordinary people. He is more sensitive to the spirit of ghosts and spirits than ordinary people. This is still on the road. He is in a rush. Still, he was keen to discover that there was a deep and gloomy ghost in the deep side of the ancient Wilderness Road.</p>
<p>The Lich was overjoyed. His body made a sharp turn in the air and turned around abruptly. However, he quickly plundered to the depths of the wilderness. The following Shangguan CE gave a cold hum. His body was like a duckweed. He floated and swung freely and casually. He turned his direction and made great efforts to catch up with him again.</p>
<p>However, after a slight delay, the Lich opened a distance, and his figure was a little blurred, but shangguance didn&rsquo;t worry much. After the long journey, he had already touched the mysterious Lich&rsquo;s whole skills. He didn&rsquo;t expect that he could make any changes. At the moment, he was in a state of mind of cat and mouse.</p>
<p>Spend countless efforts, trace thousands of miles, labor, this is not a good punishment for you?</p>
<p>Shangguan CE sneered in the heart, with the overall situation in the grip of the reassurance, easy to chase down.</p>
<p>Soon, the things that appeared in front of the Lich proved his conjecture. It was really a place full of Yin. In the middle land, it was called the Yizhuang, which was the place where the corpses of dead people had not been buried. However, judging from the dilapidated degree of the courtyard house, it was mostly abandoned for a long time.</p>
<p>The Lich couldn&rsquo;t help being disappointed. According to his original intention, the villa was full of Yin, which was the perfect place for him to perform many strange tricks. However, after being abandoned for a long time, the effect was reduced. In particular, he had several strange skills similar to the ghost Road, which could control the corpse, which was quite powerful. He had no chance to cast it all the way. If he took this opportunity to cast a spell suddenly, most of it could be used The old man suffered a great loss.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that the villa has been abandoned for a long time. Naturally, there won&rsquo;t be any corpses lying here.</p>
<p>However, even though he was disappointed in his heart, the Lich could still say that this place was a place where he could find his way out of nowhere. Now he did not hesitate. The black figure &ldquo;whoosh&rdquo; swept into the gloomy and dark house in the villa.</p>
<p>However, as his figure drifted away, a little bewilderment flashed through his mind: the villa had been abandoned for a long time, but how could this gloomy ghost spirit be so strong and lasting?</p>
<p>The night was dark and windy, and the cottage was dark and hard to see. However, for those who practice Taoism, especially those &ldquo;people&rdquo; whose constitution is different from that of ordinary people, such as the lich, this darkness is not difficult. Soon, he can &ldquo;see&rdquo; the general situation in the villa. This place has been abandoned for a long time. The surrounding walls are full of holes and are extremely dilapidated. In the front of the house, a desk originally supposed to be a memorial to the dead has also fallen to the ground. In the middle of the room, there are several broken coffins lying in all directions, some of which have not even closed the coffin covers.</p>
<p>Listening to the wind outside the Yizhuang, it was obvious that hundreds of strategies were coming after him. The Lich did not hesitate, but his body trembled. Suddenly, several strange iron objects like nails appeared in his hands. But his whole body was covered with iron, and then he didn&rsquo;t look at it. His fingers were bouncing like flying, and he only heard the sound of &ldquo;whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh. All of these monsters suddenly disappeared into the darkness and flew into every corner of the hut.</p>
<p>When each monster disappears in the dark, a light blue halo will suddenly appear on the tail end, but it is only a flash, and then it is gone. With these monsters in the darkness of the room. In this room, the originally piercing Yin Qi suddenly became ten times stronger, as if it could penetrate the bone marrow.</p>
<p>With a sneer from the lich, he swept the corner of his eyes, and suddenly his whole body floated up like no weight, and went straight to a coffin in the corner of the room.</p>
<p>The coffin looked plain, and the lid was not well covered. It was half out of the way.</p>
<p>The Lich glided in quietly, but he liked the place that ordinary people could not avoid. And with his body sliding in, the slanting lid of the coffin was covered by him.</p>
<p>The next moment, the wind suddenly stopped, the room suddenly a quiet, no sound, shangguance&rsquo;s figure, appeared in the door of this room.</p>
<p>The Lich hid in the coffin in the corner, and his heart was determined that the coffin was broken. There are several slits on the wood wall. Through the cracks, he can see shangguance&rsquo;s every move clearly. His heart is even more proud, as long as shangguance doesn&rsquo;t pay attention to it for a while. Two more steps to the middle of the room will trigger his &ldquo;Yin magic&rdquo; array. With the help of the extremely strong ghost spirit here, the official thieves will be caught off guard.</p>
<p>He is looking forward to it in his heart, but it seems that the official policy is also very careful, and he is not eager to come in to search for the missing Lich. Instead, he stood at the door and looked carefully into the room. It seemed that he did not dare to come in for a while.</p>
<p>The Lich was somewhat disappointed in his heart, and secretly scolded the old thief that he was really cunning. He came back to God, and slowly began to pay attention to his place.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, he thought about it, but in a moment, he felt that the sound in his mind almost scared him out of his wits.</p>
<p>He was in the coffin, and there was a man!</p>
<p>In fact, because of the particularity of the lich, there is no one in the coffin, that is, there is a dead person. Besides, even if it is a skeleton, he is blind to it. It is hard to guarantee that he will feel a little kind of kindness. But there is a living man in the coffin under him!</p>
<p>But the man was totally undetected by him from entering the hut to sliding into the coffin. He didn&rsquo;t even breathe. The Lich&rsquo;s whole body trembled slightly, but at last he managed to control himself with his remaining reason. He did not shout or break the coffin, but his forehead, back and palm were covered with cold sweat.</p>
<p>But the next moment, what surprised him even more was that the living man under him had no breath Living people without breathing!</p>
<p>In a moment, the Lich had judged clearly that the man in the same coffin was indeed a living man, because there was not much space between them. With his keen sense, he soon realized that the man&rsquo;s heart was beating slowly, but somehow his mouth and nose were still. The Lich reached out quietly and explored it. After a long time, there was no movement. The man did not breathe.</p>
<p>The Lich felt a tingle in his scalp. This strange change happened in front of the Lich. The Lich intended to plot against the official policy, but his mind was so confused that he couldn&rsquo;t concentrate on the essence of his sleeve and his Qi and blood flowed faintly. But after all, he was also a man of profound Taoism. When he thought about it, he immediately found that something was wrong. He hastened to mobilize himself and calm his mind. After a while, he settled down.</p>
<p>However, at this time, when the Lich was planning to face the unexpected situation, a bigger accident made him speechless again.</p>
<p>The whole coffin suddenly made a slight sound: &ldquo;pa!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, something is closed, and the sound is so light that it&rsquo;s almost hard to hear. But in this hut, in the ears of those who practice deeply, it&rsquo;s totally different.</p>
<p>Shangguance almost at the same time, Huoran turned to stare at this corner.</p>
<p>While the Lich was stunned, for a moment, he felt that the coffin he was in suddenly sent out a strange demon force from all directions. The wisps of thread were like hemp, which tightly restrained the space in the coffin. With his magic power, he met this inexplicable demon force, but he had no resistance. In an instant, he couldn&rsquo;t move. He was locked in the coffin by the invisible Demon power.</p>
<p>The soul of the Lich seems to be scared out of the body. However, it seems that it is not enough. At this moment, in the dark space of the coffin, the &ldquo;living man&rdquo; who felt like a fat man under him suddenly woke up and opened his eyes. Two people&rsquo;s eyes. In mid air, in this strange atmosphere, look at each other: then, the unknown fat man, so quietly, to the lich, smile.</p>
<p>Shangguan CE was staring at the corner in the middle of the room, but he did not immediately go to check.</p>
<p>Although he did not have the special constitution of the lich, he could roughly distinguish the scenery in the house with his high moral conduct. At the same time, he knew what kind of place it was.</p>
<p>But he was not a lich. Shangguance never liked the place of Yizhuang, especially for an elderly man. He didn&rsquo;t like this place any more.</p>
<p>At the same time, with his moral conduct, when he first entered the house, he was acutely aware that the flourishing of Yin in this room was really extraordinary, far from being comparable to an ordinary village. What kinds of magic and magic are the Lich proficient in. He is more Puchu than anyone else, and now this place is obviously the place that Xiaoyao likes best, so be careful!</p>
<p>Shangguan instigated the hidden transportation method. Protect the whole body, Zai Zai carefully and again will this strange little house to check a circle, after confirming that there is really no doubt, he slowly steps out.</p>
<p>It was only half of his stride that he suddenly drew back, and the cold light of his right hand flashed. Jiuhanning ice Sting has appeared in the hand.</p>
<p>Old people, it seems, are always very careful. He finally took the first step in the direction of the corner. Outside the house, a gust of overcast wind blows, and the sound of &ldquo;Wuwu&rdquo; is creepy.</p>
<p>Shangguan CE was on guard. He could not escape the slightest change in the hut. However, there was no sound except silence or silence.</p>
<p>With a sneer, he suddenly raised his voice: &ldquo;I already knew you were in this coffin. If you don&rsquo;t come out again, don&rsquo;t blame me for beating people and coffins together, and I&rsquo;ll make you suffer. &quot;</p>
<p>There was no answer, and there was still silence.</p>
<p>Shangguan CE snorted angrily and said, &ldquo;play the devil!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, he did not hesitate to take a step forward. At the same time, the cold light of the nine icy thorns in his hand soared, and the temperature around him suddenly cooled down.</p>
<p>But just as shangguance was getting ready to go, a faint blue light came out of the corner on the other side of the hut. The whole body was wrapped by Yin Qi and attacked the back of shangguance.</p>
<p>Shangguan CE was originally on guard against the surrounding situation. However, the Yin power of this mysterious array set by the Lich completely converged. The whole body could absorb the surrounding Yin Qi and wrap it up. Shangguan CE has a profound practice, and you can feel the Qi pulse here. It is a great magic power. But at this time, it just became a weakness. The Lich saw this point and made a sneak attack.</p>
<p>Shangguance didn&rsquo;t feel anything unusual around him. When the Yin spirit was close to three feet behind him, the wind was sharp and the Yin power was strong. He was frightened. When the lightning was shining, he took a big step forward. When he was born, he opened up a little distance. At the same time, Jiuhan quasi ice stab drifted behind him from his hand. A cold light suddenly appeared, and the silver light suddenly lit up the whole room. However, under this strange atmosphere, the originally beautiful brilliance was pale and white, which made people feel numb.</p>
<p>I saw the silver brilliance emanating from the nine cold ice stabs, and turned into a small piece of light shield on the back of Shangguan CE. At the most dangerous moment, he bounced the evil spirit away.</p>
<p>But before shangguance could breathe for a moment, the big step he had just taken had already touched the evil spirit array set up by the Lich. Suddenly, blue light flashed in several corners of the hut, and several evil spirits mixed with ghostly spirits shot out. What&rsquo;s more, the evil spirit he just opened drew a semicircle in the air, which was like someone pulling one Like, again quietly to the upper official policy back attack.</p>
<p>Shangguance was in a hurry, but he was not ordinary after all. The light of the nine cold ice stabs was shining and the ice awn was pointing at it. After a while, the house seemed to be covered with a thin layer of frost from the roof to the floor.</p>
<p>Under the chilling cold, it seems that the evil spirit which was destroyed by the strange magic power also suffered great resistance, and several flickering demons slowed down one after another. At the same time, Yin charm is like iron and non iron objects, but in this moment, there is a thick layer of ice. Although they are still very fast, they are so slow. He had asked Shangguan to slow down his hand. In the silvery light, the &ldquo;Zheng Zheng Zheng Zheng&rdquo; was repeated several times. Several Yin demons were all knocked down to the ground by jiuhanning ice stab. Most of them are tilted by the cold air of nine cold coagulating ice stabs, but under the ice, the Yin charm falling to the ground is suddenly broken into several pieces.</p>
<p>Shangguan CE managed to turn the corner from the danger and break the evil spirit array of the Lich. He couldn&rsquo;t help laughing and said to the coffin, &ldquo;now you can&rsquo;t do it. Don&rsquo;t you come out and tie your hands &quot;</p>
<p>Before the word &ldquo;capture&rdquo; was uttered, shangguance&rsquo;s face suddenly changed, his face twisted, and he let out a roar of pain. The whole person turned upside down and went out with a loud bang. It was a big hole in the wall and flew out.</p>
<p>Between his figures, he could see the faint blue light shining on his back. However, the Yin spirit of the first one just now completely avoided his ears and eyes and hit him hard.</p>
<p>Through the crack of the coffin, he was shocked to see the mysterious change of the witch&rsquo;s body. The above official policies are so old that they are still plotting.</p>
<p>In the dark, the mysterious fat man had some admiration in his eyes. Suddenly, he said, &ldquo;how could you sacrifice the ghost such as the Yin Yin Yin and then control Huang Kong. This practice is rare! &quot;</p>
<p>When the Lich heard the man speak for the first time, he was surprised, but his voice and eyes seemed to be invincible for the time being. At the same time, his own heart was agitated and he gave a bitter smile. He shook his head and said, &ldquo;you are wrong. &quot;</p>
<p>The fat man was a little surprised. He asked, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s wrong with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Lich sighed and said, &ldquo;I set up these evil spirits array in front of me, but the last one is controlled by other masters, which has nothing to do with me. &ldquo;He hated and said,&rdquo; if I really had such practices, I would not be trapped here. &quot;</p>
<p>The fat man frowned and stopped talking.</p>
<p>The Lich took a look at him, but within a few words, he had probably noticed the situation of the fat man. He seemed to be in the same situation as him, and was trapped in this strange coffin. But different from the lich, the fat man obviously had a more powerful and strange rammer, which imprisoned his whole body.</p>
<p>The Lich&rsquo;s heart could not help but be surprised. The confinement arranged on the coffin where he was now was so powerful that he could not move even though his practice was so high. However, it seemed that some people were not enough for this fat man, and they still had to put some frightening strange magic techniques on his body to trap him.</p>
<p>Then, if there is no ban on this fat man, will his conduct be frightening?</p>
<p>And think deeper, can control this fat man, what kind of horrible person?</p>
<p>The Lich&rsquo;s mind was in a mess. The Middle Earth, the generation of Hidden Dragon and crouching tiger, was far beyond his expectation.</p>
<p>Just at this moment, shangguance&rsquo;s roar came from the outside of the hut: &ldquo;who is still here? Please show up and see each other. What kind of hero are you? &quot;</p>
<p>In the hut, the Lich and the fat man looked at each other. Obviously, shangguance was also in a daze. At one glance, he saw through that the plot to hurt him was not a lich, but someone else.</p>
<p>At this time, only a silver bell like pleasant voice came down from the roof of this gloomy ghost. It was scornful and pleasant. He said, &ldquo;you said that you are playing tricks. I want you to see who is playing tricks on them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Lich saw that the mysterious fat man was trapped in the coffin, so he couldn&rsquo;t see who the woman was on the roof.</p>
<p>Shangguance stood at the end of the court. He was forced to endure the pain and looked up. Suddenly he took a cold breath and said in a cold voice, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman&rsquo;s voice said with a smile, &ldquo;not me, or who? Ha ha ha &quot;</p>
