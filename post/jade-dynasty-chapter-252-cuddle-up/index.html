      <p>A white shadow flashed across the sky and fell down on a small hill tens of miles away from Huqi mountain. The light light flickered for a moment and then dispersed to reveal the figure of nine tail Tianhu Xiaobai.</p>
<p>She gently held the body in her hands and put it on the ground. Then she checked it carefully to make sure that he was not seriously injured. Then she took a breath and stood up slowly.</p>
<p>On her white clothes, there are many marks of being burnt, showing the color of withered yellow or even burnt black. In the most severe places, a few holes have been burned by the blazing flame just now, and her white skin can be seen faintly.</p>
<p>But Xiaobai didn&rsquo;t pay attention to her condition at all. After calming down, she turned to stand up and looked at the direction of her future.</p>
<p>In the distant sky, a huge flaming pillar left indelible traces from the air. Even though it was so far away, Xiaobai could still feel the burning heat from the mountain breeze. However, on the ruins of Huqi mountain, in the calm lava flow in the sky, the strange red light and shadow were more and more prosperous, dancing wildly in the air In the deep, faint like a blood red figure, in desperate to laugh.</p>
<p>Xiaobai looked at it silently for a long time. The expression on her face could not be said to have any hatred and sadness. In other words, she just looked at everything that was like the end of the world in the eyes of ordinary people! Behind him, a burst of soft chattering sound suddenly sounded. Xiaobai turned around and suddenly was stunned. He could see that the ghost was still lying on the ground. However, his chest and clothes were moved a few times. Then a gray figure was afraid to come out, but it was monkey Xiaohui.</p>
<p>Xiaobai looked at him with disbelief, then he began to smile, clapped his hands, opened his arms, and said with a smile: &ldquo;little guy, I didn&rsquo;t expect that you are very clever. Come here quickly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Small ash squatted in the fierce chest and looked at the master. Grabbing his head, his three eyes rolled around and looked around him. Then he called twice and jumped over. Jump into Xiaobai&rsquo;s hands. A gentle smile appeared on the little white face. He held the little ash in his arms and gently touched his head and fur. Then he found that there were many wounds on the monkey&rsquo;s body, some of which looked like skin and flesh. It&rsquo;s a serious injury.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas&hellip;&rdquo; Xiaobai sighed slightly, shook his head, took Xiaohui to the side of the ghost, found a tree root to sit down, put Xiaohui on the ground in front of him, reached into his arms, took out a small jade bottle, and said, &ldquo;Xiaohui, you have suffered a lot with this unfortunate fellow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Hui&rsquo;s three eyes blinked at the same time. Then he shook his head again and again, like a rattle drum. At the same time, he screamed in his mouth. He was angry and angry. It seemed that he didn&rsquo;t like Xiaobai&rsquo;s vicious remarks. Little white this gray haired monkey one eye, not good Spirit said: &ldquo;yes, yes, I know, on your master the best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Hui grinned and touched his head. It looks quite happy.</p>
<p>Xiaobai held out his hand and picked up the monkey again. At the same time, he poured out several small green pills from the jade bottle, crushed them with his hands and turned them into fine green powder. And then carefully sprinkle the powder one by one on the small ash, those bloody wounds. The powder of these pills melts as soon as the flesh is seen. However, it melts into the small gray skin and fades out the subtle sound. In the twinkling of an eye, most of the wounds of Xiaohui have stopped bleeding and improved. It is obvious that the external injuries are quite miraculous.</p>
<p>Xiaobai waited for a moment, waiting for the powder to disappear in the wound. Pondered for a while, then stretched out his hand to tear off several pieces of white cloth from his white clothes, and carefully wrapped up the wound on Xiaohui&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p>This process of small ash has been very quiet, motionless let Xiaobai start, probably also understand Xiaobai is good intention!</p>
<p>Soon, Xiaobai has wrapped up the wound on Xiaohui&rsquo;s body. At a glance, Xiao Hui&rsquo;s chest, right arm, left leg and the back of his head were all tied with white cloth belts. It looked like a wounded soldier with serious injuries, but it was a bit funny.</p>
<p>Xiao Hui seems to be a little bit not used to it. She keeps looking at her body and her arms are ready to move. She has the meaning to see her bandaged wounds.</p>
<p>Xiaobai glared at it and said angrily, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t move!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohui was scared, jumped back a step, and then grinned. Sure enough, he didn&rsquo;t move again.</p>
<p>At this time, lying on one side of the body suddenly moved, the mouth issued a low * * Cheng, Xiaobai and Xiaohui at the same time looked at the past, a moment later, Xiaobai gently sighed.</p>
<p>The man was obviously still in a daze, but the name was still in his mouth——</p>
<p>Biyao</p>
<p>Xiaobai stood up and walked out slowly to the open area. Looking at the direction of Huqi mountain, Xiaohui grabbed his head and followed him. He grabbed Xiaobai&rsquo;s clothes and climbed up. He sat down on Xiaobai&rsquo;s shoulder as usual.</p>
<p>A faint sadness flashed in Xiaobai&rsquo;s eyes, and he gently stroked Xiaohui. In front of them, the Huqi mountain had disappeared from the world forever. There was only a terrible huge abyss, hot magma flowing from the abyss, and the red blood in the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Xiao Hui, what can I do?&rdquo; Xiaobai said softly. Although she was facing Xiaohui, she looked more like asking herself. She locked her eyebrows, as if she had pity and sorrow that could not be solved. &ldquo;Biyao is gone. I&rsquo;m really afraid of him I can&rsquo;t live. &quot;</p>
<p>Xiaohui didn&rsquo;t speak, but looked at Xiaobai with three eyes turning slightly. She didn&rsquo;t understand the meaning of Xiaobai, but Xiaobai had a slight smile. She turned around and looked at the man who was still breathing gently, but seemed to have lost his vitality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall we do? When I look at him like this, I feel terrible&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>Xiaohui suddenly &ldquo;squeaked&rdquo; and called. Xiaobai listened to it for a while. Then he gave a bitter smile and shook his head. He took Xiaohui down from his shoulder and held it in his arms. In a soft voice, he said, &ldquo;go home? It sounds good, but&hellip; &quot; She looked at the ghost sharp one eye, shook head, soft voice to small ash way: &ldquo;does he have a home?&rdquo; When he said this, I don&rsquo;t know why, but Xiaobai felt a pain in his heart. He turned his head and looked at his fierce face. He didn&rsquo;t know when to start. It turned out that this man&rsquo;s sideburns. I have white hair.</p>
<p>Some people say that the vicissitudes of life can be thousands of years, but there are also vicissitudes in the twinkling of an eye, just this human life. Who made it clear?</p>
<p>Xiaobai is a little dazed and can&rsquo;t help falling into the light thoughts. After a while, she is awakened by the voice of Xiao Hui&rsquo;s movements. She shook her head and gave a wry smile. This time, but for their own, how many years, but still so sentimental.</p>
<p>Then, she turned her head and looked at Xiaohui. The grey haired monkey jumped out of her arms and stood on the ground, pointing to the north from time to time. She kept on screaming.</p>
<p>Xiaobai looked at it for a long time, and her eyebrows began to wrinkle. After a long time, she suddenly said, &ldquo;you mean, we go to his earliest home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Hui nodded repeatedly.</p>
<p>Xiaobai looked at GUI Li, and saw that he was still dead. After a moment of silence, he sighed and said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the only way. Let&rsquo;s go. Anyway, it&rsquo;s better than staying here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Hui grinned. Xiaobai reaches out his hand, Xiaohui jumps up, almost climbs onto Xiaobai&rsquo;s shoulder and sits down. Xiaobai then goes to the ghost. He squatted down in front of him, looked at him silently for a while, and said softly, &ldquo;OK, let&rsquo;s go home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A white light, from this small hill Huoran bright, rushed to the sky. With a bit of determination with the terrible scenery behind him, he flew to the north without looking back.</p>
<p>Mountain wind, blowing from the earth, there is still a bit of blazing in the middle, like a gentle hand, gently soothing the injured land. In the distance, the huge wound that once was huqishan is still shrouded in red shadow. Facing all things in the world, they are shaking, like demonstrations and laughing.</p>
<p>Central Plains, Qingyun Mountain.</p>
<p>At the foot of Qingyun Mountain, there is still a scene of all things growing and flourishing. There are green grass and luxuriant trees everywhere. From the depths of trees, there is a pleasant song of birds. Although there is not the spirit of fairyland on the seven peaks of Qingyun Mountain, it is more warm.</p>
<p>In a thick overknee weeds, dilapidated ruins stand there quietly, here used to be a small village called &ldquo;Caomiao village&rdquo;, but now it has already changed. The breeze blows, the grass does not move, with a bit of grass fragrance.</p>
<p>The white light slowly fell down from the sky. Before Xiaobai could stand still, Xiaohui could not wait to jump off her shoulder and beat several rolls from the grass. She was very excited and happy. Small white mouth shows a trace of smile, and then carefully hold the ghost, leaning against a remnant wall to sit down.</p>
<p>At this time, the fierce, has awakened from the coma, but from the side to see, his appearance seems to be worse than before.</p>
<p>His face was so pale that he could hardly see blood. Although his eyes were open, they were empty and empty, without any expression, neither turning nor blinking. His whole body was full of lifelessness, which looked like dead bodies, more like living people.</p>
<p>Looking at GUI Li&rsquo;s appearance, Xiao Bai&rsquo;s face was a little anxious. In fact, on the way back to Caomiao village a few days ago, GUI Li had already woken up from a coma. However, from the moment he woke up, he had been like this all the time and had never changed it. No matter Xiaobai tried all kinds of methods and tried his best to persuade him, it was still useless.</p>
<p>Sometimes, Xiaobai even suspects that his numerous gentle and intimate advice has not been heard by the ghost.</p>
<p>Although she knows something about it, Xiaobai still doesn&rsquo;t think that Biyao&rsquo;s departure will cause such harm to Gui Li. Even though she is a Nine Tailed Tianhu and has been practicing Taoism for thousands of years, what can she do about the human feelings?</p>
<p>Next to him, Xiao Hui jumped into the woods in the distance. After a while, he threw it back carelessly. Holding a lot of wild fruits in his hand, he ran to Gui Li and Xiao Bai and handed them to them. It seems to be quite familiar with the situation around here.</p>
<p>Xiaobai looked at the grey haired monkey and sighed. Xiaohui took a wild fruit in his hand and gave it a slightly bitter smile. He said, &ldquo;Xiaohui, you are the best. You are so happy all day long. If your master is the same as you, then&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Hui grinned at Xiaobai and held the wild fruit in front of GUI Li. However, GUI Li was still motionless. After waiting for a while, Xiao Hui seemed to know that Gui Li couldn&rsquo;t eat. He shrugged his shoulders and put the wild fruit on the ground. Then he grabbed a fruit and sat down next to him. Open your mouth and chew.</p>
<p>It was in the afternoon that two people and a monkey sat quietly in the ruins of this dilapidated village. Xiaobai did not speak any more. As for Xiao Hui, after eating a lot of wild fruits, he put his head on his thigh. Spread out and fell asleep. Time, in the inadvertent quietly flow away, the sky scenery changes constantly, the blue sky, white clouds floating, one after another, the human breeze has eaten, the grass makes a sound, blowing the skirt hair, with a bit lazy.</p>
<p>The sun goes to the West. It was getting dark.</p>
<p>Night came, a bright moon just came out, still hanging in the Far East sky, there are several stars in the sky have begun to blink, watching this world another night.</p>
<p>Small ash mouth issued a few low grunts, turned over, continue to breathe big sleep, sleep, its face seems to be with a smile, I do not know if it is always easy to forget the worry and sadness. Only remember happy things?</p>
<p>Under the light moonlight, Xiaobai stood up quietly. She looked up at the moonlight in the sky, as if thinking about something. After a long time, she looked back to see that still motionless, has been integrated into the dark figure.</p>
<p>She sighed softly and walked towards the distance. The night wind was blowing and her white clothes were dancing with the wind. Walking alone under the moon, the plump and beautiful posture, like the ancient beautiful figure, floated away.</p>
<p>Night, the moon is particularly bright</p>
<p>In xiaozhufeng, Qingyun Mountain, Lu Xueqi is sitting alone in front of the window. Her white clothes are like snow and her brightness is like frost, reflecting her beautiful face. Moonlight, from the sky, fell on her at the window, like waves.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t tell how many nights there are. She used to sit quietly in the window and stare at the stars and the moon in the night sky.</p>
<p>Clear light shines on the lonely shadow, should pity the moonlight cold.</p>
<p>In the distance, there were bursts of bamboo waves, which was the mountain wind blowing through the bamboo forest on the Xiaozhu peak. Under the moonlight, the thin wind also blew here, quietly blowing into the window, taking a small corner of her clothes. Tianya, quietly leaning on the side of the window, like its beautiful master, bathed in the cold moonlight, staring at the sky.</p>
<p>Moon, slowly moved to the sky, Lu Xueqi silently looking, between the eyebrows, gently locked a touch of Acacia sadness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you ok?&rdquo; Almost can&rsquo;t hear whispers, gently read in her mouth, the gentle moonlight, but there is no ripple, still quietly sprinkled.</p>
<p>The lovesickness on her beautiful face seems to have become stronger.</p>
<p>Suddenly, at this moment, it seemed that she suddenly felt something. Lu Xueqi frowned. She was leaning on her body and slowly sat up. The light in her eyes twinkled. She took it back from the sky and looked out of the room.</p>
<p>Outside the hut, not far away is a small bamboo grove. In the moonlight, the slender bamboo casts slender shadows on the ground, but at the moment, there is a faint figure on those shadows.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s face changed slightly. She stood up and said coldly, &ldquo;where are you? Please show up and meet me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The shadow of the bamboo is whirling. It seems that the figure in the dark seems to have no weight. Standing on the branches of the thin bamboo branches, after a long time, a sigh suddenly comes out, and then someone says in a quiet way: &ldquo;I really feel pity for you. No matter when I see you, it&rsquo;s always so amazing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s eyes turned cold and looked at the dark shadow of the bamboo grove. But somehow, the voice of the visitors in the late night was soft and pleasant. It seemed that she had heard it somewhere. Thinking so in the mind, the surface is still as cold as frost, Lu Xueqi said: &ldquo;which one?&rdquo; If you like this book, please vote for me in Liancheng book.</p>
<p>A gust of mountain wind blows, and the bamboo shadow shakes suddenly, which disturbs the shadow on the ground. A white figure similar to Lu Xueqi floats out, which is Xiaobai.</p>
<p>Under the moonlight, I can see her beautiful features, her skin is crystal clear, and her subtle charm is just like a faint glimmer between her eyebrows, and her color is not inferior to that of Lu Xueqi.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi was stunned for a moment. She didn&rsquo;t expect that it would be Xiaobai&rsquo;s late night arrival. She was shocked and said, &ldquo;how could it be you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Small white light smile, way: &ldquo;nature is me, how, can&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi was silent for a moment and said, &ldquo;are you looking for me? What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaobai looked at her and said with a smile, &ldquo;at such a late night, you don&rsquo;t go to sleep, but you don&rsquo;t know who you are thinking about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s face suddenly turned a little red, and then she snorted. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to worry about it. What are you doing here? This is the boundary of xiaozhufeng in Qingyun gate. If you don&rsquo;t make it clear, don&rsquo;t blame me for being rude. &quot;</p>
<p>Xiaobai said leisurely, &ldquo;Oh. Seriously, I&rsquo;ll say it. In fact, who do you think in your heart is for whom I come. &quot;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s body slightly shakes and looks up to Xiaobai. Although she had a smile on her face, she didn&rsquo;t have the look of delirium. After hesitating for a moment, Lu Xueqi said slowly, &ldquo;he What&rsquo;s the matter with him? &quot;</p>
<p>Xiaobai said: &ldquo;he is now in the ruins of Caomiao village at the foot of Qingyun Mountain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s body trembled, and a trace of excitement swept over her face. Even the jade hand holding the window sill was tightly held. Only a moment later, her face was suddenly covered with a faint gloom and said in a low voice, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaobai was stunned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; he said</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi was silent for a moment, then slowly lowered her head and said, &ldquo;our school is in chaos now. The masters are worried about it, not to mention his current identity If I go to see him, I will break the rules and break the commandments. What&rsquo;s the use of meeting him&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>At this point, she seemed to be in a mood of agitation, and she bit her lower lip gently. Take a deep breath, as if to stabilize their emotions, who knows after a moment of silence, deep heart is suddenly general passion surging open. Filled with the whole body, his heart was hot, but he could no longer control himself. He blurted out and asked Xiaobai, &ldquo;is he, he OK?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaobai didn&rsquo;t speak, just looked at her silently.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Lu Xueqi felt uneasy, like a shudder. Flashed over her.</p>
<p>She stares at Xiaobai and holds her breath.</p>
<p>Xiaobai was silent for a long time. Then, she said quietly, &ldquo;Biyao is gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi seemed to have been struck by lightning. She stood in the same place, half open her mouth, but could not say a word. Her mind was buzzing and blank.</p>
<p>Xiaobai said faintly: &ldquo;your relationship with him is not an outsider. He is now&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is he, how is he now?&rdquo; Lu Xueqi seemed to wake up suddenly. She was pale and asked repeatedly, as if she could no longer stand still.</p>
<p>Xiaobai was silent for a moment and said, &ldquo;he is very bad now. I have no way to find you.&rdquo; Lu Xueqi show eyebrows lock, deeply worried are written on the surface, she has always been calm as ice, but now is a square inch chaos. She panted gently, like a heavy burden suddenly pressed on her heart, suddenly, she suddenly raised her head, staring at Xiaobai.</p>
<p>Xiaobai didn&rsquo;t say anything more, just nodded gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoa&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The window in front of Lu Xueqi was split and scattered. The beautiful white figure grabbed Tianya, flew out and rose into the sky.</p>
<p>What rules, what commandments?</p>
<p>Her eyes only crystal tears and can no longer suppress full of Acacia!</p>
<p>Rise to the sky and go away!</p>
<p>The wind blows on the surface like a knife, but it can&rsquo;t blow out the flame which has been suppressed for a long time, but it is finally burning tonight.</p>
<p>What happened to him? Biyao left, that is what kind of injury, ten years, but it seems that only she can deeply understand that man!</p>
<p>She went against the wind, determined and crazy, without looking back.</p>
<p>In the distant dark of the night, whether the darkness is covering him, that terrible cold is eroding him?</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s going to fly, to his side.</p>
<p>With him!</p>
<p>In the moonlight, there is still a shadow. Xiaobai slowly walked to the broken window, looked at it for a long time, and then slowly looked up, the sky&rsquo;s Moonlight fell silent, shining on her body.</p>
<p>She closed her eyes, slowly, slowly, a long breath, showing a smile.</p>
<p>Light, with a bit of bitterness, but also a little happy smile</p>
<p>The moon is high, the night is cold and the stars are rare.</p>
<p>The night wind blows with a trace of cold from the distance. The weeds in the ruins of Caomiao village fluctuate in the moonlight, surging like waves in the sea. There was no sound in the open night, only from unknown places around, deep in the weeds, came the low sound of insects from time to time.</p>
<p>In the dark corner, GUI Li still kept the original position, sitting still against the broken wall. Xiao Hui fell asleep on his legs. The night wind blew, it seemed to feel a little cold. He murmured, turned around, curled up, even his tail was clamped, and then continued to sleep sweetly.</p>
<p>Suddenly, in the bright moonlight, a white shadow quickly fell from the sky. Her speed is so fast that when she rushes down to the ground, the weeds around her suddenly fall out with the white shadow as the center. It took a long time to recover.</p>
<p>The white light dispersed, revealing Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s anxious face. She swept through the ruins and saw debris everywhere. There was no change from the last time she came here, except for some open spaces under the moonlight, most of the places were covered with darkness.</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t see a figure.</p>
<p>Standing in the same place for a moment, she slowly walked forward and walked into the ruins that had hidden so many memories.</p>
<p>Behind the ruins of every place, under the walls, there may be a period of past, there were so many family laughter, sadness, was buried under the broken debris. But now, under the cold moon breeze, only left desolate.</p>
<p>In Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s hands, Tianya flickers with light, as if knowing her master&rsquo;s complicated mind. White figure, walking through the ruins.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, Lu Xueqi stepped down, but suddenly a small but sharp cry came out from the grass under her feet, in this cold night. It&rsquo;s very sad.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s face turned white and her body became stiff for a moment. After a while, it was a vole that came out of the grass beside her feet. Four feet gallop, in a flash into another pile of dense grass.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi was stunned for half a moment and slowly gave out a breath. At the moment, her spirit has been tense to the extreme, and she will not care about things in ordinary days. It can make her heart tremble at the moment. However, this sudden scream, although a little scared Lu Xueqi, but also awakened the sleeping monkey on the other side.</p>
<p>Before he wakes up, the grey monkey&rsquo;s ears turn on their own. After a while, Xiaohui&rsquo;s three eyes are open.</p>
<p>The sound of footsteps came from the other side of the ruins.</p>
<p>Xiaohui gets up and looks around, but then he finds that Xiaobai&rsquo;s familiar figure is not there. The monkey is a little alert and stands for a while. After looking at the ghost, he sees that the master is still indifferent and apathetic. Then, Xiao Hui turned around and climbed up the broken wall, and looked at the direction of the sound of footsteps.</p>
<p>In the dark, the golden eyes on his forehead lit up slowly.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi walked for a while. Although it didn&rsquo;t take long, in her heart, she felt a long time like a thousand years. There was an empty darkness everywhere. Her heart was full of anxiety. At the moment, there was a little more fear. It was not in this period of Xiaobai&rsquo;s departure that he had done something stupid by himself. Her face turned pale again in an instant, and her steps could not help but quicken. It seemed that she saw the anxiety that was about to break out in her heart. After she took two steps again, Lu Xueqi suddenly stopped.</p>
<p>In front of a broken wall, suddenly lit up a bit of golden light, but it is not a night of fluorescence, it is an eye, closely watching her.</p>
<p>The moonlight moved forward slightly, lighting up the shadow. A grey haired monkey with three eyes lit up and squatted on the broken wall. It was strange and funny to see Lu Xueqi with several pieces of cloth tied like bandages.</p>
<p>Ash! Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s heart suddenly beat violently, almost without any thought. She swept the past, the white figure in the moonlight across a faint shadow, like the last Yanghua disappeared in spring.</p>
<p>Xiao Hui looks at Lu Xueqi, grabs her head and seems to be hesitant.</p>
<p>Among the women who have a relationship with their master, Lu Xueqi and Xiaohui are the most unfamiliar. Other women, such as Xiaobai or Xiaohuan, smile when they see each other, holding the monkey in their arms, touching or joking. Only the woman in white in front of her is as cold as ice and has never communicated with Xiao Hui.</p>
<p>But even so, Xiao Hui also knows clearly that the relationship between the woman and the master is extraordinary. Looking at the white shadow, Xiao Hui hesitates for a moment, but nothing happens.</p>
<p>Little ash didn&rsquo;t respond, but Lu Xueqi did. Her face anxiously grabbed the monkey. In the moonlight, except for the shadow of the monkey, there was also the shadow of the man. Her voice trembled and said, &ldquo;he Where has he gone</p>
<p>Xiaohui was held in the air by Lu Xueqi. Although her hands were both white and beautiful, the owner of the hand could not pay attention to any politeness at the moment, and his unconscious strength was growing. Xiaohui was a little angry and waved his hands and feet and squeaked. Before the monkey could express his protest, Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s eyes had floated from him. Behind the broken wall, there was deep darkness In the shadow, a shadow is quietly sitting there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pa!&rdquo; The protesting monkey suddenly lost its support and fell to the ground from mid air. It seemed that it had rubbed against a wound. It suddenly bared its teeth and jumped up, making a fierce grimace at Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s back.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi slowly turned the broken wall and walked to the ghostly side. What appeared in front of her was a body that seemed to have lost its life. A pair of empty and inanimate eyes were blankly open. She did not know which unknown place to stare at. Her whole face was full of haggard color, and even a faint decadent breath came from her body. People almost mistook it as a corpse It starts to rot from the inside of the body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dang!&rdquo; Tianya sword fell from her hands and fell gently on the ground. Lu Xueqi didn&rsquo;t even take a look at it. Slowly, she squatted down in front of the ghost, two lines of crystal clear tears, from her white cheek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Xiao Fan&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The body suddenly moved, like this familiar cry, vaguely touched somewhere in his heart. Only a moment later, he returned to his original state of bewilderment, like a tired bird, preferring to huddle in his little invisible nest, rather than look at the outside world any more.</p>
<p>Trembling slightly, Lu Xueqi stretched out her hands and slowly picked up his face. The familiar outline was engraved in her heart among the countless people she missed at night. Her lips trembled gently, choking, and whispered, &ldquo;Xiao Fan, I&rsquo;m here, it&rsquo;s me, I&rsquo;m Xueqi&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was motionless and his face was numb.</p>
<p>Cold night wind, Xi Xi blowing, the grass issued a wordy voice, gray haired monkeys squat on one side, looking at them without saying a word. In the cold moonlight, who cares about the men and women who are struggling in the world&rsquo;s humble corner?</p>
<p>Tick, transparent tears, from the cheek, but fell on the face of the ghost, wet with a touch of warmth. Lu Qi is sitting beside her in a cold place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid. Don&rsquo;t be afraid&hellip;&rdquo; Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s face, in the tears behind, slowly emerged with a bit of resolute courage, she gently put the fierce face in her arms, with the warmth of her chest to warm the body that was about to lose hope and collapse.</p>
<p>She tightly hugged the man in her arms and refused to let go. She slowly looked up at the sky. The moon was bright and bright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Xiao Fan, don&rsquo;t be afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be ok&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything will be OK!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She said in a soft but firm voice.</p>
<p>Moonlight, such as water, sprinkle to the human world, will pair of figures nestling in each other, light up gently. (to be continued. )</p>
