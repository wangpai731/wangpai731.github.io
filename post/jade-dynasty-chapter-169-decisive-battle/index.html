      <p>It seems to be a little embarrassed to see the evil spirits and monsters who have been severely damaged. Half of them are gray, while the other parts are blackened. They look strange and even funny. But in the laughter of those righteous disciples in the distance, the huge and terrifying monster slowly raised its head and suddenly let out a roar. The huge head opened its mouth, and a black air gushed out from it like a whirlwind, and rushed to the three in the air.</p>
<p>The Taoist immortal and others naturally did not practice the Tao. Their bodies were several feet high. At the same time, their bodies were bright with blue, gold and red. However, Rao is so, that black gas is actually coagulated but not dispersed in the sea of clouds and strong wind. After a long distance, you can still smell a strange smell, which is obviously extremely poisonous.</p>
<p>At the same time, standing on the head of a huge monster, the beast God waved his hands without expression. His posture was strange and his movements were simple, as if they were the actions of those ancient ancestors when they worshipped heaven before civilization. With his action, it seems that there is a strange force in the invisible, rolling, black clouds in the sky once again gathered, thick as ink, between the wind and cloud, there are lightning and strange lights moving, lighting up a bit in the layer of darkness.</p>
<p>The people on the ground were frightened for a moment, and they didn&rsquo;t know what kind of magic they were using. However, since the appearance of the beast God, all the weird witchcraft they had performed were huge and shocking, and they were all afraid in their hearts.</p>
<p>In the middle of the air, daoxuan real man frowned and suddenly waved his hand, ordering all the elders to retreat.</p>
<p>At last, some people found something wrong and screamed. Then, in the eyes of all the people, the black clouds were stacked and falling lower and lower. Finally, from the height of nine days, they fell down to the mortal world. On this sea of clouds, they swallowed up the bodies of the God of the beast and the huge evil spirit.</p>
<p>The range of black clouds hanging down to the ground looks like a few tens of square meters. In the right way, people retreat one after another, and many of the monsters that stay on the sea of clouds are shrouded in them. The three of daoxuan real people fell down on the cloud and stopped in the sky ten Zhang away from the black cloud, with a dignified face. Keep an eye on the rolling black clouds.</p>
<p>Above the sea of clouds square, at the moment, again fell into a strange silence, but this silence can not be maintained for too long. The black cloud rolled faster and faster, even for those standing in the distance. At the moment, I also feel the surging Demon power.</p>
<p>Finally, the huge black gas, facing the direction of daoxuan immortal, slowly opened a small mouth.</p>
<p>There is no light, as if it is eternal darkness, that dark hole cold face to the front, the surrounding clouds suddenly began to rotate madly, toward this small hole swirling. And this small hole endlessly swallows up all the black gas that comes, and slowly begins to expand, from an inch to a foot. From a foot to a foot, in a short period of time, a most terrifying beast&rsquo;s ferocious face appeared in front of the three righteous leaders.</p>
<p>In the deepest darkness, there was a roar of arrogance and desolation!</p>
<p>In an instant, all the black clouds shook and danced together, and the whole huge sky peak was shaken by it. That terrible figure had turned into blood all over the body, and flew out of the deep dark cave like a giant beast roaring in the sky. Towards daoxuan immortal and others.</p>
<p>Everybody change color together!</p>
<p>Standing at the top of the wind and cloud, the beast God boy roared up to the sky, and his clothes shook wildly in the wind. The roar and fury of the huge evil spirit under his feet far surpassed him. It was as powerful as a mountain, and its momentum was incomparable in the world!</p>
<p>Just for a moment, in the eyes of the three masters of Taoism, daoxuan immortal, Pu Hong master and Yun Yilan. It has been seen that the evil spirit is bloody and ferocious, but the most important thing is that its Demon power is rising. The damage caused by the pure fire of Yun Yilan has been gone for a long time, but it has been worse than before. At the moment, the dark clouds dispersed, and we could see that behind these monsters, in the dark clouds, the bones of the monsters piled up like mountains were all like withered leaves, lying on the ground.</p>
<p>At the moment, the huge figure covered the whole sky with teeth and claws, and the shadow shrouded in the heads of the three masters. The real man daoxuan looked solemn and was about to move. Suddenly, master Pu Hong whispered to Buddha and said, &ldquo;two Taoist brothers, please step back a little bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having said that, master Puhong&rsquo;s figure drifted forward two steps, facing the huge and incomparable shadow in the sky. Looking from a distance, master Puhong was as small as a mole ant.</p>
<p>A golden light suddenly came out of his hand, shining like a little bright sunshine in the dark and angry world!</p>
<p>The monk&rsquo;s face was full of compassion. His hands were folded, but from the top of his palm, the golden light bloomed brightly. He grew up from a small age, and in an instant, he radiated thousands of golden lights and went straight into the sky.</p>
<p>In the golden light, a magic weapon with the shape of a disc and a golden wheel is slowly sacrificed. The whole body is golden with a square foot in diameter. The golden body image of Arhats is engraved around the edge. Around the middle is the Buddha&rsquo;s single palm and ten palms, which are merciful to all living beings.</p>
<p>In the distance, countless people almost at the same time, cry out!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great sorrow Golden Wheel&rdquo;&hellip;! &quot;</p>
<p>The golden light of this Buddhist treasure is even more brilliant. With the power of master Pu Hong, this golden light curtain is as good as that made by 100 disciples of the right path. In the golden light, all kinds of Buddhist truths appear and disappear from time to time. What is illuminated is the solemn and compassionate spirit, which is in sharp contrast to the evil spirit ahead.</p>
<p>However, in the face of this immortal Buddhist treasure, the evil spirit beast leaping out of the dark cloud with the intention of killing. Driven by the beast God, it still does not show any intention of shrinking back. It still falls from the sky and plunges into the golden light.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, when the huge shadow collided with the brilliant golden light, there was no sound, no earth shaking scene as expected. The golden light suddenly turned around and surrounded from all directions. The black air on the ground suddenly became smaller and narrowed gradually, but it still flew forward. Finally, the huge figure of the evil spirit was killed The pressure is only less than 12 / 10 of the original.</p>
<p>However, the still existing black air of flying shot was more and more black. With the faint roar and roar, the black arrow passed through the sky, broke through numerous golden barriers, and rushed to master Pu Hong.</p>
<p>He was cold-blooded and ferocious, as if in front of him. In the deepest darkness!</p>
<p>Master Puhong closed his eyes, and chanted the Buddhist mantra in his mouth. It was light and fast, like a song but not a song. Like language, not language. The wheel turned slowly in mid air, and the Golden Wheel of great sorrow, which emitted thousands of golden lights, fell from the top of the head and fell in front of Pu Hong, the Buddha&rsquo;s real body and the Dharma images of the Arhats. Together, we are faced with this fierce monster.</p>
<p>In the golden light, the faces of the Buddhists are like compassion, like killing, compassion is compassion for all things in the world, and killing is to subdue demons and kill ferociously. Who knows which side is the true face of Buddha?</p>
<p>Chanting low and low, growing up from childhood, instantly resounding through the world!</p>
<p>The brilliant golden light spurted out, which was hard to see. Like the Buddha flame burning all over the sky, swallowing all the black in front of him, he was born in the air and raised a huge golden light.</p>
<p>Such a spectacular scene is really rare in the world. All the people above the sea of clouds are shocked by the incomparable power of Buddhism.</p>
<p>However, at the moment when everyone was stunned, the strange black, which seemed to have been awed by the power of the Giant Buddha, suddenly flashed out from the golden light, in a brilliant. It&rsquo;s like a thin black needle, stabbing on the Golden Wheel of great sorrow.</p>
<p>On the golden wheel, the face of the original merciful Buddha suddenly flashed a black color. Almost at the same time, the solemn Sanskrit singing all over the sky suddenly stopped, and the noisy world suddenly became strangely still.</p>
<p>All people&rsquo;s eyes immediately gathered on the two figures in the golden light.</p>
<p>A trace of pain flashed on the face of master Pu Hong, and the black air seemed to be reborn. From the original filament shape, it quickly grows larger, and gradually forms, showing the figure of the beast God.</p>
<p>The black air gradually rises, and the righteous people change color together. From a distance, the beast God&rsquo;s face still has no expression, even the eyes are still indifferent. At this moment, on the golden wheel, the face of the Buddha statue began to appear strange black, more and more heavy, and the originally benevolent and peaceful God&rsquo;s appearance has become violent, more and more ferocious.</p>
<p>Master Puhong&rsquo;s face changed greatly. His face sank and he roared. His robe was full of wind and his body swelled in an instant. It seems to have been stimulated. The golden light suddenly turns around all over the sky and makes a sharp whistling sound. It quickly collapses into a golden light ball, which is the size of a palm. The golden awn moves like the sun in the sky. You can also feel the surge of Buddha power from afar.</p>
<p>In the sky, again sounded the solemn voice of Sanskrit singing.</p>
<p>The golden light ball flickered with brilliant brilliance, and slowly pushed forward. Under the urging of such solemn and solemn Buddhist magic power, the black color of the Buddha on the Golden Wheel of great sorrow gradually faded and began to return to normal. The beast God seemed to feel something, and his face changed slightly.</p>
<p>Seeing the golden ball finally touching the Golden Wheel of great sorrow, suddenly, the golden light was introverted, and the whole magic weapon Golden Wheel seemed to become transparent, like a ray of sunlight finally blooming, like a flowing Buddhist power, which was like a volcano that had been brewing for a long time, flashing countless golden lights and dazzling Buddha&rsquo;s true words.</p>
<p>In a flash, the whole sky became a golden ocean, and the golden awns came to the sky and the ground, and no other colors could be seen. In such a brilliant sea of light, it seems that no more demons can survive.</p>
<p>Except, the faint finger!</p>
<p>In the world engulfed by the boundless Buddha light, there is a wisp of black gas in the golden light, which is as fine as smoke and dust. It flies up and appears from time to time. It hovers before the Golden Wheel of great mercy, and gently touches the Buddha&rsquo;s face, between the eyebrows of his kind and compassionate face.</p>
<p>That point, such as a drop in the sea, such as mustard seed in Xumi, is insignificant compared with the light of Buddha in the sky. However, master Pu Hong&rsquo;s face changed, and the whole face became dull, as if dead gray.</p>
<p>Therefore, all the people saw the splendor. Suddenly, the heaven and earth were shaken, and the Buddhist light was turbulent. The monk who looked like a fairy, &ldquo;Wow,&rdquo; spewed out a big mouthful of blood and dyed the magic wheel in front of him.</p>
<p>The wind stopped quietly, the chaotic world was quiet, and the golden light dissipated in the swaying. Master Pu Hong&rsquo;s lips trembled slightly, and his body seemed to falter for a while, and then he retreated. FA Xiangren in the back had already rushed forward and held him.</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong gave a wry smile and said to the void in front of him: &ldquo;the benefactor&rsquo;s magic power is very strong. I&rsquo;m really the only one I&rsquo;ve ever seen in my life. I admire you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the Tongtian peak of Qingyun Mountain, countless righteous disciples were in a state of uproar.</p>
<p>In the middle of the sky, the golden light dissipates and the black gas is reborn. Such as jumping out of the void, with a sharp roar, the huge evil spirit beast suddenly reappeared. I really don&rsquo;t know such a huge body. Why can&rsquo;t we see its shadow in the fierce fighting just now, but now it&rsquo;s reborn like this?</p>
<p>And above its head, the startled figure who was in the right way of the world at this time was more and more pale. For the first time, the indifference on his face was a little tired, only his eyes were still indifferent as usual. However, when his eyes saw the figure of master Pu Hong, he still moved slightly and snorted coldly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The art of cultivating the truth in the Middle Earth is indeed extraordinary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong shook his head slightly. He had intended to speak and persuade him. However, judging from the appearance of the other party, he knew that it was useless to say so. Now, with the help of the Dharma equivalent, he retreated.</p>
<p>Among the three leaders of the right path. At this time, there were two people who had suffered losses under this mysterious and strange demon. For a while, everyone changed color at the top of Tongtian peak. And the beast demon there, is all the animals roar, the momentum is high.</p>
<p>It was at this time that a roar rose from behind. His highness Yuqing of Tongtian peak appeared a huge whirlpool in the cold ice pool. The water whirled rapidly, turning faster and faster. The roar, like the roar of a dragon or a tiger, became louder and louder. It even suppressed the sounds of countless monsters ahead.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s in the ice pool. The water column, like a rush, suddenly rises. It flies straight to the sky and rushes to the height of tens of Zhang. The water column is coagulated but not scattered, like a wild flower blooming. The giant body of the water kylin, a sacred beast in Zhenshan, Qingyun Mountain, appeared.</p>
<p>The Qingyun disciple on Tongtian peak was astonished at first, then he was ecstatic and cried out, and his spirit was greatly improved. Under the eyes of all the people, the water Qilin roared up to the sky, shook his head and wagged his tail. He flew away from the water column and fell to the clouds.</p>
<p>Just then the water column that rose from the sky suddenly fell down and roared like a mountain torrent, splashing the cold ice pool around. The righteous disciples who had no time to dodge hid everywhere. For a moment, they were quite embarrassed.</p>
<p>But most people, at the moment, where there are so many, all eyes are looking at the sky above. Shuiqilin&rsquo;s angry eyes were wide and roaring. He stood in the void in the air, and a dark green figure, slowly falling down, was on the water Qilin, facing the front. At the moment, he looked almost invincible.</p>
<p>Taoist immortal!</p>
<p>There was no change in the cold face of the beast God, and his eyes were confronted with daoxuan immortal. However, the huge evil spirits and monsters under his feet roared at the water unicorn in the same way. Obviously, the water kylin didn&rsquo;t like these monsters at all, and the appearance was even more fierce, with its fangs showing and roaring.</p>
<p>In the roar, the water Qilin raised his head fiercely, and the faint blue light flashed. He spat out a long sword which looked like stone and non stone from his mouth. Immortal daoxuan stretched out his right hand and caught it.</p>
<p>At that moment, all of a sudden, the whole Qingyun Mountain was still, and a moment later, the thundering cry burst out like the tide.</p>
<p>Zhuxian ancient sword!</p>
<p>In the legend, the invincible ancient sword for killing immortals and the supreme immortal tool for subduing demons and demons in the right way finally reappeared in the world ten years later.</p>
<p>A beam of light, from the legendary ancient sword, flowed quietly like gentle water, and reached immortal daoxuan. Among the numerous cheers and shouts of the crowd, immortal daoxuan&rsquo;s body just grasped the handle of the sword, but somehow his body trembled a little. Then, once again, he grasped the ancient sword of Zhuxian with force, composure and heavy force.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God&rsquo;s sword, kill evil spirits!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Daoxuan real man&rsquo;s face is as usual, and his expression is peaceful, but he holds Zhuxian in his hand and points to the animal God in front of him with his sword. He says so lightly. In the eyes of countless people, he is like an immortal that can&rsquo;t be blasphemed.</p>
<p>Zhuxian sword, countless people cheered for it. Before the immortal sword, the beast God looked at the ancient sword for a long time, and then carefully looked at the real man daoxuan. Suddenly, his indifferent face changed. He shook his head and laughed, and the laughter reverberated between the heaven and the earth. Occasionally, there were some low cough sounds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good sword, good sword!&rdquo; The beast God clapped his hands in admiration. However, in his tone, there was a sense of sarcasm. He said: &ldquo;such a fierce and supreme sword, even I am afraid of it. Unexpectedly, it appears in your hands. It is really Ha ha ha ha&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>He did not go on talking, but as if he saw the most ridiculous thing in his life, he couldn&rsquo;t stop laughing, making all the people puzzled.</p>
<p>Looking at the rampant figure, daoxuan&rsquo;s face remained unchanged, and he did not speak to argue. He just inhaled deeply. His eyes were slightly closed and then opened. His eyes were shining. In an instant, a dazzling light bloomed from the ancient sword of Zhuxian.</p>
<p>Water Unicorn roars up to the sky!</p>
<p>The animal God&rsquo;s laughter stopped suddenly, his face was dignified and faced the front.</p>
<p>And at the foot of all the people, hold their breath, everyone knows, the fight between these two people, is the final decisive battle.</p>
<p>The final result of this catastrophe will come! (to be continued. )</p>
