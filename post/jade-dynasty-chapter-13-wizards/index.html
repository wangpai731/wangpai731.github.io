      <p>&ldquo;Longshoufeng Cangsong real disciples Qi Hao and Lin Jingyu met with Uncle Tian and Uncle Su.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the Shoujing Hall, Tian is not easy to sit with Su Ru, and the rest of the disciples are beside him. Two white men in the field, namely Lin Jingyu and another handsome young man named Qi Hao, are facing Tian Tian not easy to salute. Zhang Xiaofan stood at the end of the disciple list and looked at Lin Jingyu in the field.</p>
<p>I haven’t seen you for years, and everyone has grown up.</p>
<p>At this moment, Lin Jingyu also turned his head to look at Zhang Xiaofan, the two eyes met, Lin Jingyu smiled slightly, Zhang Xiaofan warmed his heart, nodded with emotion.</p>
<p>Tian Yijian turned his eyes on Qi Hao, and then looked at Lin Jingyu, his face sinking. When he saw the two of them, Shen Shenjunlang, with his eyesight, for a moment, he already saw that the qualifications of the two were far away. Above his disciples. Needless to say, Qi Hao, among the younger generation of Qingyunmen, he was already well-known, but he was a young Lin Jingyu. From just now he could come to the sword to know that he had at least repaired to the fourth level above the Tai Chi Xuan Qing Dao It took him only three and a half years to get started, and this qualification is really amazing.</p>
<p>Thinking of this, Tian is not subconsciously looking at Zhang Xiaofan who is standing at the end. Compared with the two, Tian is not easy to be in a bad mood. He coldly said: &ldquo;What does your master let you do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Qi Hao Gong said: &ldquo;Uncle Master Tian, ​​the real teacher Cangsong is entrusted by the master Dao Xuanzhen, and he will take care of all the matters of the &ldquo;Seven Vessels will Wuwu&rdquo; trial after two years. Because there are a few changes, it is destiny I came to report with Brother Lin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Anhou snorted, looked up and down at Lin Jingyu, and said, &ldquo;He deliberately wanted to demonstrate to me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Qi Hao and Lin Jingyu both changed their faces. Lin Jingyu was about to attack at the time, but Qi Hao reached out to stop him and smiled: &ldquo;Uncle Tian is really kidding, we are both under the Qingyun Gate, and Uncle Tian is very respectable. , The teacher will never show any disrespect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian was not easy to look gloomy, and he did not see any improvement at all. Instead, Su Ru&rsquo;s smile around him was kind and gentle: &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to care. Uncle Tian is laughing with you. By the way, what did you say just now, what&rsquo;s going on? ?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Qi Hao respectfully said: &ldquo;Return to Uncle Su, this is the case. In the past years, &ldquo;the seven veins will marry martial arts&rdquo;, there were four people in each vein under the Qingyun Gate, and there were four more people in Changmentongtianfeng, a total of thirty-two. Count, draw the showdown, the winner advances, so in five rounds, the winner is the leader of the younger generation of Qingyunmen, who can be carefully cultivated by the teachers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru&rsquo;s mouth smiled, and she was very handsome, saying: &ldquo;Looking at the last big test, you were a big show, I remember you were the leader in the end. If it wasn&rsquo;t for Xiao Yicai from the long door, it might be you who won It’s the champion of Qingyun Gate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Qi Hao didn’t change his face and smiled: “Uncle Su is too much for the prize. In the last big test, the elder Xiao Xiaocai was the talented wizard of Brother Xiao. He was so talented and talented that I was far behind. Regarding the &ldquo;Seven Vessels Meeting Martial Arts&rdquo; this time two years later, after discussing with the head real person, the family teacher made some changes in the rules, and I was instructed to inform the two teachers and uncles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian is not easy to move with Su Ru at the same time, saying: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Qi Hao said: &ldquo;Teacher Cangsong really believes that the&rsquo;Seven Vessels&rsquo; Wuwu&rsquo; trial was intended to discover the materials that can be made among the disciples of each vein and cultivate them. Today, Qingyun Gate has nearly 1,000 disciples, including the younger generation. There are many new disciples, many of whom have outstanding talents. With this in mind, only once in sixty years, there are only four of them, which is too few. Therefore, the teacher suggested that each of the seven veins should have nine disciples. People, among which the number of longmen is the most, and one more person will become 64. On this basis, as always, the lottery will be drawn, and there will be six rounds to determine the winner. This will also avoid the regret of the relics of the sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian is not easy to look at Su Ru, his face is even more ugly. The number of his disciples in Dazhufeng is low, and his qualifications are poor. At first glance, he seems to have taken advantage of it, but in fact it is Changmentong Tianfeng and Cangsong Longshoufeng with the largest number of talents, which is greatly beneficial.</p>
<p>Su Ru saw her husband&rsquo;s face ugly and shook his head slightly to show it. Tian Yibiao didn&rsquo;t know the meaning of his wife. Since the matter was discussed by the head brother and Cangsong, it was a foregone conclusion, and the dispute was useless. Now the cold road said: &ldquo;So good, I have no opinion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Qi Hao smiled and said, &ldquo;This is the best. In addition, before the departure, the teacher had commanded me, that is, my brother Lin and the next Master Zhang in the seat of Master Tian are old friends. I also hope that Uncle Tian Let them both talk about the old.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian was not upset in his heart and waved his hand impatiently: &ldquo;Precise, accurate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu had been impatient for waiting for a long time, but it only prevented him from being a senior elder, so he didn&rsquo;t dare to attack. At this time, he heard it accurately and walked to Zhang Xiaofan at the first turn. Zhang Xiaofan was excited and came out.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu walked up to him and looked at him carefully. There was a sudden redness in his eyes, and he said abruptly: &ldquo;You grew up, Xiaofan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan had mixed feelings and nodded, saying, &ldquo;You too. By the way, do you have any news about the massacre in the village?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu shook his head: &ldquo;I have asked Master many times in recent years, but there has been no progress, how about you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan smiled bitterly: &ldquo;I am the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu took his hand and said, &ldquo;We talk outside and outside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan hesitated and turned to look at Tian Zhuan and Su Ru. Tian Zhuan ignored him, but Su Ru smiled and said, &ldquo;Go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was overjoyed, nodded to her, and hurried out with Lin Jingyu. Above the lobby, only Qi Hao was left as a guest. He was dressed in white and stood out, with no look at all. He looked at the disciples of Dazhufeng one by one, and finally his eyes fell on Song Daren. He smiled and said: &ldquo;This is Brother Song Daren and Song. We also did it in the last big test. Have met before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren quickly returned the salute, saying: &ldquo;Brother Qi is so memorable, I still remember my defeat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as this remark came out, the disciples moved, Tian Ling&rsquo;er stood beside his mother and asked quietly, &ldquo;Ma&rsquo;am, why was the big brother defeated in his hand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru nodded and lowered her voice: &ldquo;Yes. At that time, your brother and sister won two games in a row. My father and I were very happy. Unexpectedly, when we met this person in the third round, we lost in a few rounds. Now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Ling&rsquo;er put out his tongue and said, &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t he be so powerful?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru didn&rsquo;t answer her right away, but turned to look at her husband, but Tian couldn&rsquo;t look hard, sitting still, and shook his head, saying: &ldquo;Qi Hao&rsquo;s qualifications are indeed far better than your brother, that day There are no false tricks in the competition, especially the magic sword &ldquo;Heng Bing&rdquo; he cultivated is made of ice crystals from the Arctic, which is extremely powerful. Your brother is not comparable to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment, Tian Nan didn’t suddenly seem to feel something, but also turned his head and looked at Su Ru. The two of them met, and they both saw what was hidden deep in the other person’s heart but did not say it. Such a talent, how good it is!</p>
<p>Under the hall, Qi Haozheng was chatting with his disciples. He was successful in practice and trusted by his teachers. He walked all over the world. He was very knowledgeable, and he was clever and clever, and all of them were close to each other for a while. Even Song Daren, who had been defeated in his hands, had no hostility.</p>
<p>After a burst of laughter, Qi Hao didn&rsquo;t know what bad jokes, everyone laughed, and then Qi Hao&rsquo;s eyes inadvertently fell to Tian Ling&rsquo;er who had been standing behind Su Ru, and then saw her wrapped around her waist. The &ldquo;Amber Zhu Ling&rdquo;, with bright eyes, smiled and said: &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this girl the famous Tian Linger Tian Shimei?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Ling&rsquo;er raised his eyebrows and said, &ldquo;How can you know me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Qi Hao smiled slightly and walked a few steps, looking at her and said, &ldquo;Tian Shimei is sixteen years old, and his accomplishments on the sand of Taoist Xuanqing Dao are no different. This is a well-known thing. I have admired it for a long time. Seeing today, it really deserves its reputation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Linger&rsquo;s face was red, and he said, &ldquo;You never saw me do anything, how do you know that my name is well-deserved?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Qi Hao stayed for a while, then smiled and said: &ldquo;Sister Tian not only looks beautiful, but also has a keen mind, calling me ashamed of being a brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Ling&rsquo;er saw him standing in front of him with a handsome and tall figure, and listened to his mouth praised his beauty, and there was a sudden sweetness in his heart, but he still said lust: &ldquo;It will talk nonsense, like what brother, no harm! &quot;</p>
<p>Tian is not easy to frown, Su Ru already said: &ldquo;Ling&rsquo;er, no nonsense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Qi Hao quickly said to Su Ru: &ldquo;Uncle Su must never blame Shimei, because I didn&rsquo;t speak at all and offended her.&rdquo; Speaking of this, he groaned slightly and reached out a small box from his arms. , Handed it to Tian Ling&rsquo;er, and said with a smile: &ldquo;Tian Shimei, the&rsquo;Qingliang Pearl&rsquo; in this small box was my family teacher Cangsong, a real chivalrous man, and the killing of a demon murderer was accidental, although not What a rare treasure, but it can also remove the heat and lower the heat when worn on the body. In addition, it is said to have some benefits for women&rsquo;s beauty and skin care. I gave it to the sister today, and I am the one to pay the guilt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Linger&rsquo;s face was red again, and he hadn&rsquo;t spoken yet. Su Ru said: &ldquo;Master Qi&rsquo;s nephew, this cool bead is also a treasure. Ling&rsquo;er can&rsquo;t stand it, you should put it away quickly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Qi Hao smiled and said, &ldquo;Uncle Su has no idea. This cool bead is of no use to me. It&rsquo;s like chicken ribs. But Tian Tianmei is young and beautiful, and it just fits together. It is also a little careful for me. &quot;</p>
<p>Tian Ling&rsquo;er looked at Qi Hao, and his expression was already very calm. He reached for the small box and whispered: &ldquo;Thank you, Brother Qi.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Qi Hao seemed extremely happy, with a wide smile on his face, and said, &ldquo;No thanks, no thanks, your sister, you are talented and bright, and your future is boundless. Speaking of that there are many talents in Qingyunmen, but few of them can have the qualifications you have. Little, I’m willing to worship the wind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian was not easy to hear in his ears, and for the first time a smile appeared on his face, Tian Ling&rsquo;er said: &ldquo;Senior Brother has won the prize.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Qi Hao shook his head and said, &ldquo;Otherwise, I have been fervented up by the teacher since I was a child, but I am far worse than you in practice at your age. But&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Linger&rsquo;s young girl&rsquo;s heart is very fond of Qi Hao&rsquo;s praise, but after listening to him with a &ldquo;but&rdquo;, he couldn&rsquo;t help but ask: &ldquo;How about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this time, even Tian Tian and Su Ru also turned their heads, and wanted to hear what Qi Hao said in the mouth, but only listened to Qi Hao said: &ldquo;But if it is only on the qualifications, there are people who can rival Tian Shimei. &quot;</p>
<p>Tian Linger froze for a moment, and said, &ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Qi Hao pointed at the outside of the Jingjing Hall with a smile, and said, &ldquo;This is my younger brother Lin. Since he was taken home by his teacher Cangsong three years ago, he has entered the country amazingly in just a few years. It’s a talented talent, no one among the disciples in this lineage, has broken through the fourth floor of Yuqingjing in three years. I haven’t heard of such a person in thousands of years.” Speaking of this, Qi Hao is full of love, saying: “ The teacher praised Brother Lin very much, and he called it the Wizard of the Thousand Years, which is almost comparable to that of the Green Leaf Patriarch of that year!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crack!&rdquo; A crisp sound, everyone was shocked, turned to look at the sound, but Tian Tian was not easy to look blue, extremely ugly, hard sandalwood handrails on the hand, he was stiffened by him Cut it off.</p>
<p>Qi Hao froze for a moment and whispered to Su Ru: &ldquo;Uncle Su, did I say something wrong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ruqiang laughed and was about to speak. Suddenly he shouted outside the hall: &ldquo;Oops!&rdquo; The voice didn&rsquo;t fall. I saw a figure fell in from outside the hall and thumped on the ground. Rolled a few times, disgraced, extremely embarrassed. Everyone looked closely, not who is Zhang Xiaofan?</p>
<p>Everyone in Dazhufeng&rsquo;s face changed his face. Tian Ling&rsquo;er and Zhang Xiaofan were the best. When he rushed up, he helped him and asked anxiously, &ldquo;Xiaofan, what&rsquo;s wrong with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s fall was not light, and his head was a little dizzy, but he still said in his mouth: &ldquo;No, nothing, I&rsquo;m fine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment, Lin Jingyu also ran in from outside the door, anxious on his face, and said: &ldquo;Xiaofan, you are fine, I missed it for a while&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Ling&rsquo;er heard that this person bullied his younger brother and rushed upwards. In addition, Qi Hao praised Lin Jingyu just in front of him. There was still something he couldn&rsquo;t compare with him, and he felt uncomfortable. At the moment, I didn&rsquo;t even think about it. I stood up and said angrily: &ldquo;Why do you bully people?&rdquo; Said the tactics, and at the sight of the gleaming rays of light, Amber Zhu Ling had already sacrificed, and the sound of &ldquo;Shoot&rdquo; rushed to Lin Jingyu .</p>
<p>Su Ru and Qi Hao shouted at the same time: &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Amber Zhu Ling was as fast as lightning, and rushed to Lin Jingyu in a moment. Although Lin Jingyu was not disturbed, she just felt the colorful sight in front of her, and knew that it was a magic weapon of the Immortal Family. She immediately retreated three steps, her left finger was facing the sky, her right hand was facing the ground, she held the sword tactics, and shouted, &ldquo;Get up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wowing&rdquo; Long Yin, resounding in the guarding hall, I saw Lin Jingyu&rsquo;s whole body shrouded in blue light, and the brilliant blue fairy sword was sacrificed, the blade was clear like autumn water, and the spirit was steaming. Amber Zhu Ling&rsquo;s fierce Dao Daoguang came, and also reflected the face of everyone in the Shou Jing Tang into a blue color.</p>
<p>Tian Anhou snorted suddenly and said coldly: &ldquo;Cang Song is really willing to pass the &ldquo;Dragon Sword&rdquo; to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seeing that Lin Jingyu was not injured, Qi Hao felt relieved and smiled aside: &ldquo;The family teacher once said that the younger brothers are talented, and they will become great tools, so it is also necessary to focus on cultivation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian is not easy to look even more ugly.</p>
<p>At this time, the amber Zhu Ling and the Dragon Sword were holding each other, but seeing Tian Ling&rsquo;er&rsquo;s eyes wide open, his arms fluttered, the red clothes fluttered, and his body slowly rose to the air, crossing his chest with his left and right hands, making orchid fingers, Shouted: &ldquo;Bound God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The voice fell, and I saw Xiaguang grow long. The original three-foot-long amber Zhu Ling suddenly retreated and flew to Tian Ling&rsquo;er to stop. After a crisp sound, Xiaguang flourished, and the wind grew. , Fast and unmatched, in an instant I don’t know how many times it came out, filled the sky above the Shoujing Church, and immediately pressed the blue light of the Dragon Sword. After a while, it turned into a million ropes and rushed to Lin Jingyu, Wrap him in the middle, tightly closed.</p>
<p>Su Ru stood up and shouted into the air, &ldquo;Ling Er, don&rsquo;t let go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But only between her speeches, the red damask has surrounded Lin Jingyu tightly, not only did everyone not see Lin Jingyu, even the figure of Tian Ling&rsquo;er in the air was also layered by layer of red Aya was covered.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan only looked stunned, and he was so divine, he suddenly heard someone praise behind him: &ldquo;Amber Zhu Ling, deserve the real name!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned his head to look at it, but Qi Hao was looking at the field intently, citing something in his mouth, but no worries.</p>
<p>Seeing that Tian Linger&rsquo;s victory was settled, everyone suddenly heard a harsh &ldquo;hiss&rdquo;, and a gap suddenly appeared in the layers of red silk, revealing a little blue light.</p>
<p>Tian is not easy to change color with Su Ru at the same time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roar!&rdquo;, a loud noise, like the angry dragon screaming, sounded for nine days, the gap was magnified a hundred times in an instant, the blue light was back to prosperity, and the stern came out, Lin Jingyu&rsquo;s sword united, and the whole body appeared faintly The dragon shape, like the arrow from the string, rushed towards Tian Ling&rsquo;er unstoppably.</p>
<p>Everyone was eclipsed, but Tian Ling&rsquo;er was scared but not panicking. His hands were protecting his chest to make Taiji diagrams, and the void was drawn, and a few layers of red silk came back to him in a moment, turning into countless barriers. Just listening to the sound of fragmentation, Lin Jingyu cut the dragon sword and pierced the layers of red damask. Although the castration was a little slow, the momentum of the unprecedented one did not diminish slightly. Seeing that the two would have a life and death victory negative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zhe!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a chill, the dragon sword was defeated, and the shock came back. Lin Jingyu was shocked and looked up. I saw an ice wall formed between him and Tian Linger in a moment. The cold struck the people, and the dragon sword was amazingly powerful, but it could not pass this ice wall. Qi Hao didn&rsquo;t know when he had snatched him in front of him, and pulled him back a few feet away.</p>
<p>On the other side, Tian Ling&rsquo;er was pale, but Su Ru had already grabbed her in the blink of an eye and retreated to Tian Yi&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>The two Xianjia magic weapons on the field were out of control and gradually lost their light, and each flew back to the owner.</p>
<p>There was silence in the Shoujing Hall.</p>
