      <p>Qingyun Mountain, Tongtian peak.</p>
<p>In front of the magic moon cave, GUI Li, Lu Xueqi and Lin Jingyu stand opposite each other. The already delicate atmosphere suddenly seems to be stiff. All the attention of the three people instantly condenses on the ancient sword which is inserted upside down on the ground.</p>
<p>legend of chusen!</p>
<p>The legendary sword, which is famous all over the world, involves endless past events and determines the fate of many people. At this moment, it is so quietly inserted on the ground. It looks ordinary and insignificant, as if it has been integrated with the mountains and rivers.</p>
<p>However, the name on the blade is so dazzling and arrogant that it looks at the people around him with awe inspiring eyes, which makes the people around him unable to breathe smoothly.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how long it took to wake up from the incredible shock. The three people breathed at the same time, but almost at the same time, the atmosphere between them had changed quietly.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu&rsquo;s instinctive body moved and wanted to move forward, but after he looked at the two people around him, he frowned and slowly regained his body.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s expression was startled at first, and then a bright light flashed in her eyes. She frowned slightly in the face of this ancient sword, which has a supreme position in Qingyun and even in the world. Then, she subconsciously looked at the side of the ghost, looking at his face, she quietly, and the ghost opened a distance.</p>
<p>He was silent as if his face was expressionless, but in his eyes, he was burning like fireworks.</p>
<p>The sword, an ancient sword that has been in nightmares day and night for ten years, stands out in front of you. The simple blade of the sword seems to twinkle in the breeze of the mountain, reflecting in his eyes, as if it had penetrated into his chest.</p>
<p>That one, the graceful and powerless green figure falling gently in mid air</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He seemed to burst out from his chest with a roar of fury, tearing his heart and lung, and rushed towards the ancient sword of Zhuxian. The dark blue light flashed up, and the soul devouring roared in front of him, as if feeling the master&rsquo;s mood.</p>
<p>But suddenly, a blue sword came out from the side. Lin Jingyu held the dragon sword in his hand, and blocked him in front of him. The blue green sword in his anger blocked the dark green and black gas from the screeching.</p>
<p>With a dull sound, two magic weapons have collided and returned in mid air. Lin Jingyu is about to stop drinking.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, I felt that although I was in the daytime, my whole body was accompanied by that strange magic weapon. Suddenly, the sky and the earth were dim and the ghosts were roaring around. My body was like being bound by countless invisible threads. Even in front of me, I could not help but have all kinds of horrible illusions of the nine hell hell hell.</p>
<p>And in front of the ghost, I don&rsquo;t know when the eyes have become blood red again, murderous gas. The body is more like a ghost.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu opened his eyes and drank. In the dark air, the blue light soared and jumped from the sky. Almost at the same time, the ghost&rsquo;s shadow had reached his place in an instant. The black air spread like a monster&rsquo;s wings and gathered like a ghost&rsquo;s hand, drowning the ghost&rsquo;s figure, rolling like a raging wave from all directions to the ancient sword of killing immortals.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu was forced to retreat in mid air. He was in a great hurry and wanted to drink furiously when he saw the ancient sword of Zhuxian. In the depth of the black gas, a bright light like autumn water blooms like frost and snow. The clear sound is clang, reverberating far away, in the dark air. Blooming like flowers, a sword stabbed out.</p>
<p>Tianya!</p>
<p>The white light, like snow and frost, streaked through the air, where the black gas decadent, straight to the deepest front, blocking the way.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi appears in front of the ancient sword of Zhuxian. Her face is expressionless, but her face is white as if there is no trace of blood.</p>
<p>Deep in the black air, two bright spots like ghost fire were staring at Lu Xueqi, and the ghost was howling and furious.</p>
<p>Like what, in front, like wild animals roaring and panting, so strange?</p>
<p>The black gas suddenly rose from the ground to several feet in the air. In the black air, those two fierce ghost fires disappeared. Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s mouth slightly twitched, and her face was still pale and expressionless. She had only one eye, and the light in her eyes kept flashing. Like thousands of mountains and rivers, she passed by in an instant, and her mind was still on her mind for a moment.</p>
<p>However, Tianya in her hand still refused to give up. The ancient sword behind her suddenly seemed to have changed into a abyss, which made her unable to retreat!</p>
<p>An ancient sword, or a silent and ancient school that raised her?</p>
<p>She raised her sword to the sky and stabbed it quietly. The light of the sword was like snow, but with a trace of desolation.</p>
<p>In the middle of the sky, the ghost roared. In the middle of the sky, it was in the direction of Tianya&rsquo;s stabbing. The dark shadow suddenly appeared, and the ghost appeared from the depth of the black gas. But in front of him, the soul devouring spirit flew up. In an instant, the originally overwhelming black air was diffused down, and the whole body of the Black Soul Eater screamed unceasingly. All the strange blood red filaments on the end of the stick had been lit up.</p>
<p>A pale hand, stretched out from the air, grasped the Soul Eater. From the sky down, the wind and smoke were overwhelming. Countless black gas condensed into a column at the front end of the soul swallowing, and hit it in the air.</p>
<p>Towards Lu Xueqi, also toward her behind, that silent ancient sword.</p>
<p>But, after all, she did not retreat</p>
<p>The sword is like snow, sprinkling towards the black air. Before it is touched, the surrounding rocks and dust have been vigorously rolled up and whirled like a storm. Lu Xueqi stood in the center of the vortex, her face gradually blurred.</p>
<p>Tianya and soul swallowing, the two magic weapons flying and shining in the air, seem to vibrate gently, as if the fight many years ago came back to our eyes.</p>
<p>But the time is short, such as the mood in a blink of an eye, the fierce roar, finally resounded in the blue clouds before the moon cave.</p>
<p>The wind and smoke quietly dispersed, the dust fell, and a few small stones were turning on the ground alone, and they could not help rolling to the distance. Finally, they rolled into the grass and could not be seen again.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi still stood in place, her body did not move half a minute from the original place. Behind her, the ancient sword of Zhuxian seems to be emitting a simple light, gazing at the back of the woman.</p>
<p>Somehow, the peerless woman&rsquo;s eyes and face at the moment were so tired, like the sword just now, which had exhausted her mental strength and physical strength.</p>
<p>She looked at the unknown place with her head down and indifferent eyes. I don&rsquo;t know how much time, she slowly looked up, looking in front of her.</p>
<p>The man!</p>
<p>That crazy man!</p>
<p>The silent man</p>
<p>Such a pair of eyes, silently watching her. There is no killing, no anger, no love and tenderness.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s body suddenly shuddered for a moment, so slight. Even she almost thought it was her own illusion, but the pain that suddenly made her stoop and fall on the ground suddenly, like the sharpest steel needle in the world, passed through her deep heart.</p>
<p>Her face was as white as snow.</p>
<p>Suddenly red, the body gently swayed, in the moment of frown slightly, at the moment when she seemed to bite her teeth, she suddenly closed her eyes and bent down.</p>
<p>With a &ldquo;hiss&rdquo; sound, Tianya plunges upside down into the ground. Lu Xueqi holds the sword handle and spits out a small mouthful of blood, splashing on the edge of the sword like autumn water.</p>
<p>Blood. Gradually condensed into beads, attached to the smooth blade of Tianya, trembled slightly, and then slipped quietly.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know where the wind blowing, in the open space before the magic moon cave, swaying leisurely past, the wind still with a few light whistles.</p>
<p>The black air dissipated, and the ghost stood there, with a dark blue light shining. Falling from the sky, he reached for it.</p>
<p>Then in the Guili blink of an eye to look at Lu Xueqi, Lin Jingyu has already turned back and flashed around Lu Xueqi. He blocked the ancient sword of killing immortals behind him.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu looked at Lin Jingyu coldly, and then turned to Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s face. These two people are almost the most important people in the world for him now. In his eyes, they are no different from strangers.</p>
<p>human world. A lifetime, but how many people, can accompany the end of life, the same life?</p>
<p>He gritted his teeth, bared his teeth, smiling but proud, resolute and rebellious, and strode forward. The ancient sword is just ahead. Even if it is a bottomless abyss, he will rush to it! Ten years of time, ten years of cone heart pain, how can one day give up?</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu&rsquo;s face was angry. She cut the dragon in her hand and the green light rose again. At this moment, Lu Xueqi stood up straight. Although her face became paler, her voice seemed to be as clear and moving as ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stopped for a moment, then took a deep look at Lu Xueqi and said, &ldquo;get out of my way!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi, with a sad look on her face, said, &ldquo;listen to me and go! Never come back. &quot;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu frowns and takes a look at Lu Xueqi, but he stops talking.</p>
<p>GUI Li listened, but didn&rsquo;t mean to lead Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s heart. He sneered: &ldquo;you let me destroy Zhu Xian, I&rsquo;ll go right away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi shook her head wearily and said in a low voice, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t let you do that. The people in front of the mountain are coming soon. You can go now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li and Lin Jingyu were stunned at the same time and listened attentively. As expected, they heard a faint noise of people in the distance. It seemed that there were still a large number of people arguing about what to shout.</p>
<p>In fact, it is not surprising to think about it carefully. The ancient sword of killing immortals is a magic weapon in Qingyun gate. Its importance is incomparable. Qingyun gate can&rsquo;t be found everywhere in the front mountain battlefield, so it naturally searches for the back mountain. Don&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s the back mountain, but turn the whole Qingyun Mountain upside down. In order to kill the immortal ancient sword, I&rsquo;m afraid the disciples of Qingyun gate are willing to do it.</p>
<p>Listening to the noise in the distance gradually increased, listening more and more clearly, obviously the crowd is searching here. GUI Li&rsquo;s face became colder and colder. Suddenly, he snorted coldly. He was reckless and flew towards Lu Xueqi and Lin Jingyu.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi looks miserable, but before she has any action, Lin Jingyu has already pulled out of her body. The sound of &ldquo;Wu&rdquo; of the Dragon Sword stabs in the air like a split silk. The sword is so powerful that it is almost like a dragon&rsquo;s teeth and claws and pounces on the ghost.</p>
<p>GUI Li&rsquo;s face was gloomy and cold, and his body was like a ghost. With a wave of his left hand, the ghost eating magic wand flew out again. However, he ignored the power of the dragon sword and directly hit Lin Jingyu&rsquo;s head. Lin Jingyu is one of the stunned. This kind of fighting is strong and brave, but it is more like Lin Jingyu&rsquo;s style in the past. He didn&rsquo;t want to be vicious, but he used it on him in turn. However, in the face of such fierce attacks, Lin Jingyu&rsquo;s strong pride was aroused bit by bit, and he drank a lot. As expected, he ignored the soul eating magic wand and chopped the dragon sword. His intention was to gamble with GUI Li to see who had more courage!</p>
<p>As soon as they fight each other, Lu Xueqi beside her can&rsquo;t help shaking her body. She can&rsquo;t help but feel a little worried in her eyes.</p>
<p>At the scene, when they were about to die together, the ghost suddenly shook in place and scattered around like black smoke, almost like an illusion. Lin Jingyu can&rsquo;t stop. He stabs the empty man and flies forward. In my heart, I cried out that it was not good. I looked back in a panic, but I saw a black figure like a phantom, appearing behind me like a ghost. Fly to Lu Xueqi.</p>
<p>Naturally, such strange skills are not owned by the Taoist methods of Qingyun gate and Tianyin temple, and have never been seen in the demon religion. They are the strange skills that ghosts and Li gradually realize after reading the three volumes of the book of heaven. Not to be seen by the world. Today&rsquo;s trial was a great success. Even Lin Jingyu and other figures were also kept from the past. Even in Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s eyes, she couldn&rsquo;t help feeling a little suspicious.</p>
<p>But somehow, the whole body seems to be completely different from that just now. It&rsquo;s not like the ordinary people think. It&rsquo;s full of evil spirits and black gas. On his face, green, gold, red and red Qi appear in turn, with a faint look of pain. But the body is as fast as the wind, which seems to be a step further than the just in time.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi was surprised, but vaguely understood. Different from Lin Jingyu, she and GUI Li saw the mysterious third volume of the book of heaven at the same time in the &ldquo;treasure house of the emperor of heaven&rdquo; on the sacred tree in the Western Everglades. Compared with GUI Li, she and GUI Li had already kept the book firmly in mind.</p>
<p>Although the book of heaven is strange and unpredictable, it is full of profound and profound theories between the lines. It&rsquo;s also a lie to say that she didn&rsquo;t study hard these years. After all, she did not tell others. Moreover, what she saw was only the third volume of the book of heaven, which was broken before and after, especially the lack of the first volume of the general outline of the book of heaven, which made her unable to start and was obscure. Over the years, she has been smart with her own talent. Forcible comprehension is more or less helpful to one&rsquo;s own practice, but it is not obvious. However, because of this, the elders of Qingyun gate didn&rsquo;t find out. Otherwise, Taoist immortal, Tian Buyi, master Shuiyue and other characters would not notice the strangeness of Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s practice.</p>
<p>At this moment, Lu Xueqi looks at the strange body method and frowns slightly. However, after the ghost cheated Lin Jingyu, her body is like an invisible thing in the air, condensed by black smoke and quickly transformed into his own appearance. However, the speed of Lu Xueqi did not decrease at all, but flew straight to Lu Xueqi.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi bit her teeth, and suddenly she stepped back three steps to her side. Unexpectedly, she let the ancient sword of Zhuxian close behind her and appeared in front of the ghost. Lin Jingyu and Lin Jingyu, who was in the distance, were startled. The difference was that Gui Li&rsquo;s face lit up with a light of joy, but Lin Jingyu had already cried out in anger: &ldquo;sister Lu, what are you doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi turned a deaf ear, and her eyes flashed a flash of light, as if she hesitated for a moment, but she finally gave a light drink, and the Tianya sword stabbed out in the wind, but the sword pointed to the opposite direction, which was three feet to the right of Zhuxian ancient sword.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poof!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a slight sound, the Tianya sword seems to have pierced the air, but somehow, Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s body was shocked. After a moment of silence, the sword&rsquo;s edge splashed blood and splashed into the air. On the other side, he was flying to the devil who killed the immortals. In the air, he let out a sharp roar of &ldquo;ah&rdquo;, which turned into a burst of black smoke and drifted away.</p>
<p>In the midst of the startling electric light and fire, when the blood was splashing like a flower, Lu Xueqi was pale and in a trance, a roar came suddenly, and the black figure suddenly flashed in the sky. The Tianya sword was inserted into his shoulder, but it seemed that he could not feel the pain at all. The blood sucking beads in the front of the soul eating magic wand were red with blood, and a blood eating Demon power spread the sky cover Lu Xueqi was enveloped in the earth.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi looks pale. She feels that her whole body&rsquo;s essence and blood are boiling like boiling hot water. She is about to break out of her body. She is buzzing in her mind. She can&rsquo;t bear the pain. Her feet are soft and she can&rsquo;t support her any more. She sits down.</p>
<p>In the moment of blood sucking beads shining in front of Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s beautiful face, Shengsheng twisted back and waved her left hand to sweep Lu Xueqi out. As Lu Xueqi flew out, the Tianya sword also went away. At the moment of pulling out the sword, the blood on the ghostly shoulder flowed out like a spring. While Lu Xueqi is in the air, the Demon power of blood sucking beads is still turbulent and incessant. Her chest aches violently, and her breath of blood gushes out.</p>
<p>In the field, the ghost fell down and there was nothing else in his eyes, only the ancient sword of killing immortals. At the moment, his whole body was covered with blood, and half of his body was quickly dyed red with blood. However, he felt as if he didn&rsquo;t feel it. He looked straight at the ancient sword of Zhuxian.</p>
<p>The simple and unsophisticated ancient sword of killing immortals was quietly embedded in front of him, and the blade of the sword could not even reflect his face. Only that one light thin crack, as if new.</p>
<p>In the past ten years, the years flashed by one by one, not to mention, the left hand suddenly stretched out to hold the sword handle, the right hand drew back the soul eating magic wand and held it tightly in his hand. He fiercely attacked the blade of Zhuxian sword and hit the trace.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu roared in the back and ran after him, but it was too late. Lu Xueqi had just fallen down, and her mind was in a state of chaos. In the distance, the noise of the group of people suddenly rose. It seemed that they had found something, and they all rushed to the magic moon cave.</p>
<p>But, in that moment of time, who can do what?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, no one can save a moment!</p>
<p>The soul swallowing with black light was roaring down in the air. Its owner was bleeding like a flood at the moment. It ran down his left hand and fell on Zhuxian. It crossed Zhuxian&rsquo;s seemingly rough blade. It disappeared slowly, but never fell to the ground.</p>
<p>Vaguely, at that moment, his heart moved, as if there were some strange and familiar scenes that touched his mind, and flashed through his mind like lightning.</p>
<p>A moment later, he suddenly woke up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s blood!</p>
<p>At that moment, he saw his blood flowing to the blade of Zhuxian ancient sword, especially when it flowed to the crack. He quickly and quietly integrated into the ancient sword of Zhuxian.</p>
<p>legend of chusen! legend of chusen! legend of chusen!</p>
<p>Zhuxian, like blood sucking beads, can suck the essence of living creatures!</p>
<p>He was stunned and could not hold on to himself, but the magic wand that fell on his hand had already exceeded the speed of his mind, and had been forced to fight on the ancient sword of killing immortals! (to be continued. )</p>
