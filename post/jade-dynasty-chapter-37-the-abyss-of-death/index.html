      <p>Zhang Xiaofan watched them fall into trouble, and rushed up at once. In his eyes, the big man turned his head slightly and shot out a red light, rushing to Zhang Xiaofan.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan has no way to go back. Although Qi Hao and Zeng Shushu are in his eyes, they can&rsquo;t do anything when it comes to the end. So he has to sacrifice the fire stick to meet them.</p>
<p>In the middle of the sky, the red awn and the fire staff with a light dark green light met and disappeared in a blink of an eye. Zhang Xiaofan felt that a strong force was coming from the air, and his body shook for a while, but there was no other feeling. He hurriedly looked to the fire stick, but saw that the black fire stick was as usual, without red marks.</p>
<p>Although the fire stick was still ugly, Zhang Xiaofan was overjoyed and hurriedly took a step forward. However, all the people of the demon sect in the distance were shocked. They all looked at this place one after another. The big man &ldquo;eh&rdquo; made a sound, and there was another red light in his eyes.</p>
<p>After a while, the red light dissipated and the staff shook, but it was still safe. Zhang Xiaofan put down his heart and thought that his fire staff was ugly, but as the saying goes, people are cheap and hard. It seems that most of the magic weapons are the same. The immortal swords of the two elder martial brothers are beautiful and noble, but they are not as hard as their humble things.</p>
<p>In his mind, such a mess of thoughts flashed, but at his feet he did not stop, slowly forced to the big man. At this time, the original relaxed look of the big man has disappeared, and most of his attention has been focused on the seemingly weakest Zhang Xiaofan. At the place where Qi Hao and Zeng Shushu are located, they just put a red light to block their progress, while for Zhang Xiaofan, they shoot continuously.</p>
<p>Although it can be seen that Zhang Xiaofan was obviously laborious when every red light flashed, the black whirring stick was not harmed by it, and the ferocity of the red light seemed to have no effect on the young man. Under the gaze of all the people, Zhang Xiaofan came here step by step.</p>
<p>In a twinkling of an eye, there was a little sweat on the big man&rsquo;s forehead, which was in his heart. In any case, I can&rsquo;t think of it. The red devil&rsquo;s eye, which I have spent three hundred years to cultivate, has great effect on those treasures of the immortal family. Why can&rsquo;t I help this seemingly ordinary fire staff?</p>
<p>In fact, he didn&rsquo;t know. Red devil&rsquo;s eye is powerful. It can defile the immortal Qi by beating Qi Hao and other immortal swords with its fierce and bloody Qi. It takes the sword body as the way to slowly force the evil Qi into their bodies. It was invincible at the beginning.</p>
<p>However, Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s seemingly unsightly fire stick is a black stick with unknown origin in the back mountain valley of Dazhu peak and the most fierce thing of the demon sect in those days. It is melted by Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s blood essence. If we only talk about evil spirit, we don&rsquo;t know how many times the &ldquo;blood bead&rdquo; is better than the &ldquo;Red Devil&rsquo;s eye&rdquo;. Besides, there&rsquo;s a nameless black stick that is no different from the &ldquo;blood bead&rdquo;.</p>
<p>These two monstrous things are fused into one, and they are controlled by each other. On the contrary, the murderous Qi is restrained, and there is Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s blood essence contained in it. Therefore, only Zhang Xiaofan can urge it, which is also the reason. Only then can we hide from the elders of Qingyun sect, and Zhang Xiaofan turns back at the gate of hell.</p>
<p>But at this moment, the big man wants to attack the fire stick with the red eyes of the red devil. Naturally, he has no success. Zhang Xiaofan is still young and ignorant. He has a treasure and doesn&rsquo;t know it. If he changes to the old black heart old man who was the ancestor of the demon sect thousands of years ago, he can suck the big man&rsquo;s blood and flesh with just a few dances. There was only one red eye on his body.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that none of the people here can think of these strange things. When the big man was staring at the enemy but still couldn&rsquo;t stop Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s step-by-step approach, the evil faced young man standing beside him silently from the beginning sneered and said: &ldquo;elder brother. It&rsquo;s useless in your red devil&rsquo;s eyes. You can&rsquo;t even deal with a few young Qingyun generation. Thanks to your scolding of the wild dog just now, I think it&rsquo;s better to give your position as the patriarch to me. &quot;</p>
<p>The face of the young man and the young woman on the other side changed. The beautiful young woman frowned at first and said: &ldquo;Lin Feng, you are the enemy right now. How can you say that? &quot;</p>
<p>Lin Feng, who is full of evil spirits, inclined to take a look at Qingyun gate. When he saw Lu Xueqi, he looked at it more specially. Then he sneered and said, &ldquo;these yellow boys are also enemies. Why should our blood refining hall stand on the holy gate of immortal sect? What can we talk about to restore the great cause created by the elder black heart thousands of years ago?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man, surnamed Nian, shot a red light at Zhang Xiaofan, temporarily stopped him from moving forward, and then angrily said to Lin Feng, &ldquo;what else can you do besides boasting, if you don&rsquo;t come up and try?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a strange smile on Lin Feng&rsquo;s pale face and he said, &ldquo;OK, I&rsquo;ll make you convinced.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took out a gold drawing fan from his arms and fanned it to himself.</p>
<p>All the people in Qingyun sect heard their conversation and were more alert to the evil young man. But after a long time, they were shocked to see that the young man was just shaking his fan without any hesitation, but he was motionless.</p>
<p>Is it true that Lin Feng is only able to boast?</p>
<p>That year, the eldest brother was even angry with him. He said angrily, &ldquo;Lin Feng, if you don&rsquo;t have the ability, you can stand aside. I can deal with these young Qingyun people by myself. I don&rsquo;t need you to talk coldly, and I don&rsquo;t want to see what you can do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Lin Feng&rsquo;s face changed, he snorted coldly and said, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to join hands with you. I won&rsquo;t win, but now I don&rsquo;t show my hands. Do you think I can&rsquo;t cheat you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as he spoke, he threw the gold drawing fan in his hand into the air. The whole fan gave off a light golden light in the air. He brushed the ground and opened it.</p>
<p>On top of the gold fan, there is a fine brush painting of a mountain, a river and a giant ROC. The strokes are delicate and lifelike.</p>
<p>Wind, clouds, thunder, lightning.</p>
<p>This place was originally deep in the earth. It shouldn&rsquo;t have appeared in the ancient grottoes. But at the moment, the four people in Qingyun gate are all seeing this. At the place where he was horrified, suddenly there was a loud noise. The precious fan trembled in the air. After a while, the mountains in the picture in the fan were born and moved out. The wind was long when he saw it. In the roar, there were hundreds of feet of high hills. The huge space was almost filled up, and then the four people of Qingyun gate were pressed down like the top of Mount Tai.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was shocked, but when he saw that the huge object was pressed down, he couldn&rsquo;t resist at all. He didn&rsquo;t care much. He flew back with a full push. He saw that the mountain was pressed down, but he still had half of his body in it. He was about to be pressed in two. Suddenly, he was led by someone. It was pulled out.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan looked back, but Qi Hao saved his life. At this critical moment of life and death, his heart suddenly flashed with inexplicable bitterness. But in a low voice, &ldquo;thank you, elder martial brother Qi.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Qi Hao didn&rsquo;t think of what this kid was thinking. He nodded his head slightly with a serious face. He stepped back quickly just now, and saw Zhang Xiaofan right beside him. He was given a free hand.</p>
<p>However, the huge Hill suddenly appeared in front of us was a headache. We saw that the hill was suddenly pushed down, the ground was shaking violently and the stone walls were shaking. Even the rock dome over a hundred feet fell into the ground with rubble like rain, which was so powerful and shocking.</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu also returned, but he was stunned and said: &ldquo;mountain and river fans! This is the magic weapon of the ancestor of Fengyue in Jieshi mountain. How could it fall on this man? &quot;</p>
<p>Everyone was surprised. Zhang Xiaofan is not good, but Qi Hao has a wide experience. However, he knows that Fengyue ancestor is a well-known cultivator in the eastern Jieshi mountain. He has a high level of Taoism and is famous in the way of cultivation. His ordinary behavior is between good and evil, and there is no great evil and no struggle with the world. Therefore, the good and evil ways did not provoke this person, but he did not expect that this young man would have the magic weapon of watching the house of Fengyue ancestor Among these monsters.</p>
<p>People were wondering, but the mountain rose up again without any feeling. I don&rsquo;t know how much power it takes to move this huge thing.</p>
<p>After seeing all the people, there are stone walls, which can&rsquo;t be retreated. On the huge hills, there are stones like rain, lightning and thunder. It&rsquo;s just a matter of life and death. Everyone in Qingyun gate is in a hurry. As soon as Qihao bites his teeth, he will stand up and guard them with six mirror, intending to fight against the mountain with great momentum. Suddenly I saw a flash of blue shadow, and Lu Xueqi suddenly appeared in front of the three. There was a roar in the Qing Dynasty, but the blue light soared. The &ldquo;Tianya&rdquo; divine sword, the dragon, was singing out of its sheath. It was full of immortal spirit and went straight to the dome.</p>
<p>The thunder in the sky is more urgent. The mountain is invincible. It should cover its head and crush four people into meat cakes. Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s face is like frost, her long hair is flying in the wind, like a nine day fairy! The body of &ldquo;Tianya&rdquo; sword trembled slightly, which seemed to sense the master&rsquo;s mind. It was like a dragon leaping into the sky, rising from the sky. Ten thousand blue lights lit up the whole huge cave in an instant, and then it became one in the air, and one sword chopped to the mountain!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zheng!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sha Feishi walked, the wind was howling, and people were staring at the air, but only saw the huge air flow, which was almost like tangible things rushing around. Lu Xueqi was in the middle of the air, his face suddenly lost color, and the whole person was directly driven into the stone wall by the huge anti earthquake force.</p>
<p>However, the mountain was cut heavily by the blue light column, and the pressure stopped. It trembled a few times in the mid air. At the place where it made a loud noise, it shrank back. Without a moment, the whole mountain disappeared and reappeared in the mountain and river fan.</p>
<p>Lin Feng, the evil faced young man, looked at the mountain and river fan. His brow wrinkled. He saw only on the picture. The original majestic mountain came out from the top of the mountain to the mountainside. There was a big crack in it. So the original harmonious fan was like a broken one. It was a little stiff.</p>
<p>Here in Qingyun gate, Tianya divine sword flies back as if spiritually, but Lu Xueqi slides down from the stone wall. As soon as he lands, he feels that his feet are soft and almost will sit on the ground. Fortunately, other people have already come here. Zhang Xiaofan looks at her and holds her.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi gasps for breath, but she has a strong temperament. Zhang Xiaofan has to be pushed away, but her hands are half stretched out. Suddenly, she only feels that her lips are hot, but she is bleeding.</p>
<p>The red blood flowed on her skin like clotting fat, and the red and white color were actually breathtaking and gorgeous.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan stayed for a while, then heard that Lin Feng pointed and scolded angrily in the distance: &ldquo;good you stinky woman, how dare you damage my magic weapon, even if you die ten times, it&rsquo;s not enough to pay for your life!&rdquo; In other words, the man with evil spirit has risen from the sky. The golden light of the mountain and river fan is quite different from his evil spirit, but he is still in the air.</p>
<p>In the distance, the eldest brother of the year has stopped radiating red light, and the &ldquo;Red Devil&rsquo;s eye&rdquo; has returned to normal, standing in place. The beautiful young woman next to her took a step, looked at Lu Xueqi, Qingyun gate, and said in a low voice, &ldquo;do you see clearly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In, the eldest brother looked solemn and said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s Tianya!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young woman snorted and said, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect such a miracle to fall into the hands of this young generation!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Looking at Lin Feng, who has been fighting with all the people of Qingyun gate at the moment, the eldest brother of Nian said: &ldquo;Tianya divine sword is the nine heaven divine soldier. In those days, the heixin old man, the founder of blood refining hall, was defeated by this sword. Today, anyway, we should seize this divine sword!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The beautiful young woman nodded and said, &ldquo;that Lin Feng&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man sneered and said: &ldquo;this kid always has eyes higher than the top because of his relationship with the wind and moon ancestor. If it wasn&rsquo;t for the right time, I would not have allowed him. Let him start the battle first. You and I will seize the opportunity and seize the divine sword. &quot;</p>
<p>The young woman nodded and looked into the field.</p>
<p>Every &ldquo;mountain and River Fan&rdquo;. There was a big storm. The wind rolled down the stone and blew it to the four people of Qingyun gate. However, every time they got close, they were blocked by Qi Hao and Zeng Shushu. Just now, the mountain rose, and everyone was caught off guard. Almost helpless, but at this time I can see that these two are extraordinary.</p>
<p>Qi Hao didn&rsquo;t need to say that the white light of his icy fairy sword was shining, so he was caught by a gust of wind. Zeng Shushu, who was standing on the other side, just showed his real ability at the moment. Under Qi Hao&rsquo;s cover, the purple light of the &ldquo;Xuanyuan&rdquo; Fairy sword was flashing. Every time he got into the space of the wind, like a poisonous snake, Lin Feng was almost hurt by the purple light. We had to pay attention to deal with it. For a while, the three of them were even tied.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan stood in the rear, still holding Lu Xueqi, and watched Qi Hao and other people&rsquo;s competition. However, Qi Hao was able to use the immortal sword with ease, and he could not use the immortal method of Taoism, so he had some admiration. all the time. He was only practicing the basic skills of Taiji Xuanqing Taoism. Until he went down the mountain, Su Ru just bolted some practical Taoism to him, which was not comparable to Qi Hao.</p>
<p>At the moment he was staring into the air. Suddenly I felt my arm was loose, but Lu Xueqi rested for a while, recovered a little, and then stood on her own and left his support.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan looked at her jade white face, which was pale at the moment. He couldn&rsquo;t help but ask, &ldquo;are you ok. Elder martial sister Lu</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi glanced at him, reached out to wipe the blood on his lips, shook her head, but did not speak.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan has been familiar with her style since he knew the ice beauty. Naturally, he will not ask any more questions now. Moreover, he has always been in awe of the beautiful woman, so he turned to look at the scene.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, he just turned his head and suddenly heard Lu Xueqi make a exclamation. He was shocked to see that a black rope suddenly appeared in the stone wall behind the place where he and Lu Xueqi stood at the moment. It quickly tied Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s hands to his side and couldn&rsquo;t move. A moment later, a female figure appeared in the stone wall, just standing in the distance A beautiful young woman.</p>
<p>Only listen to her &ldquo;cackle&rdquo; smile way: &ldquo;little sister, you look so beautiful, really I see still pity, this&rdquo; tie Xian Suo &ldquo;is the elder sister specially prepared for you these righteous immortal family!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan saw the color of pain on Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s face, and then saw that &ldquo;tie Xian Suo&rdquo; had been deeply immersed in the flesh for a moment. The pain was obvious. But before he could react, there was a roar in the air. The eldest brother of the year swooped down and reached for the &ldquo;Tianya&rdquo; sword behind Lu Xueqi.</p>
<p>How can Zhang Xiaofan allow him to make a mess? The &ldquo;fire stick&rdquo; rises in the air and pours directly at the eldest brother of the year.</p>
<p>The eldest brother saw the strange black short stick again. He was afraid of it. His body was askew. He stopped and fell on the ground.</p>
<p>This is Qi Hao and Zeng Shushu in front of us. When they look back, they are shocked. They are about to turn back for help. But when Lin Feng sees these two people&rsquo;s movements, he thinks that if you want to talk about it, let&rsquo;s go. Don&rsquo;t I lose face in front of the elder brother? When the river fan goes down the mountain and roars into the wind, it&rsquo;s tight for a while, but they can&rsquo;t get it.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan temporarily pushed back the eldest brother of the year, but he did not hesitate. On one side of his body, the fire stick rushed to the beautiful young woman. Unexpectedly, the young woman smiled gently and only swung the rope in her hand. Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s whole body came across involuntarily and stood in front of her.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was so surprised that he almost couldn&rsquo;t stop. He suddenly stopped. The fire staff stopped in the first three points of Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s body, almost turning her jade face into a pale green color.</p>
<p>Before Zhang Xiaofan could breathe for a while, he heard two more stories coming up behind him. Zhang Xiaofan was in a hurry and rushed forward, which made him hide in a mess. Looking back, he found that the original wild dog Taoist and the tall Liu Hao also rushed up when the fire broke. However, the eldest brother was eager to seize the treasure, even though he didn&rsquo;t care about his identity.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan is one enemy and three enemies, and immediately falls into a bitter battle. If it wasn&rsquo;t for the eldest brother of the year who was afraid of the fire stick, Liu Hao, the wild dog, saw the terrible scene of the fire stick sucking blood in the dark just now. They were afraid of doing too much. Zhang Xiaofan had already lost.</p>
<p>But Rao is so. In a few rounds, under the attack of three magic weapons in the sky. Zhang Xiaofan is already in danger, and the most headache is the same. The beautiful young women standing beside seem to watch, but once Zhang Xiaofan intends to fight back. It was a shock in the arm that threw Lu Xueqi in. Zhang Xiaofan had to shrink back. He was frustrated for a while, and would be hurt in the hands of three monsters.</p>
<p>Under the rope. Lu Xueqi struggles hard, but it doesn&rsquo;t work. Seeing the young woman behind her, she smiles proudly. Zhang Xiaofan is afraid of hurting herself. Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s face is whiter and her heart is agitated. As soon as her throat is sweet, a mouthful of blood sprays out and sprinkles it on her clothes, which is a little red and shocking.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan hears the sound. In a flash, I thought that Lu Xueqi was hurt by the &ldquo;tie Xian Suo&rdquo;. I was so shocked that I couldn&rsquo;t care so much anymore. The fire staff suddenly took off the black air and shot at the beautiful young woman as fast as lightning.</p>
<p>The young woman didn&rsquo;t expect Zhang Xiaofan to stand up in spite of her own safety. For a while, she didn&rsquo;t take precautions. Seeing this fire stick, she rushed to her eyes and rushed to the sky. That&rsquo;s the way to avoid danger.</p>
<p>But at the same time, Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s back is also open. The red devil eyes of the old man shoot a red light. The fangs magic weapon of the wild dog Taoist and the Yellow flying sword of Liu Hao hit Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s back together.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s eyes darkened and he almost fainted. After the sharp pain, almost a numbness, the whole person flew straight forward. In the middle of the sky, the blood in his mouth has been gushing out like a spring.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi sees in the eye, the shell tooth deeply bites in the lip, suddenly felt on the body tie Xian rope to loosen a pine. However, the beautiful young woman was distracted by Zhang Xiaofan and temporarily forgot to control the tie Xiansuo.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi made a clear roar, and her hands continued to stretch in the limited space, turning them into orchid fingers. The &ldquo;Tianya&rdquo; magic sword suddenly came out of its sheath, and the blue light flashed across the sky, and the &ldquo;KaKa&rdquo; made two sounds, which forced the Xiansuo to open a circle. However, under the God front of &ldquo;Tianya&rdquo;, the seemingly ordinary &ldquo;tie Xian Suo&rdquo; is extremely tough and continuous, but also &ldquo;Zizi&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The young woman was in love with the treasure, and she was shocked by the power of heaven. She quickly took the rope back. As soon as Lu Xueqi was free, although she was in pain, she immediately jumped up and caught Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p>However, before the two of them had a chance to breathe, the elderly and other three had followed.</p>
<p>Tianya&rsquo;s blue light flashed and flew back to Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s body to protect the owner, but Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s face was as white as paper, and her body was shaking.</p>
<p>At this moment, suddenly listening to the distant &ldquo;Instigation&rdquo;, with a cry of pain, Lin Feng said angrily, &ldquo;young Qingyun, how dare you hurt me? Look at the magic weapon!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roar&rdquo; resounds everywhere in this huge cave!</p>
<p>They were in a state of horror, but when they were old, they stopped and went to bed. They opened their mouths and shouted, &ldquo;brother Lin, don&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before he finished speaking, the people felt that the mountains were shaking and the ground was moving under his feet. Once again, Lin Feng saw that the big river in the mountain and river fan had disappeared from the pictures in the fan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow!&rdquo; With a loud and deafening sound, the people&rsquo;s flat ground cracked, and suddenly a huge jet of water came out from the bottom of the earth. The power was so huge that the huge stones were also rushed into the air, only the stone in front with the words &ldquo;dead soul yuan&rdquo; could not move.</p>
<p>The four people of Qingyun gate were rushed around with great force. Lu Xueqi was relieved. Suddenly, she felt that her heart seemed to sink.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s body is full of bloodstains, floating out gently. In front of him is the mysterious dark abyss!</p>
<p>She looked in the middle of the air deeply, only for a moment, but it seemed that she had been in the past, scene by scene, passing through her heart“</p>
<p>Qingyun Mountain, the youth who saw her blush when drawing lots;</p>
<p>At the time of the competition, the soft eyes suddenly appeared in the thunderbolt and wind;</p>
<p>Just now for her hematemesis, recklessly rushed to save her people ah!</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi bit her teeth and cold her face when a boulder hit her head. With the last effort, she stretched out her hand on the boulder to change her direction and flew to Zhang Xiaofan.</p>
<p>The stones are like rain, and the water dragons are ferocious. However, it seems that all these things are in the sky. The &ldquo;Tianya&rdquo; magic sword sends out a light blue light and follows the master.</p>
<p>Avoiding a few stones, Lu Xueqi catches up with Zhang Xiaofan, grabs his hand, and is about to pull him back, but she only feels the last strength in her body and is away from her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is she here to save me?&rdquo; Zhang Xiaofan saw Lu Xueqi in front of his blurred eyes and read a sentence in his heart. Suddenly, he found that he and Lu Xueqi had flown over the huge stone with three characters of &ldquo;dead spirit abyss&rdquo;, which was emitting a strong light, and fell into the abyss.</p>
<p>Then they went down.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi seems to have lost consciousness, closed her eyes, turned to the side, and looked at her white face at the moment, as if she had a happy look.</p>
<p>Before Zhang Xiaofan fell into the bottomless abyss, which seemed to be eternal darkness, he stayed in the light for a moment, vaguely heard a Buddha&rsquo;s name, and then the golden light rose.</p>
<p>The next moment, he fell into darkness.</p>
<p>Boundless darkness, as if eternal, even the woman close to him, he did not see a trace of half.</p>
<p>However, at the last moment when he lost consciousness, he still knew that Lu Xueqi and his hands were still tightly held together.</p>
<p>Even he felt vaguely that the hand was so cold at this time.</p>
<p>The boundless darkness swallowed everything. (to be continued. )</p>
