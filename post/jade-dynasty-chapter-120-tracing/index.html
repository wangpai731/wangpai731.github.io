      <p>Burning grain.</p>
<p>Tianxiangju.</p>
<p>This is a quiet place deep in the burning Valley, built close to the mountains. Surrounded by high walls on three sides, only the front door is hidden, making people not clear the scene inside.</p>
<p>In spite of the great changes that have taken place in the incense Valley these days, there are still no disciples of the incense Valley nearby, because this is the residence of the leader of the incense Valley, Yun Yilan, and the place where he is closed.</p>
<p>Since yunyilan began to close, all disciples of the burning incense valley are forbidden to enter here. Of course, the disciples of the burning incense Valley in the periphery are naturally defensible as iron walls. In addition to the official policy that Yun Yilan has always relied on, only his own disciple Li Xun can come in and meet his mentor.</p>
<p>As for others including the elders, such as Lv Shun and others, they are also forbidden to enter or leave.</p>
<p>Even when the XuanHuo altar of incendiary valley was infiltrated, the Nine Tailed Tianhu, which had been suppressed for three hundred years, and even the legendary treasure xuanhuojian of incendiary Valley, were likely to appear, yunyilan didn&rsquo;t even go out of the pass, just by letting the superior officials preside over the overall situation.</p>
<p>He is in that small courtyard. What is it?</p>
<p>This question, from time to time, haunts many disciples of the burning incense valley.</p>
<p>As the sky began to light up, shangguance opened the door gently in the moist morning air, walked in, and then closed the door.</p>
<p>What appeared in front of him was that he had been familiar with a small courtyard, several bodhi trees, gently shaking the branches in the morning wind, except for a path in the middle, surrounded by green grass. There is nothing else.</p>
<p>The leader of one of the three great schools in the world seems to live in a simple place.</p>
<p>At the end of the path, there is a two-way hut with white tile and grey walls, built on the mountain. The door made of Tung wood is painted purple, which is just like a cover.</p>
<p>Shangguance went over, pushed the door open and closed it again.</p>
<p>There was a sudden silence around. As if all the troubles of the world were shut out of the house between his hands.</p>
<p>There was no one in room, just a few simple furniture. There seems to be a thin layer of dust on the table and chair.</p>
<p>The superior officer decided to calm down and went straight to the inner room. He came to a cabinet and opened the drawer on the left. A moment later, a low voice sounded behind him.</p>
<p>The whole wall slowly retreated to the right, revealing the hard rock of the mountain wall and the dark road dug out in the middle, which only allowed one person to walk.</p>
<p>Without hesitation, shangguance went in. Soon after his figure disappeared in the dark path, the door closed slowly, and no trace could be seen.</p>
<p>In the dark. Every not too far away, there are pebble sized stones that will shine for lighting. While he was walking, he didn&rsquo;t feel stuffy. Naturally, there was another ventilation channel here.</p>
<p>The secret road was not long. He soon got to his destination, a stone chamber about the size of the inner room just outside. There was nothing in the stone room, but there was a screen in the middle, which blocked his eyes.</p>
<p>Suddenly, from behind the screen. There was a very old voice: &ldquo;is it Shangguan junior brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shangguance took two steps forward, stopped four or five steps away from the screen, and respectfully said: &ldquo;exactly, elder martial brother. How are you? &quot;</p>
<p>The voice seems to be Yun Yilan, the famous incense Valley master, but I don&rsquo;t know why. In the past, he was as famous as XuanZhen immortal of Qingyun gate and Puhong master of Tianyin temple. Now, his voice almost sounds like a dying old man with weak spirit and weak spirit.</p>
<p>Just listen to him like a low smile, light way: &ldquo;my body? Are you ok. Let&rsquo;s just wait for death. &quot;</p>
<p>Shangguan CE&rsquo;s face was moving. His expression was complicated. He was about to say something, but he was cut off by Yun Yilan&rsquo;s weak voice: &ldquo;how&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The superior officer thought for a moment and said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s probably found out that the gold bottle of the devil&rsquo;s joy sect provoked the fishman in the night of the accident. I think it&rsquo;s because she was killed by the fishman under the joy sect in the dead water, so I took revenge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cloud Yi Lan was silent for a moment behind the screen, and her voice suddenly sank down, saying, &ldquo;she can detect the great things we have planned secretly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shangguan CE&rsquo;s body suddenly gave a slight pause. For a moment, the voice behind the screen suddenly filled with majesty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet, in my opinion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good,&rdquo; said Yun Yilan with a clear sigh of relief. &ldquo;Otherwise, the matter will be leaked out. Many years of hard work will inevitably lead to a failure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chief officer said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t worry, elder martial brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cloud Yi Lan dun for a while, way: &ldquo;that sneaks into Xuan Huo altar to let go nine tail day fox evil spirit person, check out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The superior officer said: &ldquo;last night, martial nephew Li Xun and Ke Ruhui tracked down jinpinger near Tianshui stronghold. They heard that he came back this morning and told us that Gui li of devil cult ghost King sect also appeared there and calculated secretly, which led to Ke Ruhui&rsquo;s death. Fortunately, Lu Xueqi, who came to southern Xinjiang last night on behalf of immortal daoxuan to inquire about his elder martial brother, passed by halfway to help, which was able to get rid of the attack of the two monsters. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Devilish?&rdquo; Cloud Yi Lan&rsquo;s voice stopped for a while and said: &ldquo;is it Zhang Xiaofan who betrayed Qingyun ten years ago?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shangguan made a point and said: &ldquo;it was that man. In the first World War of Qingyun Mountain, Zhang Xiaofan rebelled against Qingyun. In just ten years, Taoism has made rapid progress. Now he is the No. 1 general under the ghost king.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yun Yilan snorted and said, &ldquo;old Taoist Xuan is old, and his head is a little confused. He can&rsquo;t use such talents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shangguance smiled and then said: &ldquo;martial nephew Li Xun came back and said that he suspected that the person who sneaked into the XuanHuo altar that night was a devil, but to rescue the Nine Tailed Tianhu, without the magic of the secret of our burning incense Valley, only the XuanHuo Jian of the essence of fire can unlock the prison of xuanhuolian. In his opinion, I&rsquo;m afraid that the xuanhuojian is on the ghost. &quot;</p>
<p>Cloud Yi Lan is silent for a while, suddenly tunnel: &ldquo;how do you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shangguance&rsquo;s face changed across the screen, and a moment later Gong said, &ldquo;I also think it&rsquo;s possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yun Yilan&rsquo;s voice came from behind the screen and said: &ldquo;when I met with Taoist Xuan, he boasted that he was a decent man and always thought that he would let go and not kill me. Do you remember that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The superior officer was stunned. He didn&rsquo;t know why Yun Yilan suddenly mentioned the long story, but he only nodded: &ldquo;yes, I was beside elder martial brother at that time. I remember that it&rsquo;s very clear, and that&rsquo;s exactly what immortal daoxuan said. &quot;</p>
<p>With a faint smile, yunyilan said: &ldquo;but ten years ago, Qingyun Mountain was on the top of the sky. What&rsquo;s his mood when he uses the ancient sword to chop the disciple named Zhang Xiaofan? I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s better to kill than to let it go! &quot;</p>
<p>The superior officer&rsquo;s policy was silent.</p>
<p>Cloud Yi Lan low smile, and then said: &ldquo;you go! It&rsquo;s better for you to preside over the affairs here. &quot;</p>
<p>The superior officer hesitated for a moment and asked, &ldquo;that ghost is there&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The voice of yunyilan came clearly from behind the screen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better to kill.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t let it go! &quot;</p>
<p>The superior officer made a muscle move on his face, nodded and said, &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Say, turn around and go.</p>
<p>After a while, his figure disappeared in the dark road. A moment later, the low sound of mechanism sounded. It was obvious that he opened the dark door and went out.</p>
<p>In the quiet stone room, yunyilan&rsquo;s laughter suddenly rang, with a trace of desolation and irony: &ldquo;what do you think. It&rsquo;s all pushed on xun&rsquo;er. He thinks it&rsquo;s his guess. Do you think I don&rsquo;t know? Three hundred years ago, you missed your duty and lost xuanhuojian. But three hundred years later, younger martial brother! You still haven&rsquo;t made much progress! &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha ha, ha ha&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bleak and bleak laughter, in the cold stone room, slowly reverberated.</p>
<p>After leaving tianxiangju, shangguance walked out of the door, somehow. With his practice, I can&rsquo;t help but feel relieved.</p>
<p>He settled his mind, meditated for a moment, and went out. On the way, I came to a magnificent hall with three words on the plaque</p>
<p>Mountain and river hall.</p>
<p>This name matches the tall and majestic hall, which really looks down on the world. I don&rsquo;t know if the ancestors of the burning incense Valley built this hall to meet the guests, and they also think about one day. Crown the taste of the world.</p>
<p>Shangguance thought like this in his heart and walked in slowly.</p>
<p>There are people sitting in the hall. Apart from the disciples of the burning incense Valley standing by, the guests here are mainly middle-aged people who come to greet them. There are about a dozen people, and Li Xun is sitting with them.</p>
<p>In the eyes of the top officials, the most important one is actually the two people sitting at the top.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi.</p>
<p>Dharma phase.</p>
<p>These two outstanding disciples of the two great sects of today represent the sects behind them, so although they are not as old as other old people, they are in the first place instead.</p>
<p>The Dharma phase is still a white monk robe, with a kind smile, talking with Li Xun with a smile and responding appropriately. Li Xun and FA Xiang have known each other for a long time, but they are quite happy to meet each other. They are just talking and laughing, but his eyes sometimes take a look at Lu Xueqi sitting beside FA Xiang.</p>
<p>The superior officer planned to see all this in his eyes. At this time, when people saw him enter the hall, they all stood up one by one. Shangguance smiled back, went to the seat, and looked at Lu Xueqi and FA.</p>
<p>The two men saluted him at the same time. Lu Xueqi was still silent, while FA Xiang said with a smile: &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen him for many years. It&rsquo;s really rare that my uncle is in good health.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shangguan CE shook his head and said with a smile, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m old, I&rsquo;m old, and I&rsquo;m useless.&rdquo; Then he reached out and asked them to sit down.</p>
<p>In his mind, he turned around. Over the years, the fame of FA Xiang between Tianyin temple and the world&rsquo;s right path has soared. All parties believe that he is the next successor of Tianyin temple, so it&rsquo;s not surprising that he came here on behalf of master Puhong of Tianyin temple.</p>
<p>However, in Qingyun Mountain, it seems that Xiao Yicai, a disciple of changmen, is the most valued young disciple by immortal daoxuan. Of course, Lu Xueqi has been very dazzling and powerful in recent years. In addition, she is extremely beautiful, which is enjoyed by people all over the world.</p>
<p>Shangguance&rsquo;s mind turned and secretly guessed that Lu Xueqi was coming from Qingyun school. He had no other intention, but naturally he would not show it. Everything was as usual and he smiled and said to all the people: &ldquo;everyone, shangguance, I&rsquo;m very grateful to all of you for your concern about despicable valley. The volcano erupted some days ago, which is indeed the normal change of heaven and earth. Thanks to you, despicable Valley has not yet What damage. &quot;</p>
<p>Dharma phase smiled and said: &ldquo;Amitabha, this is the best. However, it is said that there is something wrong with the old master Yun Yi Lanyun, the leader of the burning incense valley. My mentor, master Puhong, has always made friends with him, so he asked me to greet him for his old man. &quot;</p>
<p>When he said this, he said the thoughts of most people in the audience. After all, the movement of burning incense Valley is strange. Especially when such a big thing happened, the valley leader Yun Yilan never showed up, which is really strange.</p>
<p>At that time, everyone agreed. All eyes are focused on the superior officer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In fact, I just came from the valley master&rsquo;s residence, tianxiangju,&rdquo; said the superior officer with a smile</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s voice of &ldquo;ah&rdquo; and &ldquo;Oh&rdquo; suddenly came out, and the sound became a piece. The superior officer decided to treat everyone with a little peace. He stood up, bowed his hand to all the people, and said with a smile, &ldquo;you care about beauty. I have reported to the valley master one by one. The valley master is very grateful. It&rsquo;s just that elder martial Brother Yun is really in a critical moment. If you don&rsquo;t come out to see the guests, I&rsquo;d like to ask you to forgive me for being rude. &quot;</p>
<p>After that, he smiled and hugged his fists. Li Xun, who was beside him, also stood up and saluted with him.</p>
<p>Everyone looked at each other. After a while, FA Xiang stood up, smiled and said, &ldquo;since the almsgiver said so.</p>
<p>I think elder Yun must be in good health, so we can rest assured. This is a real interruption. &quot;</p>
<p>At the same time, shangguance and Li Xun said: &ldquo;where, where.&rdquo;</p>
<p>FA Xiangxiang looks at Lu Xueqi, but sees the woman&rsquo;s expressionless face, which is almost as cold as ice, especially the face, which is almost pale as transparent, with a trace of bleakness.</p>
<p>FA Xiang smiled bitterly in his heart. Knowing that Lu Xueqi would not speak on his own initiative, he had to say Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s share for her. &ldquo;Master Yun is in good health, that&rsquo;s the best. In addition, senior brother Li Xun just said that it seems that there are demons of demon sect playing tricks in disorder this time. Don&rsquo;t you know where we can help? &quot;</p>
<p>The superior officer thought for a while and said: &ldquo;the devil cult demon is full of tricks. I love falling into the well and falling into the stone. I secretly attack despicable valley when the natural disaster happens. It&rsquo;s really hateful. It&rsquo;s just a good thing that we defended well and drove them out of the valley. Although we can&rsquo;t give up this matter, we can&rsquo;t find them for a while now. Incense Valley sent many disciples. To this day, except for some small people, only martial nephew Li Xun and Miss Lu Xueqi tracked down the Golden Vase of the joy sect of the demon sect last night. Unfortunately, they let her run away. Now I don&rsquo;t know how to trace it. &quot;</p>
<p>FA Xiang frowns, and other people are speechless. Moreover, the demon sect is very powerful now. Jin Pinger is a famous hot woman in the world. Some people who are low in Taoism may not want to provoke her.</p>
<p>However, for various reasons, they do not want other factions to join in.</p>
<p>At present, the superior officer made a look at Li Xun. Li Xun understood, stepped forward and said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here to thank you for your kindness, but the burning incense Valley tries its best. Although it takes time, it also needs to trace this matter, so don&rsquo;t bother you&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly, a cold word came from him.</p>
<p>Everyone was stunned. Looking back, it was Lu Xueqi, the ice woman who had been silent.</p>
<p>In the eyes of people all over the world, this cold and clear woman has a frosty face, but in her cold eyes, there is a faint flow of light at the moment, and she doesn&rsquo;t know what she is thinking?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those demons and demons,&rdquo; her voice echoed in people&rsquo;s ears, &ldquo;mostly went to a place called qilitong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Other people immediately began to talk about it. Only when Li Xun was shocked and looked at Lu Xueqi, he suddenly had a different look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last night, when we were fighting with the demons, elder martial brother Li Xun and I heard that jinpinger was right&hellip;&rdquo; Her voice said here, pausing for a while, then returning to normal, saying: &ldquo;to the ghost of the devil Kingdom, she said&rdquo; qilitong &quot;</p>
<p>Shangguan CE frowned and looked at Li Xun. He didn&rsquo;t tell himself the news somehow.</p>
<p>On the main hall, everyone&rsquo;s eyes fell on the burning incense Valley and others for a moment. The superior officer thought it would turn, and then smiled: &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect Miss Lu to have a clue. In this case, despicable Valley immediately sent someone to investigate. As for the same way, you don&rsquo;t have to go. After all, this is South Xinjiang. You just came to greet our valley master. So you have the heart, the heart of despicable valley. &quot;</p>
<p>Everyone promised.</p>
<p>Li Xun stands quietly behind shangguance and looks at Lu Xueqi in the crowd. Last night, he followed jinpinger, who was not inferior to him in Taoism. Secondly, jinpinger was always deceitful and tricky, and finally got rid of him. When he was angry, he remembered that Lu Xueqi was still in the waste village of Tianshui and confronted with the ghost of the ghost King sect of the demon sect, and hurried back.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, halfway up the road, he met Lu Xueqi, who came back from driving the sword. After meeting him, he was shocked. At that time, Lu Xueqi seemed to have lost his soul. His face was pale without a trace of blood. His white clothes were a little red, which was the trace of blood.</p>
<p>He panicked and shouted, which seemed to call Lu Xueqi back from the strange mood, but he just looked at him in silence and went straight back to the burning incense valley.</p>
<p>What happened to this cold woman and the ghost who had been with her in the deserted Tianshui mountain stronghold?</p>
<p>Is it an exciting fight? Talk?</p>
<p>Somehow, once Li Xun thought of this place, he was filled with inexplicable anger.</p>
<p>His complexion is complicated with his mind, and all of these have not escaped the eyes of the superior official policy and the Dharma phase.</p>
<p>Just, these two people, but also did not say a word, with a smile, talk is happy.</p>
<p>Finally, all the members of the sect who decide other greetings turn around. Because of the deep connection with the burning Valley, and the news is still provided by Lu Xueqi, Lu Xueqi and FA Xiang will stay and go to qilidong with the people sent by burning Valley to have a good look.</p>
<p>And almost at the same time, ghost and small white with small ash, appeared in front of Matou Mountain.</p>
<p>Looking at this horse head like mountain, Xiaobai smiled and said: &ldquo;it is said that there is a deep hole in the mountain, where there is the dog God believed by Miao people. There is a narrow mountain path at the foot of the mountain. Only one person is allowed to walk and enter, which is the seven Li cave where Miao people live together. &quot;</p>
<p>Ghost Li face expressionless ground looked to this mountain in front of, a word also don&rsquo;t say, walk forward silently. He hasn&rsquo;t said a word since last night.</p>
<p>Xiaobai stood at the back and looked at his back, but there was a faint smile on the corner of his mouth. He turned his head and patted the little gray lying on his shoulder. He smiled and said, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p>
