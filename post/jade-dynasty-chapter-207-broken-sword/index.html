      <p>Zhongtu, outside Heyang City, abandoned village.</p>
<p>This mysterious figure broke through the magic of Monday immortal in one fell swoop, and awed the whole audience with his overwhelming and unfathomable Taoist behavior. He even saw through the escape skill of his family. However, in his speech and behavior, he did not deny the mysterious connection with Qingyun gate. In addition, he was incredibly high in Taiji Xuanqing Taoism. The origin of this mysterious figure is unimaginable.</p>
<p>However, with the shadow of the wild fairy and the evil spirit of the dog, there was no thought of the evil man. After breaking the magic method of Monday, the man&rsquo;s body hidden behind the shadow seemed to be suddenly stimulated. He began to breathe slowly, and his breath became heavy.</p>
<p>Zhou Yixian frowned tightly, staring at the figure. There was not much fear in his eyes, but more doubts. With the high level of Tao that the mysterious man just showed, it is impossible for him to gasp after just a few strokes. Obviously, there seems to be hidden diseases or some strange symptoms in this human body, and even such high-level figures as him can hardly control themselves.</p>
<p>However, in spite of this, on the outside, the mysterious figure shows no sign of weakening. On the contrary, with the rising of ferocity, the pure and gentle breath of Taiji Xuanqing road has been depressed, and the murderous spirit and pressure that come from it are more than that. At this time, anyone who faces that pair of black gas gradually lights up, flashing fierce dark red eyes, will understand what this mysterious figure is going to do next!</p>
<p>As soon as Monday immortal bit his teeth, he seemed to have made up his mind to pull the Taoist priest and the little ring behind him. When he reached out, he was pulled over, but the little ring was empty.</p>
<p>Monday fairy was surprised and didn&rsquo;t wait for him to look back. But only saw the figure flash, the small ring actually was already standing in front of him, facing that mysterious person.</p>
<p>Zhou Xian was stunned, but he only heard Xiaohuan say in a hurry: &ldquo;grandfather. You go, I&rsquo;ll stop him. &quot;</p>
<p>On Monday, the immortal said angrily, &ldquo;what do you know? This man&rsquo;s Tao is very important. Quick&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The word &ldquo;come back&rdquo; has not yet been exported, but Xiaohuan has already started.</p>
<p>Facing the mysterious man.</p>
<p>The beautiful and pure girl&rsquo;s hands suddenly raised, and a black book with no word cover flashed through her hands. A moment later, the seven mysterious &ldquo;blood jade bone pieces&rdquo; that Mr. ghost had given her appeared in her hand.</p>
<p>A dark breath, invisible but seemingly qualitative, suddenly came out of thin air and fell in the abandoned courtyard. Monday fairy was stunned and stopped. Even the mysterious man who was approaching in front of him also gave a light &ldquo;eh&rdquo;. Stopped.</p>
<p>Different from that mysterious man&rsquo;s ferocious breath, but also contains the strange dark breath of the forest ghost gas, from all directions. This place was originally a Yizhuang, and its Yin Qi was very heavy. This time, the little ring played a strange trick of ghost. At that time, the ghost roared continuously, and the Yin wind was as miserable as the howling of thousands of ghosts, which made people feel embarrassed.</p>
<p>Seven pieces of blood jade bone pieces, slowly floating in the heart of small ring hand. Like the invisible hand control, a triangle shape is arranged in the middle of the air in front of the small ring body, and the dark red light is slowly shining on the bloody places on each piece. Such as seven slowly opened eyes, staring at the mysterious figure.</p>
<p>The mysterious man&rsquo;s clothes were also ringing in the dark wind all over the yard, but he didn&rsquo;t seem to be bewildered by these ghosts. His eyes, which were hidden behind the shadow of the black air, narrowed slightly. Suddenly, he said in a cold voice, &ldquo;the art of ghost road!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little ring frowned slightly. The original beautiful face looks pale at the moment. I don&rsquo;t know whether it is because she is not proficient in performing such miracles for the first time, or is it that girls are naturally disgusted and afraid of ghosts and ghosts. In any case, the ghost magic that she performed for the first time has been shaped through the catalysis of the ghost treasure &ldquo;blood jade bone piece&rdquo;. A deep black air gradually condenses around her body. And between her arms turning, it is a huge black skull that is incompatible with her image. It is extremely weird.</p>
<p>At the same time, seven pieces of blood jade bone pieces also slowly ascended into the sky, inlaid into the eyes of the two skeletons transformed by the black gas. In an instant, the skeleton was reborn, the red light in his eyes was great, he opened his mouth, and the wind from the place where the wind arose was like thunder. A black air shot out of its mouth like a sharp arrow and shot at the mysterious man.</p>
<p>The sound of breaking the sky, such as the sound of dysprosia, was in front of the mysterious man in a twinkling of an eye.</p>
<p>The figure of the mysterious man turned around, seemingly slow, but at the moment when it was impossible to send, he hid the fierce arrow of ghost Qi. The ghost arrow broke through the air, and the sound of agitation was still in the ear.</p>
<p>However, he was not allowed to breathe. From the mouth of the black skeleton in front of him, black fierce ghost arrows shot out one after another, piercing through the air and howling, shooting directly at the mysterious figure, and the direction was slightly different, both up and down, left and right, and there was no room left.</p>
<p>Standing behind Xiaohuan, both Zhouxian and daoren yegou changed their faces. The difference was that Taoist yegou was surprised and pleased, and had never thought that Xiaohuan daoshu was so powerful. However, Monday immortal&rsquo;s facial expression was much more complicated, and his face was not a little happy, but more worried and suspicious.</p>
<p>It was at this time that Monday fairy suddenly looked on his face and stepped back, but he looked at the other direction in the yard. It is not the place where Xiaohuan fights with the mysterious figure. On the contrary, it is a place that no one has noticed. They have just explored the abandoned house of Yizhuang.</p>
<p>There was a deep shadow, but it seemed better than the ghost in the courtyard at the moment. Just Monday, the immortal and the wild dog Taoist priest looked inside at the door. Naturally, there was nothing left inside, except the residual broken tiles and gravel, as well as a few uncomfortable old coffins.</p>
<p>But it is these, but suddenly attracted the attention of Monday immortal in the past, and even the small ring in the fight he did not pay attention to for a while.</p>
<p>In that abandoned house, but what things appeared?</p>
<p>Monday fairy was staring at it without blinking.</p>
<p>In the courtyard, Xiaohuan&rsquo;s ghost magic was so powerful that it completely overwhelmed the mysterious figure on the scene for a moment. She watched the black skeleton she summoned constantly send out the most ferocious ghost arrows, one by one, shooting through the air. Although none of them could hit the mysterious man, it also forced the mysterious man to keep dodging. This dark and weird ghost power, even that A mysterious man with profound Taoism is not willing to direct his front.</p>
<p>However, after a long time like this, although the black skeleton covered by Xiaohuan&rsquo;s body was still frozen. And the red light in his eyes was also bright, but the mysterious man had changed. He seemed to have seen something and sneered. Suddenly in the sky Ghost arrow such as rain, deceiving the body to fly, straight to the small ring.</p>
<p>All the ghost arrows seemed to have lost their accuracy for a moment, and slid away from him, with a roar of aggression.</p>
<p>But they all flew to the side. The face of the wild dog Taoist priest and other people were all pale. Seeing that the black figure was about to fly close to her body, her hands suddenly closed and put them on her chest. Suddenly, under the urging of her technique, the black skeleton screamed and suddenly became about half smaller, but it also blocked the small ring. The seven pieces of blood jade bone flashing red light whirled rapidly. In the eyes of the black skeleton, a red light curtain suddenly spilled out, blocking the origin of the mysterious figure.</p>
<p>The mysterious man snorted. It seemed that he had some taboo to the red light curtain, and stopped.</p>
<p>On the contrary, although Xiaohuan is out of danger for a while, but then I don&rsquo;t know why, the whole body trembles. It seems that all of a sudden, there is a black flash on his face. A moment later, her hands and the black skeleton in front of her began to tremble slightly.</p>
<p>Even the ghost arrow she controls. At the same time, he was also affected immediately, from the roaring and unstoppable momentum just now, to the feeble appearance. And the red light curtain shed by Xiaohuan&rsquo;s method was finally shaking in Xiaohuan&rsquo;s struggling expression. At last it dissipated.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the mysterious man did not attack again after the sudden decline of Xiaohuan. Instead, he stood up and looked at the girl who was gradually weakening. His eyes flashed with a cold light.</p>
<p>The wild dog Taoist priest was in a great hurry. He didn&rsquo;t know that Xiaohuan had a good advantage at the moment. He suddenly seemed to be defeated and quickly stepped forward to hold the faltering ring. At the beginning, he was shocked. Xiaohuan&rsquo;s body was extremely cold. There was a strange and unpredictable ghost spirit in the cold, which was sent out, and he wanted to choose someone to eat.</p>
<p>Fortunately, this feeling soon dissipated with Xiao Huan&rsquo;s inability to sit down. The wild dog Taoist did not dare to neglect him, so he helped Xiao Huan to sit down slowly. Monday fairy went to Xiaohuan in silence, looked at her face carefully, shook her head and sighed, did not speak.</p>
<p>Small ring at the moment to see the extreme weakness, it seems that even words can not speak. In the middle of the sky, the black skeleton gradually faded, and finally disappeared, leaving only seven pieces of blood jade bone that turned back to ordinary. They coagulated a little from the air, then fell down and landed on the stone slab in front of the small ring, making a few crisp sounds.</p>
<p>The mysterious man looked at the little ring and suddenly said, &ldquo;how long has she practiced the art of&rdquo; blood soul &quot;</p>
<p>Monday fairy walked slowly to Xiaohuan, blocking the mysterious man&rsquo;s view of Xiaohuan. The mysterious man looked at him, and said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s only a month.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mysterious man was silent for a moment. The two red lights in his eyes were dim and dim. With the weakening of those two red lights, his whole person seemed to have a little more human flavor, and his ferocity was much lighter.</p>
<p>Zhou Yixian frowned. He traveled from place to place to see and experience. Few people in the world could compare with him. Naturally, he could see the strangeness in the mysterious man. His eyes gradually showed the color of thinking. Then he seemed to think of something. Suddenly, he looked at the abandoned room again.</p>
<p>In the cold night wind, the deserted house stands alone, dilapidated and desolate. There is no difference at all, but the expression of Monday immortal looking at it is very strange, and there is still some expectation.</p>
<p>The mysterious man was silent for a while, and his voice was still so flat. But looking at the line of sight behind Monday immortal, he already had some unexpected appreciation and said: &ldquo;good talent! But it&rsquo;s a pity that it&rsquo;s used in the ghost art. &quot;</p>
<p>Monday fairy turned to look at him and said, &ldquo;my dear, we have no intention of offending you. We did not mean to intrude into this place tonight, nor did we want to have any conflict with you. If there is nothing else, please let the three of us go. &quot;</p>
<p>The mysterious man&rsquo;s eyes slowly drew back, looked at Monday immortal, and sneered and said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s easy for you to enter here by mistake. Who knows you&rsquo;re not&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the middle of it, all of a sudden. However, the man&rsquo;s body was slightly shaken, and his words were interrupted. Zhou Yixian was shocked, and then clearly saw the black face. In the eye socket two red light, is slowly light up.</p>
<p>The ferocity and cruelty came back again, and invisibly shrouded everything. It was more powerful than just now.</p>
<p>Zhou Yixian&rsquo;s face changed greatly. He suddenly stepped back, pulled up the weak ring, and said to the astonished wild dog Taoist, &ldquo;quick, quick, separate, and escape one by one&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wild dog Taoist priest seems to have understood something, but before he can speak, the darkness in front of him suddenly coagulates, and the overcast wind is strong. A huge shadow suddenly covers the three of them from the sky. There is no way to go.</p>
<p>The wild dog Taoist roared, and the whole man jumped up and pressed the small ring under his body to block the shadow with his body. On Monday, the immortal was stunned for a while, and the complicated expression on his old face changed again and again. But in a moment, the powerful darkness fell into the world like a curtain of heaven. The heavy and powerful force was irresistible, and it suddenly covered it, like a towering mountain. It seems that the three people will be pressed into powder.</p>
<p>At the moment of the flash of life and death, a red light flashed in the abandoned house, as if someone was roaring fiercely in the dark. The light suddenly soared, as if suppressed for a long time of anger, suddenly pierced the darkness, turned into a huge column of light, burst out from the darkness of the abandoned house.</p>
<p>Then came a roar like thunder. The whole abandoned house was split into pieces by a strong shock, and countless pieces of broken soil and debris were shot into the sky in the huge roar, glowing red like flames. A figure in the form of a dragon, across the dark void, with the momentum of thundering, shot at the mysterious man.</p>
<p>Zhou Yixian, Xiaohuan and daoren dingou are about to be crushed to pieces. All of a sudden, Zhou Yixian, Xiaohuan, and daoren dingou are about to be crushed to pieces. Suddenly, they take back the water like a long whale. The huge pressure suddenly disappears. All of them can&rsquo;t help but feel the whirling of the earth and dizzy in their minds.</p>
<p>In the distance, facing the bright figure, the mysterious figure seemed to be very angry. The blood red color in his eyes was even more serious. Suddenly, both hands were together to block in front of him, and instantly formed a wall of black shadow, which resisted the red light.</p>
<p>Under the fierce fighting between the two sides, at the junction of red light and black shadow, if the light and shadow turned white and hot, they kept making a strange whistling sound. From a distance, the surrounding scenery began to vaporize, and the heat wave began to roll, and gradually floated up into the sky.</p>
<p>At the moment, their two mysterious figures are no longer visible.</p>
<p>On such a quiet night, such a deserted villa, there are such profound figures of Taoism, who are fighting to death here!</p>
<p>Suddenly, the deepest part of the light, burst out a huge noise, such as the sky thunder suddenly exploded. In an instant, a huge strong wind came to my face, and the sand and dust were rolling on all sides. All the objects were shot out. Even the bodies of the three people, including Zhouxian, could not help but tumble and float out.</p>
<p>Among the thunder, there was a voice roaring like thunder: &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t turn back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Answer that voice, is a sneer, contains endless disdain and arrogance.</p>
<p>Light and shadow swaying, finally slowly dim, dissipated away, a big pit, Huoran appeared between the sand and dust. Standing in the pit, two people confront each other. One is Zhouxian, who has never been seen before. He is short and plump, full of anger, holding a red fairy sword. He is awe inspiring, but I don&rsquo;t know if he is hurt. There are bloodstains on the corner of his mouth. The other one looks at his clothes and clothes, which is just the mysterious figure they were fighting against, but the black air envelops him at the moment I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s because the fighting with this short and fat character is too fierce to maintain.</p>
<p>From a distance, the mysterious man, dressed in Qingyun gate Taoist robe, has a clear face and five long whiskers. It gives people the first impression that he is a man of noble virtue and extraordinary appearance. At the moment, the cold light and red light in his eyes are shining, but it adds a bit of strangeness.</p>
<p>The short and fat man took a look at Zhouxian and others. It seemed that they were not in danger of their lives for the time being. Then he showed a more reassuring look, and then his expression turned grim, staring at the Taoist.</p>
<p>After a long time, the fat man sneered and said in a cold voice, &ldquo;do you think you can trap me with this skill of&rdquo; killing the heart lock &quot;</p>
<p>In the eyes of the Taoist priest, the red light twinkled, and the ferocity and ferocity of his body were extremely strong. He kept stretching and puffing, and said darkly: &ldquo;I forget that this Taoist technique was created by your ancestor, but it&rsquo;s not good to use it on you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bah,&rdquo; the fat man said, &ldquo;if you fall into the devil&rsquo;s way, you dare to talk nonsense. Zhuxinlock has long been banned by the ancestors of all ages. Now you ignore the ancestral precepts. Do you still have the ancestors of Qingyun gate in your eyes? &quot;</p>
<p>The Taoist priest sneered and said, &ldquo;I am not the only one who contributed to the destruction of the ancestral temple when you fought with me that day. Do you still have the ancestors of Qingyun gate in your eyes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fat man was suffocating, but then he was even more angry. He didn&rsquo;t know what to say for a moment, but glared at the Taoist.</p>
<p>The Taoist looked at the fat man and sneered, &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;d better not be brave! Although your Taoist practice is more profound than I thought, you can break the heart lock, but in order to save the three people, you have to spend your practice to break through. At the moment, your qi and blood are flowing back, and your qi and blood are shaking together. At most, there is only 60% of the ordinary Taoist practice left.</p>
<p>Hey, hey&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>He sneered bitterly and said, &ldquo;when you were in full bloom, you were not my opponent. You were captured and imprisoned in this abandoned coffin. Do you dare to be enemies with me now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, the fat man didn&rsquo;t have the slightest fear to flinch. He said: &ldquo;in those days, you and elder martial brother Wan were extremely elegant. After I followed you, I died for you, and I didn&rsquo;t have the slightest regret. But today you are not the person of that year, and what I did is exactly what you and elder martial brother Wan did when they died at the age of nine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He screamed, with a little fortitude on his face, but a little bit deeply sad. He cried, &ldquo;take the sword!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before a word is said, the figure is like electricity, and instantly melts into the red light, like a giant dragon flying into the sky and pouncing on it. The Taoist&rsquo;s eyes were full of red light, but his pupils contracted slightly. Seeing the red light column&rsquo;s momentum, it seemed to cut through the sky and the heaven and earth, almost irresistible, leaving only the road of the same fate.</p>
<p>However, he suddenly sneered. A cold light suddenly appeared at the waving place of his right hand. There was not much dazzling light, but he blocked the direction of the red light column in front of him.</p>
<p>When the cold light came into contact with the red light column, it suddenly flashed brilliance. It seemed that it had no front and was slow. It was actually cut into it, and a flash of light was shining and shaking.</p>
<p>The fat man suddenly roared, and then a cry of pain. Suddenly, the red light turned back and scattered. The fat man staggered out and fell on the ground. He couldn&rsquo;t stand on the ground. He retreated one after another. In the process of retrogression, his mouth was already gushing with blood. Obviously, he was seriously injured. Even his clothes and chest were stained with blood.</p>
<p>At the Taoist priest&rsquo;s place, the cold light flashed away and he could see that he was holding a plain ancient sword. The ancient sword had a primitive form and a strange material. The strangest thing was that the ancient sword was a broken sword, which was broken two feet in front of him.</p>
<p>The fat man&rsquo;s blood flowed out of his mouth. He glared at the Taoist and hissed: &ldquo;you How dare you take Zhuxian sword down to Qingyun Mountain? &quot;</p>
<p>The Taoist priest looked up at the sky and laughed wildly. In the distance, on Monday, the three fairies were more and more surprised. At the end of the day, they were even more shocked in their minds!</p>
<p>Zhuxian ancient sword!</p>
<p>Is the broken sword in the Taoist&rsquo;s hand actually the most famous sword in the immortal family? The ancient sword of Zhuxian?</p>
<p>So what are these two people who are so high in morality that they are terrible? (to be continued. )</p>
