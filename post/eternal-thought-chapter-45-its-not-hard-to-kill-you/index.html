      <p>Bai Xiaochun is short of breath. He has already forgotten himself. He has not considered his success several times, nor paid attention to the result of this assessment. His eyes are full of bloodshot. At the moment, there is only one thing he can think about, that is, how to make himself fully confident when he turns on the furnace next time.</p>
<p>If you are not sure, never open the furnace!</p>
<p>He likes a stable personality, in refining medicine, play to the extreme.</p>
<p>However, he found that no matter how he tried to solve the problem, he could not solve the problem unless he could fix the ink element in the fruit. In this way, although it was not a change in the prescription, it was also a subtle adjustment. Bai Xiaochun was silent for a moment and his eyes showed determination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can only jump out of the prescription, to adjust according to the need!&rdquo; He crushed the fruit in his hand.</p>
<p>With a click, countless juices fell, but they did not fall into the furnace. Instead, they were condensed in the air. Under the control of Bai Xiaochun, according to the degree of richness he needed, they were constantly fused together.</p>
<p>In this scene, others did not feel anything, just surprised. Even Bai Xiaochun didn&rsquo;t feel anything strange. He just felt that it would be safe to do so. That&rsquo;s why.</p>
<p>However, elder Xu opened his eyes suddenly. For the first time, he was shocked. Even if Bai Xiaochun had succeeded seven times before, he was just surprised. But now, this kind of shock is more than before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bai Xiaochun, he even tried to adjust the prescription. This son is not so popular. No wonder Palmer asked me to pay attention to this son before going out last month.&rdquo; Elder Xu was thinking.</p>
<p>A moment later, Bai Xiaochun waved her right hand violently. After driving away the extra ink, she left only the size of her fingernail and threw it into the furnace. Then she took out other herbs and put them in one by one and opened the eighth furnace!</p>
<p>The furnace turned red to the naked eye, and it didn&rsquo;t even take an hour, that is, about two incense sticks. When the whole body of the furnace was shaken, and the medicine incense suddenly dispersed, the eighth furnace was successful!</p>
<p>Elder Xu looked into the furnace and immediately saw a piece of ten inch size Ink Lingxiang, color black with purple!</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s close to the middle class!&rdquo; Elder Xu&rsquo;s eyes show strange things.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun also saw the difference of this time&rsquo;s refining ink spirit fragrance. He was in a trance. At this moment, he suddenly understood why all the miraculous medicines he had refined before were inferior.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The prescription is not fixed Only by refining according to one&rsquo;s own needs can it be possible to refine The elixir of medium quality or above Bai Xiaochun suddenly had a sense of sudden relief and was quite excited. Before the people around him rose again, he opened the ninth furnace between waves!</p>
<p>At this moment, people around him were breathless, and everyone was no longer talking. They were completely shocked. Although they had some expectations, when they saw Bai Xiaochun succeed eight times in a row, everyone felt unbelievable.</p>
<p>This not only surpasses Zhou Xinqi, but also is not equal to Wang Qingshan, who is now a disciple of inheritance!</p>
<p>Before the people around him recovered from the shock, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s speed of refining medicine was faster. It took only one stick of incense to make the furnace vibrate and the aroma became more fierce. The ninth furnace Success again!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never before!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one has ever called nine times, especially when it&rsquo;s still Mo Lingxiang. Although Bai Xiaochun has been thinking for a long time, he can But his success rate is just as shocking! &quot;</p>
<p>Xu Baocai&rsquo;s mind was buzzing, and he was completely stunned. Du Lingfei only felt that there was an endless wave in his mind. He couldn&rsquo;t help thinking of the scene when Xiaobi was married.</p>
<p>Han Jianye is relieved. Although there is bitterness, he is no longer crazy. If Bai Xiaochun is only a little more than him, he will be more serious. But now, he has taken</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the last time, elder martial brother Bai has created an unprecedented one. Can he Create a miracle</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s worth it this time, even if I&rsquo;ve been here for several days, it&rsquo;s worth it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the people here, at this moment, all pay attention to Bai Xiaochun. Their breathing is heavy and their eyes are full of strong expectations. Even elder Xu is not able to blink his eyes. His heart is more shocked.</p>
<p>Soon, Bai Xiaochun moved, and his face was dignified. He took out the last piece of material, sorted it out one by one, and put it into the furnace according to different time and collocation. He pinched the formula with both hands to stimulate the ground fire.</p>
<p>As time goes by, there is silence all around. Even people can hear their own heartbeat. In this waiting, after a stick of incense</p>
<p>A fierce roar suddenly came out from the furnace. The fog did not disperse when there was no failure. However, there was no spread of any medicine fragrance, which made people around him raise their hearts one after another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Failed?&rdquo; Xu Baocai felt thirsty.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun was also stunned for a moment. With some conjectures in her heart, her eyes suddenly brightened up.</p>
<p>At this time, all the people around immediately saw that there was color light in the furnace, which was scattered out along the gap. With the appearance of the light, elder Xu rushed forward and looked at the whole body of the furnace, which was purple, only an inch in size. His eyes showed ecstasy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Medium grade!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elder Xu laughs and throws his sleeve. All the furnaces and pockets, as well as the refined ink spirit, are all in his hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this assessment, Bai Xiaochun, Han Jianye, Du Lingfei, Chen Ziang, Zhao Yiduo, and five of you have successfully promoted to the medicine apprentice, Bai Xiaochun First, get 5000 contribution points! &quot;</p>
<p>As soon as he uttered his words, people around him suddenly burst out, and the roar spread all over the place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten times, ten times all succeed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the last time As a medicine apprentice, I can make a good medicine of middle quality</p>
<p>No matter Xu Baocai, Du Lingfei, or Han Jianye, everyone is shocked at the moment.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun is helpless. He has not carefully observed the only Chinese medicine that he has refined. At the moment, elder Xu has taken it away. After standing up, he is very dissatisfied. However, judging from the other party&rsquo;s appearance, he clearly does not give himself the possibility.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun sighed. At the moment, he was exhausted. When he walked down the square, people around him looked at him with enthusiasm and admiration. They could see that Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s success for ten times was by no means a fluke, and that time and time of thinking was not what ordinary people could do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Congratulations to elder martial brother Bai for creating a miracle and achieving unprecedented achievements!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elder martial brother Bai, I admire you, I admire you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elder martial brother Bai, I don&rsquo;t understand some plants here. Can you help me&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun blinked. He was too involved in alchemy just now. Seeing the appearance of all the people, he immediately knew that he had made a big deal of things. However, he found that his classmates around him were so enthusiastic. Bai Xiaochun was moved in his heart and quickly clasped his fists to the people.</p>
<p>The heart is happy, before the little turtle, he did not find the opportunity to be in the limelight, now finally found some feeling of being sought after.</p>
<p>For those female disciples who asked him to help, Bai Xiaochun nodded and agreed without hesitation. She also reminded those who called themselves senior brother Bai that their name was Bai Xiaochun, for fear that others would not know.</p>
<p>Just when he was proud of himself, he saw a young man in the crowd, staring at himself fiercely. Bai Xiaochun recognized that the other party was actually one of Zhou Xinqi&rsquo;s admirers. He immediately looked at him and found that the other side was not good-looking, so he rushed out and left quickly.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun trotted all the way back to her cabin. She felt dizzy. After several days of refining medicine, she lost her mind and fell asleep.</p>
<p>The sleep lasted two days.</p>
<p>In the afternoon of the third day, Bai Xiaochun opened her eyes, feeling tired and dizzy. She remembered that her only piece of Chinese medicine was taken away by elder Xu. Bai Xiaochun sighed and looked at it. She found that she had 5000 contribution points in her identity token. She felt a little comforted.</p>
<p>With her contribution point, Bai Xiaochun was ready to continue refining medicine and practice her immortal longevity work. So she went out and exchanged seven or eight prescriptions in the sect. She chose one of them to replenish her vitality and replaced a large number of herbs.</p>
<p>The process was very fast, but he was terrified. He found that some people along the way looked different after seeing him. There was even a admirer of Zhou Xinqi. After seeing him, he showed a sneer and took out the jade slips as if they were transmitting the sound.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun was nervous. After changing herbs, he didn&rsquo;t go back to the yard. Instead, he went straight to the medicine refining Pavilion. With the rest of his contribution, he directly bought a year&rsquo;s time and went into it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This time, I was careless Hum, when I come out, I won&rsquo;t die when I come out. Iron sheet Dacheng has come to annoy me. I&rsquo;ll pinch one of them, ten of them I&rsquo;ll find the palm seat Bai Xiaochun snorted coldly. In the room of the miraculous medicine Pavilion, he did not go out and began to refine medicine.</p>
<p>He can also guess that in those two days of deep sleep, what happened when he was promoted to be a pharmacist will gradually spread. It can be imagined that it will soon spread to the whole Xiangyun mountain.</p>
<p>In fact, it is true. At the moment, some people suspect that Bai Xiaochun It&rsquo;s the little turtle!</p>
<p>Otherwise, how could it be so ingenious? All the plants, trees, spirits and animals were all successful. Especially, Bai Xiaochun refined the middle-grade products, and he was promoted to refining medicine for ten times, all of which were successful.</p>
<p>Zhou Xinqi&rsquo;s admirers even went out. Even Du Lingfei&rsquo;s admirers joined in. But they didn&rsquo;t expect Bai Xiaochun to be so vigilant that he didn&rsquo;t return to his residence. Instead, he stayed in the medicine refining Pavilion. Especially when they found out that Bai Xiaochun actually bought a year&rsquo;s refining time, everyone was angry.</p>
<p>But they didn&rsquo;t dare to break into the medicine refining Pavilion, and Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s identity made them worry. After all, such a disciple did not dare to take Bai Xiaochun seriously. However, the sect would not be in charge of it after all. After all, their skills were inferior to those of others.</p>
<p>However, there was no other way for them to leave. However, there was a young man with a pockmarked face in the crowd. He looked at the medicine refining pavilion with a cold look at his mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I thought I was hiding here, I could do nothing with you. I just beat my cousin Chen Fei. I bullied my beloved younger martial sister Zhou and my favorite sister Du. Even the younger martial sister Hou whom I recently fell in love with always has you in his mouth. Bai Xiaochun, although you have some talent, it is not difficult for me to kill you!&rdquo; The young man sneers at him. He is the disciple of Qian family, Qian Dajin!</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun is leisurely in the room of the medicine refining Pavilion. Every day, he either practices medicine or practices immortal longevity. As the days go by, his immortal longevity work is making rapid progress.</p>
<p>The skin of the whole body is more tough, and the speed and strength are higher than before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In another two days, my undead iron sheet will be a complete success!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun took a deep breath, and his eyes were full of high spirits.</p>
<p>But in the dusk of this day, suddenly, a blue light flew out of the mission of zongmen and went straight to the elixir Pavilion. In spite of the protection of the attic, he instantly appeared in the room where Bai Xiaochun was.</p>
<p>White small pure one Leng, look carefully, that is a token!</p>
