      <p>In the face of the ghost, although Mr. ghost still did not appear from the coffin, he was obviously more cautious. The ghost fire in the air was silent burning, and gradually became bright and bigger, reflecting the faces around him turning green.</p>
<p>Staring at the dark green light, he stepped on a step without expression. Almost at the moment when the ghost&rsquo;s body was moving, the ghost fire seemed to be stimulated by something, and suddenly it was full of light. However, this time, it was not divided into five parts to make the five-star array. Instead, a group of dark green rose abruptly, bringing a gust of wind, which made the dust fall from the house. Zhou Yixian and other three people were caught off guard and rubbed their eyes one after another.</p>
<p>In this increasingly tense moment, the ghost in the air is so dense that it seems that it is about to launch some mysterious and strange magic method. GUI Li didn&rsquo;t dare to be careless in the face of this mysterious Mr. ghost. He was on guard. Suddenly, his eyebrows raised and his whole body lifted up into the air. Almost at the same time, there was a loud noise from the bottom of the house. The whole room suddenly shook violently, just like the feeling of earth shaking and mountain shaking.</p>
<p>A huge white bone giant arm broke through the stone slab on the ground and hit the place where the ghost stood. The green brick stone slab originally paved on the ground was smashed in a moment, and the debris was flying. At the moment, the whole room was shrouded in a ghost howl, and the ghost was flying in the air. The white bone giant arm seemed to be urged by some mysterious force, and rushed upward to the ghost.</p>
<p>The white shadow of the white bone giant arm was reflected in his eyes. At the moment when he was about to hit himself, his body swayed in mid air and floated out to the right. He dodged in a moment. The white bone giant arm fell heavily and fell to the ground. At the same time, it was a burst of sand and flying stones.</p>
<p>At the moment, the house is full of ghost gas and the wind is fierce. The three men, including Monday immortal, are all leaning against the wall. If you want to leave here, you don&rsquo;t dare to move. Otherwise, you may be injured by white bones in this chaos. But fortunately, it seems that Mr. ghost&rsquo;s attention is focused on the ghost. The three of them hid in the corner beside the table, and the bones did not come to hurt them. But three people in the sand and stone chaos, looking at the shady house room, originally not very spacious place, now suddenly a huge white bone arm. Chasing the ghost, it seems that it is a little crowded.</p>
<p>But it seems that this is not enough. At the moment when the immortal was muttering in his heart, there was a dull cry in the depths of the earth. The voice was a little confused and fierce. For example, the long-term imprisoned soul finally had a chance to breathe and let out his heart.</p>
<p>When the house of hell was shaken, the earth turned over and the stone cracked, and the white bones flashed, a huge arm of white bone stretched out from the ground and hit the ghost fiercely. Ghostly in two white bones between the arms of the figure swing dodge. A pair of eyes were fixed on him, but so far he has not fought back.</p>
<p>The room became more crowded for a moment.</p>
<p>In this dark house, the white bones are dense, dancing in the air, strange and frightening scenes are quietly staged. Although the fighting skills of Mr. ghost and GUI Li are fierce, they both seem to have a tacit understanding. The scope of their magic power is limited in this house, and Mr. ghost&rsquo;s ghost tricks do not overflow outside the house. And GUI Li has been moving in the house.</p>
<p>In the sky above the house, the ghost fire was burning coldly. Under the green light, the bones were flying. GUI Li&rsquo;s figure seems to be gradually with a bit of strange and gloomy gas, but in any case, up to now, Mr. ghost still has no way to deal with it. In the coffin, Mr. ghost&rsquo;s voice snorted coldly.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the ghost fire in the air suddenly lit up. Two huge and flying white bone giant arms suddenly stopped, and then there seemed to be a sad cry, &ldquo;kakakaka&rdquo; harsh sound sounded, the two white bone giant arms actually appeared countless cracks from top to bottom, in a moment, turned into countless pieces, the edge was extremely sharp, like the bone rain all over the sky, and it was like a swarm of biting bees.</p>
<p>Zhou Yixian and other three people look pale, and Xiaohuan is even more startled and yelled. In the small mansion, two giant arms are already the most difficult to avoid. This has turned into a rain of broken bones all over the sky. How can we avoid the past.</p>
<p>His face was as cold as frost. Staring at this piece of bone in the sky, he was about to rush to the front of him. Suddenly, he fell from the air at a high speed and went straight to the ground. He was as fast as lightning. The innumerable pieces of bone in the air gave birth to a suffocation. If they were spiritually, they made a sharp sound in the air. Shengsheng stopped to castrate, took a bend in the air and chased after him.</p>
<p>GUI Li fell to the ground in a twinkling of an eye, but before his body fell steadily, he stretched out his hand on the ground, and his whole body actually flew out close to the ground, and that direction was the coffin where Mr. ghost was.</p>
<p>The ghost fire in the air was shocked, and it fell like lightning, and countless pieces of bones were chasing up in the wind. The wind was blowing, and the whole room was shaking. The ghostly clothes and clothes were blowing in the wind. However, when there was a moment of pursuing soldiers after the interception, he suddenly threw out his magic weapon, the black stick of soul eating, which was so powerful that it was even more magical Among them, the blood sucking beads on the top of the black stick are dark red, and the little bits of blood are all lit up one by one, which is the scene of the peak of Demon power.</p>
<p>However, the direction of the soul swallowing flight is actually the corner where the three people are located. Zhouxian, Xiaohuan and Taoist wild dog haven&rsquo;t responded yet. They only see a black light suddenly rushing in front of them. Before they get close, there is an extremely strange cold breath around them. There is a vague Demon power in the air, which affects the blood essence in the body like a devil, and seems to burst out of the body.</p>
<p>In the twinkling of an eye, the soul swallowing flew to the front of him. With a sharp sound, Sheng Sheng inserted himself into the wall beside the head of Zhouxian and almost completely sank into it.</p>
<p>Monday fairy was so shocked that he even forgot to drink and scold him. In a moment, he felt a chill coming from his head to his feet. The black stick next to his ear seemed to have an invisible arm and wanted to drag himself in. He was frightened and tried to move his body away, and then he gasped.</p>
<p>At this time, the original Flying bones and the ghost fire suddenly stopped and coagulated in the air. A moment later, the wall suddenly uttered a slight pain light hum. Suddenly, a human shaped soil block completely flew out of the wall and rushed to the ghost. However, the original countless pieces of bone seemed to have lost their spiritual power Like, one after another fell to the ground, only that group of ghost fire, but seems to be more bright. Fly back over the block.</p>
<p>With a slight howl of ghost and a move of the right hand, the black stick of soul eating flies back and stabs into the earth from behind. In an instant, it disintegrated, and a black figure flashed out, floating like a ghost, falling on the mysterious coffin deep in the room. It was Mr. ghost&rsquo;s figure.</p>
<p>The soul slowly fell. Back in Gui Li&rsquo;s hand, GUI Li looked at Mr. GUI, but didn&rsquo;t start. Mr. ghost turned slowly and looked at GUI Li. Suddenly he said, &ldquo;how can you see where I am hiding?&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li was silent and did not answer. He just looked at him coldly. Mr. ghost moved his black veil and nodded.</p>
<p>He said, &ldquo;well, you and I may not be friends in the future. Of course, if you don&rsquo;t want to say it, it&rsquo;s just not over today. I&rsquo;d like to see you, the legendary figure who is also the true dharma of the three great sects. What&rsquo;s the practice of Taoism?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pupils of the ghost shriveled slightly. Although he had taken the chance to attack Mr. ghost&rsquo;s hidden place by surprise, he had the upper hand, but his face was not relaxed at all. He stabbed his soul into the earth by means of deliberate calculation. But Mr. ghost was really like a ghost. He was empty and could not see the influence of the blood sucking pearl Demon power on him. He was mysterious. It&rsquo;s really the only one in Gui Li&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>Seeing the confrontation between the two, it seems that there will be a fierce fight again. Monday immortal is slightly shocked. He quickly pulls a small ring and a wild dog Taoist. They wake up and know that there are two people fighting each other. It was extremely dangerous. At present, she was busy looking for a hole in the dilapidated wall and went out. Before leaving, Xiaohuan seemed to remember something again. By the way, he extended his hand and took Zhou Xingyun&rsquo;s spiritual position.</p>
<p>The three of them left the room one after another. Naturally, GUI Li and Mr. GUI were clear, but GUI Li did not respond. Mr. GUI was so hostile that he seemed to ignore them at the moment. Just after they were able to leave, suddenly there was a strong wind in the house. Sha Fei Shi left and Monday Xian stood outside the hole in the wall. They were still pushed a few feet away by the fierce wind.</p>
<p>On Monday, the immortal pulled the little ring back to a distance of three feet. Then she looked back at the room. She could not feel that there were two masters in the room who were fighting fiercely. It seemed that they had always controlled the magic power within the scope of that room. Looking from afar, in addition to the green light at the beginning, this strange light in that room began to flash from time to time, such as gold, red, pale white, blue light and so on. If it was not for the fierce and murderous spirit, it was quite colorful and beautiful.</p>
<p>Xiaohuan stares at the room and whispers to the immortal Monday who seems to be preparing to run away: &ldquo;grandfather, we&rsquo;re just going to leave, isn&rsquo;t it great?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhouxian and the wild dog Taoist who walked beside were both stunned. Turning to look at Xiaohuan, Zhouxian frowned and said, &ldquo;silly girl, what are you thinking about! Those two guys are big killers. It&rsquo;s good that we can escape. What are we doing here? &quot;</p>
<p>Small ring hesitated for a while, way: &ldquo;but, but he is to save us after all, just</p>
<p>…”</p>
<p>The wild dog Taoist looked at her and didn&rsquo;t speak. Monday immortal said impatiently, &ldquo;I said how stupid you are! GUI Li Dao is very high. What&rsquo;s to be afraid of? Besides, they bite dogs. Oh, no, one is called GUI Li and the other is Mr. ghost. It should be said that ghosts beat ghosts. It&rsquo;s none of our business for them to beat ghosts. Let&rsquo;s go, let&rsquo;s go</p>
<p>Then he took Xiao Huan&rsquo;s hand and left. Xiaohuan hesitated for a moment, but he was still pulled away by Monday immortal. The wild dog Taoist turned back and took a look at the strange light shining in the dark house. The light flickered and the wind howled faintly. He looked complicated and speechless in his eyes. He stopped for a moment and turned to chase Zhou Yixian and others.</p>
<p>Half a cup of tea time has passed in the shady house. The house, which was already in a mess, is in a mess. There are broken stone walls everywhere. Even the ground which was originally dilapidated now seems to have been ploughed by cattle after an earthquake. The earth is uneven and the stones are protruding, so there is hardly any place to stand on.</p>
<p>At the same time, both GUI Li and Mr. GUI were floating in the air. They stopped for a moment and looked at each other. They seemed to have a slight gasp. Only the small ash on the ghost&rsquo;s shoulder seemed to be impatient. They opened their mouths in boredom, yawned and stretched.</p>
<p>Mr. ghost suddenly said, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe that you are so quick to enter the country. In the past ten years, you have been able to integrate Taoism, Buddhism and magic into one. It&rsquo;s really not easy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Looking at the mysterious man in black, he said coldly, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect that you didn&rsquo;t come from the demon religion, but from the witchcraft and ghost road in southern Xinjiang.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this point, his eyes suddenly showed a dark red light, staring at Mr. ghost, and his voice became cold. &ldquo;Since you are familiar with the way of ghosts, it&rsquo;s the art of reviving the soul of Biyao. You&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without waiting for him to finish, Mr. ghost has already cut off: &ldquo;you are wrong.</p>
<p>Although I know a little about ghost and strange skills, the method of resurrection is the secret skill of the black witch people in southern Xinjiang. I don&rsquo;t know. Otherwise, I would have saved miss Biyao by my friendship with the ghost king. &quot;</p>
<p>He looked at him coldly. The red light in his eyes flickered, and he seemed to be thinking about whether he could believe Mr. ghost&rsquo;s words. However, Mr. ghost was silent for a moment, and suddenly said, &ldquo;since you are determined to protect these three people tonight, I will let them go once because we are all ghost King families. You and I are not interested in fighting here. It&rsquo;s better to stop here! &quot;</p>
<p>GUI Li sneered in his heart. Now he is not an ignorant boy at the beginning. If his deeds are not enough or he is not careful. He had already died countless times. At that time, no one would have said anything that was the same as that of the ghost King clan. However, Mr. GUI is really a mysterious figure. Although he is not afraid of him, GUI Li knows that he is very difficult to deal with in a fight just now. He nodded his head and said calmly: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s OK.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost fell slowly, and the house was in a mess. Most of the original coffins were fragmented, but the coffin on the shady ground was still intact. Mr. ghost fell on it and was silent for a moment. &ldquo;What do you want to do when you come to Qingyun Mountain</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; he said coldly</p>
<p>Mr. ghost said lightly: &ldquo;the world is in chaos. It is in the troubled times that animal demons are rampant. It is inevitable that the right way and the beast demons will fight in Qingyun, which is such a grand occasion. Why don&rsquo;t I come and see it? &quot;</p>
<p>He looked at him fiercely and said, &ldquo;as you said, who can win the right way or the beast demon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. GUI&rsquo;s eyes flashed suddenly, and he seemed to think of something. He said: &ldquo;the strength of the beast demon is beyond the expectation of all people in the world. In particular, no one has ever seen the beast God as the leader, and I don&rsquo;t know what his Taoism is like. However, if he can control these numerous demon demons with high power, he must be a world shaking figure. In this war, I&rsquo;m afraid that the beast demon will win 70%</p>
<p>GUI Li&rsquo;s pupil contracted slightly and remained silent for a long time. He said, &ldquo;is it true that 30% of the right way is above the killing immortal sword array?&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a smile, Mr. ghost said, &ldquo;yes. The sword array of killing immortals in Qingyun gate is really different. It is still the first-class Taoist array in the world for thousands of years. If Zhengdao wants to win this time, I&rsquo;m afraid all hope will be on this sword array. Otherwise, there won&rsquo;t be so many righteous figures. If we don&rsquo;t go to other places, they will all come to Qingyun Mountain. &quot;</p>
<p>He looked up in silence. His face was complicated. He seemed to think of some past events. His face was a little painful.</p>
<p>Mr. ghost looked at his expression in his eyes and suddenly said, &ldquo;although you were born in Qingyun in the early years, there are some secret clouds. I&rsquo;m afraid you don&rsquo;t know it yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned his eyes and looked at Mr. ghost. It seemed that he wanted to see the man thoroughly. After a long time, he slowly said &ldquo;please!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. GUI took a look at the ghost with calm meaning, but his expression seemed to have deep meaning. He said: &ldquo;the Qingyun Mountain immortal killing sword array is extremely powerful and can kill demons and demons. It has been the treasure of Qingyun gate for thousands of years. It is said that this sword array was born out of the unknown ancient scroll which was obtained by the founder of Qingyun sect. Qingye was born thousands of years ago. In the thirteen years after the &ldquo;magic moon cave&rdquo; was closed down, his white hair went out of the pass. He built it by himself. He gathered the spiritual power of the seven peaks of Qingyun as an array, and turned the killing Qi of all things in the world into a sword</p>
<p>His voice pauses for a moment, then his voice seems to be a little erratic, but a pair of eyes are firmly fixed on the ghost, and slowly said: &ldquo;and this world shaking array, but it is inseparable from a magic weapon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ancient sword&rdquo; kills the immortal</p>
<p>Mr. ghost nodded and said, &ldquo;exactly! Where did the ancient sword kill the immortal come from? It&rsquo;s always mysterious. I&rsquo;m afraid even those people in Qingyun Mountain can&rsquo;t tell clearly. But one thing can be sure is that the ancient sword of Zhuxian first appeared in the world. It was Qingye who carried the sword in his hand after he left the gate for 13 years. All along, this magic weapon was never kept by the leader of Qingyun, but was placed in the magic moon cave at the back of Qingyun Mountain. &quot;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost stopped and fell into silence for a while. GUI Li looked at him deeply and said slowly, &ldquo;how do you know so much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost shook his hand and said, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t have to worry about me, but what I said to you is true. Therefore, the secret of Qingyun sect&rsquo;s killing immortal sword array is mostly in the magic moon cave which only the leader of Qingyun can enter. &quot; He laughed and said, &ldquo;do you understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li didn&rsquo;t speak, just staring at this person silently. After a long time, he said coldly, &ldquo;who are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost stood with his hand down and said slowly, &ldquo;in short, you remember that I am not your enemy, that is to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at the man for a moment, suddenly turned back, and slowly floated out. When his figure was about to disappear, his voice seemed to come from afar, but it was like the wind, which was not true.</p>
<p>Mr. ghost was alone in the dark, motionless. The ghost fire slowly faded down and finally completely extinguished. The ghost house fell into silence again.</p>
<p>After a while, a low sneer came out of the shadow in the dark. (to be continued. )</p>
