      <p>Qingyun Mountain, Tongtian peak.</p>
<p>Outside the Yuqing hall, there are a large group of people standing closely. Looking at the past, they are all people of the right path, including immortal daoxuan, the leader of Qingyun, and Yun Yilan, the master of Fenxiang valley. Behind the two of them, other well-known figures of Qingyun and Huoxiang are standing here. Judging from the situation, it seems that they are going to meet someone.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know who it is, who has such a big face?</p>
<p>Not to mention those small sects. At the moment, most of the important figures in Qingyun gate and Huoxiang valley are present. Shangguance, Lvshun, and the second generation disciples Li Xun and Yan Hong are standing behind Yun Yilan. Li Xun&rsquo;s face was expressionless, but his complexion was not good-looking, and there were people talking in low voices around him. From time to time, he had a glance at him, which made his face even more ugly.</p>
<p>At the Qingyun gate, Tian Buyi, Zeng Shuchang, master Shuiyue and Qi Hao were all present. Xiao Yicai and other disciples also stood behind daoxuan, but Lu Xueqi, the most outstanding and influential figure in Qingyun gate in recent years, did not see her body. In addition, Lin Jingyu also did not see the figure, I don&rsquo;t know if it is there again.</p>
<p>This day, the sky is clear, the mountain breeze is slowly blowing, giving people a relaxed and happy feeling. If it wasn&rsquo;t for the fact that there are too many enmities and hatred in this earthly world, it would be like a fairyland on earth.</p>
<p>Among the crowd behind, many people were talking in a low voice. Most of them were talking about the biggest catastrophe in the world. Immortal daoxuan, the leader of Qingyun sect, looked dignified and sighed slightly.</p>
<p>His voice was not loud, and most of the people around him didn&rsquo;t notice it. However, Yun Yilan, the owner of the burning incense Valley, who was standing in front of the crowd side by side, heard him. Turning around, he looked at the immortal daoxuan and said in a low voice, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter, elder martial brother daoxuan?&rdquo;? &quot;</p>
<p>Daoxuan gave a bitter smile and shook his head slightly. &ldquo;Do you listen to the whispers of these Taoist friends behind us? Few people are optimistic. &quot;</p>
<p>With a smile, Yun Yilan said, &ldquo;elder martial brother daoxuan, why do you care about them? Although the disaster has already been accomplished. However, we are now the last hope of the world. In the face of such vicious monsters, elder martial brother, as the leader of the world, if you have no confidence.</p>
<p>How can we face the ardent expectations of the common people in the world? &quot;</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan&rsquo;s face changed slightly, and there was a glimmer of light in his eyes. He took a deep look at Yun Yilan, but he was calm. He didn&rsquo;t seem to have anything to say. He then said with a smile, &ldquo;where do you speak, benefactor Yun? How can I be a leader of the world? We are the people of learning Tao. It is natural that we should not stay out of the way. When master Puhong of Tianyin temple comes here, you and I, together with the heroes of the world, will die for the people. It will not be in vain for us to learn Taoism. &quot;</p>
<p>Yun Yilan nodded and said, &ldquo;elder martial brother, you are right. &quot;</p>
<p>But in front of him, the feeling of self-respect and self-respect is not perfect. But they always seem to be unable to see through this person, always feel that this person seems to be unfathomable.</p>
<p>In daoxuan&rsquo;s mind, he wondered whether he wanted to find a chance to try this cloud Yilan and see what kind of abacus he was trying to do. Suddenly, there was a stir in the crowd. Both daoxuan immortal and Yun Yilan were inspired by their spirits. When they looked down the mountain, they saw that they were entangled and floating in the depths of the white clouds in the towering Tongtian peak mountains. Suddenly, the golden light flashed and then grew rapidly. In a moment, it was fast approaching the summit.</p>
<p>I saw the golden light floating, making a golden lotus blossom shape, floating in the clouds, the Sanskrit, reverberating between heaven and earth, all kinds of solemn atmosphere, people suddenly feel awe.</p>
<p>The immortal daoxuan and Yun Yilan greet each other at the same time. The Golden Lotus falls, flickers for a moment, and the golden light disperses. Dozens of Buddhist monks headed by master Puhong of Tianyin temple are shown. The head of the master Pu Hong looks as good as he used to be. He is merciful and peaceful. He has a golden and red Zen robe. His face is solemn. He holds a string of dark sandalwood beads in his hand, and a smile is on his mouth.</p>
<p>Behind him stood Pufang, a tall elder martial brother holding the &ldquo;futu golden bowl&rdquo;. Then there were ten eminent monks and second-generation disciples of Tianyin temple. Among them were the famous Buddhist disciples such as FA Xiang and FA Shan.</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan stepped forward and said with a smile, &ldquo;master Pu Hong, you are here at last. Everyone has been looking forward to it for a long time! &quot;</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong nodded with a smile and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ashamed to have kept you and Taoist master waiting for a long time.</p>
<p>&quot;</p>
<p>At this time, standing beside daoxuan, Yunyi lanlang said with a smile, &ldquo;master, do you still know me? I haven&rsquo;t seen you for many years. Don&rsquo;t forget all your old friends and acquaintances! &quot;</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong looked at Yun Yi Lan, and his expression was obviously stunned. He even restrained his smile for a moment. Then he saw a look of admiration and said, &ldquo;is this benefactor really the old Valley master of Yunyi Lanyun? &quot;</p>
<p>Yun Yilan laughed and saluted, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s me. I&rsquo;ve met the abbot. &quot;</p>
<p>Pu Hong bowed back and said with a smile, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard that the way of burning incense Valley is profound, especially the three Yang realm of burning incense jade book is more magical. Benefactor Yun is determined and gifted. Is it possible that he has reached the level of Yuyang? &quot;</p>
<p>Yun Yilan&rsquo;s face changed slightly, and his heart was shocked. The incense burning Valley Taoist method has always been known as a secret in the right path, far less famous than the two major schools of Qingyun gate and Tianyin temple. When it comes to &ldquo;Taiji Xuanqing Dao&rdquo; or &ldquo;Da Fan Prajna&rdquo;, everyone knows it. However, when he entered the Central Plains, he met the leaders of the two powerful families in China and Turkey. Unexpectedly, both the real daoxuan and the master Puhong saw his own realm of Taoism and Dharma. When he thought about the relationship between them, he could not help but wonder: is there a traitor in our family who can&rsquo;t work hard?</p>
<p>He just wanted to return, but he still had a good face and said with a smile, &ldquo;master&rsquo;s insight is like a torch. I&rsquo;m a little bit of a little bit of Taoism. It&rsquo;s not worth mentioning! &ldquo;After a pause, Yun Yi Lan&rsquo;s face was slightly serious and said,&rdquo; but since the master is here, that&rsquo;s fine. Nowadays, the world is suffering a lot, and demons are rampant. It&rsquo;s really a disaster that has never happened before. I hope that the master can lead the right way in the world. In addition to this disaster, there is nothing so good about it. &quot;</p>
<p>Taoist immortal stood aside, his face suddenly changed slightly.</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong humbly said, &ldquo;benefactor Yun, where are the people in the world being robbed and the beasts and demons are rampant. Since the Tianyin temple is a Buddhist, how can they retreat behind others? But now the world is full of righteous principles and green clouds. Elder martial brother daoxuan has always been highly respected, and Taoism has even more supernatural powers. Naturally, we should take elder martial brother daoxuan as the leader to lead the world to fight against the powerful enemies. &quot;</p>
<p>Taoist priest said with a smile, &ldquo;master, you are so polite. Daoxuan really doesn&rsquo;t deserve it. &quot;</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong said, &ldquo;master daoxuan, people all over the world look forward to it day and night. If you want to go to this disaster as soon as possible, you must not refuse. &quot;</p>
<p>With a smile, Yun Yi Lan said, &ldquo;both of you are masters of Tao, but there are so many polite words. Come here.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go in and talk. Otherwise, if we let these fellow Taoist friends accompany the three of us to talk, we will not neglect others! &quot;</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan and master Puhong looked at each other and laughed. They walked together. Along the way, people kept saying hello to master Puhong and a group of Tianyin Temple monks. It can be seen that Tianyin Temple enjoys high prestige in the right way.</p>
<p>All the way into the Yuqing palace, master Puhong could not help but praise a few words. The newly built Yuqing hall is magnificent and magnificent. Immortal daoxuan smiles and thanks. If he wants to invite master Puhong to sit on the main seat, master Puhong refuses and refuses several times. Finally, as the master of daoxuan, immortal daoxuan sat on the main seat, and master Puhong and Yun Yilan sat on both sides.</p>
<p>There are more than 100 people standing in the hall at the moment, but the seats are limited. Apart from a few well-known immortals, they are the figures of the three factions. From this, we can see the status and strength of the three factions in the right path. Naturally, most of them discuss countermeasures.</p>
<p>After all the people sat down, Yun Yilan was the first to open his mouth and asked master Pu Hong, &ldquo;master. Did you see those cruel monsters on your way to 1? &quot;</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong nodded and said, &ldquo;yes, we have removed some monsters. &quot;</p>
<p>There was a stir in the crowd. Nowadays, the disaster of animal demons has been spread all over the world, and many people have seen it. However, in the jade Hall of Qingyun Mountain, few of the other sects have dealt with them except the disciples of the three major sects who went out to inquire about the news.</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan was also moved and said, &ldquo;Oh. There is such a thing, the master might as well talk about it and let all of you know about it. &quot;</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong said, &ldquo;I dare not. In fact, we did not expect to encounter these monsters on the way over. All along, we have heard that these demons are still rampant in the south, but in a small village seven hundred miles south of Qingyun Mountain, we found that a dozen monsters were attacking the village. Unfortunately, we went too late, and all the villagers were killed. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! &ldquo;Daoxuan immortal and Yun Yilan both exclaimed. Seven hundred miles to the south of Qingyun Mountain, although it is not close, it is not far away. At this time, most of the monks in Tianyin temple, standing behind master Puhong, showed unbearable expression on their faces. Several monks also chanted Buddhism together. I think the scene at that time must have been very tragic, which left a deep impression on these monks.</p>
<p>Master Puhong sighed, and his face flashed with a sigh. &ldquo;The monsters are as good as the legend. They are derived from several wild animals in southern Xinjiang, and they are cruel and killing. The villagers have not left a living. Even if we break the law of killing and our practice is damaged, we also want to get rid of the evils for the people. We will go down and get rid of them. &quot;</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan stood up with one hand and said, &ldquo;master is acting for heaven. What you do is merit, not sin. Master doesn&rsquo;t have to be sad about it. &quot;</p>
<p>Pu Hong sighed and nodded. Yun Yilan frowned, but he was concerned about another question. He said, &ldquo;master abbot, I have another thing to ask for. &quot;</p>
<p>Pu Hong said, &ldquo;master of cloud Valley, please speak. &quot;</p>
<p>Yun Yi Lan said, &ldquo;we didn&rsquo;t hear that these demons had already arrived there. Since the master met this time, the monster must be near Qingyun Mountain soon. I don&rsquo;t know whether the master has found the beast demon in addition to this village? &quot;</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong shook his head and said, &ldquo;this is not true. Except in that village, we haven&rsquo;t seen it in other places. It seems that a small number of evil spirits are running fast, and we just caught them. &quot;</p>
<p>Taoist immortal sighed, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s just their bad luck. It&rsquo;s a pity that they can&rsquo;t save the villagers.&rdquo;. When the monks heard the words, they all chanted the name of Buddha.</p>
<p>Yun Yilan nodded slightly and said, &ldquo;master, how about the fighting power of the monsters and the eminent monks in Tianyin temple? &quot;</p>
<p>Pu Hong said, &ldquo;most of these monsters are ordinary monsters, but they are powerful, sharp and fierce. If we compare them, we can surpass them in their common practice. &quot;</p>
<p>Yun Yilan nodded and said, &ldquo;it seems that most of these monsters are ordinary monsters, and they have separated from the company. &ldquo;He said. After a pause, he turned to Li Xun and said, &ldquo;xun&rsquo;er, tell master Pu Hong what we have heard these days. &quot;</p>
<p>Li Xun answered. He walked out and saluted master Puhong. Master Puhong said with a smile, &ldquo;nephew Li, don&rsquo;t be too polite. Please say it. &quot;</p>
<p>Li Xun nodded his head and said, &ldquo;report to master, since these days, we have sent our colleagues to the south to investigate. There are three main reasons for this disaster.</p>
<p>First, most of the common beasts and monsters seem to be the variation of beasts. Although we don&rsquo;t know what the change is, these monsters are indeed more ferocious and cruel than the original ones, and ordinary people are determined to be unable to resist them; second, the number of monsters and monsters coming out of the South this time is so numerous that our disciples have seen nothing in the sky many times The number of monsters swarmed in, at least more than tens of thousands. Under such circumstances, no matter how high you are, you will not be able to do anything. Thirdly, among these ordinary beasts and demons, there seems to be an unknown number of special monsters. These monsters are quite different from ordinary monsters. They are especially superior to many practitioners. Moreover, up to now, no one has ever seen the legendary beast God, nor do they know what he is. But seeing that he can manipulate the numerous monsters, I&rsquo;m afraid he is also an extremely difficult figure! &quot;</p>
<p>Master Puhong&rsquo;s white eyebrows wrinkled tightly. The monks in Tianyin Temple behind him also looked at each other. This time, the beast demon catastrophe happened. The situation is obviously unprecedented. Judging from Li Xun&rsquo;s expression when he speaks and the dignified expressions of characters like Qingyun gate and burning incense Valley, it is obvious that people are also in a heavy mood.</p>
<p>There was a silence in the hall. For a long time, Yun Yilan took a long breath and said with a smile, &ldquo;if these monsters are not powerful. How could it be a catastrophe! It&rsquo;s useless to think too much about it. Let&rsquo;s discuss how to resist these demons. &quot;</p>
<p>Taoist immortal daoxuan nodded his head and said, &ldquo;the Lord of cloud Valley is quite right. Is that right! I also have some bad tea that I have collected for many years. Please taste it in the inner hall. We&rsquo;ll talk while we drink. &quot;</p>
<p>Master Puhong and Yun Yilan both stood up and exchanged a few words with each other under the door. Then they walked into the inner hall with Taoist immortal daoxuan. As soon as the three dignitaries left, the atmosphere in Yuqing hall gradually relaxed. Xiao Yicai, Qi Hao, Li Xun, etc. were old acquaintances with FA Xiang and FA Shan of Tianyin temple. They all came to talk together. Taking advantage of this rare time, Xiao Yi proposed to take advantage of FA Xiang and FA Shan to have a good look at the scenery of Tongtian peak. FA Xiang and others readily agreed, but Li Xun and others happened to have nothing to do, so they walked out together.</p>
<p>This season is already summer time, the human climate has been gradually hot, but on this towering Tongtian peak, it is still incomparably cool. Walking to the top of a cliff with railings, you can see the boundless sea of clouds and the blue sky in the distance from the top of the mountain. You can&rsquo;t help but have the heart of being born.</p>
<p>FA Xiang exclaimed, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard that Qingyun Mountain is a fairyland on earth. I&rsquo;ve been here once ten years ago, which has greatly opened my eyes. Goodbye today, it&rsquo;s still so spectacular and exciting. It&rsquo;s really a wonder in the world! &quot;</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai said with a smile, &ldquo;brother FA Xiang, you are welcome again. If you want to talk about the scenery, are the wordless jade wall, Xumi road and mustard hill of Tianyin temple in Xumi mountain more famous all over the world? &quot;</p>
<p>FA Xiang said with a smile, &ldquo;those are small scenes. How can they be compared with such a spectacular scene as Qingyun. As the rest of his eyes turned, he suddenly found Li Xun and Yan Hong standing behind him. Yan Hong has nothing to do with it, but Li Xun&rsquo;s face seems somewhat unconvinced. After all, it&rsquo;s not the same year. Now he has a little bit more self-restraint and has not expressed it.</p>
<p>FA Xiang was careful and had no change in his face. Naturally, he went on: &ldquo;but if we really want to talk about these scenes, I think there is only one burning sky in the burning incense valley of senior brother Li. Right, brother Li? &quot;</p>
<p>Li Xun was stunned, with a smile on his face, but he still said humbly, &ldquo;brother FA Xiang, I&rsquo;m flattered. The small place of the burning incense Valley is located in a remote place, so I dare not compare with the local customs. &quot;</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai had a deep sense in his eyes. After a look at FA Xiang, he showed a smile in his mouth. Then he said with a smile, &ldquo;OK, OK, we don&rsquo;t have to boast about it. Anyway, every place has its own scenery. The vast land of the world is so vast, whether we can see it all in our lifetime? &quot;</p>
<p>All of them were moved for a moment and said in unison, &ldquo;yes. &ldquo;And they laughed together.</p>
<p>They talked and laughed for a while, but Li Xun seemed to think of something. He walked slowly to Xiao Yicai, taking advantage of no one&rsquo;s attention. In a low voice, &ldquo;elder martial brother Xiao, may I ask you. &quot;</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai was stunned and said, &ldquo;elder martial brother Li, it&rsquo;s OK to say something. &quot;</p>
<p>Li Xun hesitated for a moment. Finally, he said, &ldquo;this These days, especially today&rsquo;s such an important day, why haven&rsquo;t you seen sister Lu Xueqi from xiaozhufeng? &quot;</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai&rsquo;s face changed slightly and he took a look at Li Xun. In a low voice, &ldquo;elder martial brother Li and younger sister Lu have been ordered to reflect on their mistakes at the moon watching platform of xiaozhufeng for several days because they contradicted our master daoxuan in Yuqing hall.</p>
<p>&quot;</p>
<p>Li Xun uttered &ldquo;ah&rdquo; in his mouth. His expression was complex, sad, ashamed and angry. After a long time, he sighed again and gave a bitter smile to Xiao Yicai, and said, &ldquo;thank you very much for telling me. I can&rsquo;t thank you enough. Later, I&rsquo;ll ask the master to persuade him to say something to master Xuan. Alas, I&rsquo;ll try my best. &quot;</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai nodded and did not speak. He just put out his hand and patted him on the shoulder.</p>
<p>Standing in the distance, among the people who were looking at the beautiful scenery of heaven and earth, FA Xiang slowly withdrew his eyes from the two whispering people behind him. Suddenly, he heard someone say in a low voice, &ldquo;master, do you know that senior brother Li proposed marriage to sister Lu Xueqi? &quot;</p>
<p>FA Xiang smiles and looks at Qi Hao standing beside him. He said, &ldquo;I have heard a little. &quot;</p>
<p>Qi Hao nodded and stopped talking, but FA Xiang suddenly sighed with emotion in his voice. Qi Hao was slightly surprised. &ldquo;Brother FA Xiang, why do you sigh so? &quot;</p>
<p>With a faint smile, FA Xiang regained his original look and said, &ldquo;nothing. I just remembered an old friend. &quot;</p>
<p>Qi Hao said: &ldquo;old friend, what old friend? &quot;</p>
<p>The Dharma minister said leisurely, &ldquo;one has been living and dying with us. My old friend who has a lot to do with Miss Lu &quot;</p>
<p>Qi Hao was silent for a long time. After a long time, he also sighed heavily. In his voice, there was a feeling of the vicissitudes of the world and the change of things and people.</p>
<p>The main altar of Wandu gate is located in a place called &ldquo;poisonous snake Valley&rdquo; in the southwest of Middle Earth. In terms of geographical location, poisonous snake Valley and Huqi mountain of Guiwang sect and Xiaoyao stream of Hehuan sect just form a big triangle, which restricts and confronts each other, forming a strong balance of power in today&rsquo;s demon religion.</p>
<p>But at the moment, this balance has reached a precarious situation, especially in the original Wandu gate, which was the most powerful of the demon sect. With the death of the old master of the old poison God and the issue of the inheritance right of the new sect leader, the ten thousand poison gate has become a mess, and the poisonous snake Valley, where the general forum is located, is already in a state of tension.</p>
<p>Nominally speaking, he got the last order of poison God, and Qin Wuyan, the close disciple of poison God, had the official successor status. Unfortunately, in the demon sect, especially in the sect of Wandu sect, which advocates martial arts and is more powerful than all others, it is useless to rely on the will of poison God alone.</p>
<p>Shortly after the poison God died, several of his other disciples rushed back to the poisonous snake Valley and showed a fierce attitude to fight for the position of the sect leader. Although Qin Wuyan is well-known by the poison God, and his skills are far better than some of his senior brothers, on the one hand, he is not very experienced in the Wandu sect, and some important experts in the sect are offering sacrifices to them. On the other hand, Qin Wuyan was ambushed and seriously injured by the bloody childe of the ghost King clan in the last time in the dead marsh. Although he has recovered by now, he is still in the fierce hands However, the evil magic weapon, blood sucking beads, really made him suffer. The power of the blood eating demon was firmly absorbed in his internal Qi like a maggot with bones, which greatly reduced his accomplishments and gave other people the opportunity to peep into the throne.</p>
<p>However, fortunately, at this critical juncture, Qin Wuyan finally eliminated this strange blood eating Demon power from his body by using the weird method of the true transmission of poison God and the use of five kinds of highly toxic drugs including &ldquo;seven tailed centipede&rdquo;. But this matter of great importance just happened a few days ago. Qin Wuyan was deep-seated and kept this secret. He knew that he was the target of public criticism, so he was willing to bear it.</p>
<p>His patience soon paid off. Fan Xiong, Cheng Wuya and Duan Rushan, the three elder martial brothers who had worked together to snatch the throne of the sect leader, discovered that the most feared younger martial brother was a semi disabled person with internal injuries and suffering. Moreover, he sincerely said that master had indeed passed the title of headmaster to him on his deathbed, but he himself did He didn&rsquo;t want to sit in this position at all. He handed over the seal of the headmaster on the spot and put it in front of the spirit throne of poison God, indicating that only those who become the sect leader can get it. The alliance of these three poisonous gods quickly began to collapse.</p>
<p>At present, there are three schools for the experts and disciples of Wandu sect. The group headed by baiduzi stands on the side of the eldest martial brother fan Xiong. At that time, the blood sucking old demon who hated to kill Zhang Xiaofan and his good friend Duanmu Laozu stood behind Lao Er Cheng&rsquo;s toothless teeth, and the remaining old Duan was like a mountain. Although Tao Xing ranked the last among the four disciples of poison God, he was always good at scheming and had been plotting secretly for a long time. However, his power was the most powerful for the time being. Many old monsters of Wandu sect who had not been born for a long time were attracted by him. Nearly half of his disciples are on his side.</p>
<p>Now in the poisonous snake Valley, it is the last day of offering sacrifices to the poisonous God touqi.</p>
<p>The news of poison God&rsquo;s death has been spread out. White banners are like a mountain above the spirit hall, but it is rare to hear a cry or two. Although most of the disciples of Wandu sect wore white silk on their heads and covered with sackcloth, they did not even have a trace of sadness on their faces. On the contrary, many of them glared at each other and confronted people from another school. If it wasn&rsquo;t for the last bit of face on the Lingtang, I&rsquo;m afraid it would have become a Wutang rather than a Lingtang.</p>
<p>Four disciples of poison God. All of them knelt down in front of the crowd, but except Qin Wuyan, the other three stood up after only three kowtows, and then stood aside. Many people also stood behind each other, confronting each other, and countless eyes were consciously or unconsciously looking at a small green box placed on the table in front of the coffin in the spirit hall, with four characters written on it</p>
<p>The seal of ten thousand poisons.</p>
<p>It is the seal that the master of Wandu sect has possessed since ancient times.</p>
<p>There are three kinds of fruits on the table. On the ground in front of the table is a copper basin burning with fire. After Qin Wuyan kowtows his head, he is different from the three elder martial brothers. Kneeling to one side silently, he took paper money and put them into a copper basin and burned them to the dead. But his three senior brothers didn&rsquo;t look him in the eye. Anyway, no matter who became the master of the sect, the useless man could not escape the fate of being poisoned.</p>
<p>Their attention is still more on the small box.</p>
<p>Fan Xiong, with a face full of flesh and fierce expression, suddenly snorted coldly. He stepped forward to the table, but Cheng Wuya and Duan Rushan, who had been on guard for a long time, almost flashed out at the same time. Duan Rushan sneered and said, &ldquo;elder martial brother, the first seven of master has not been finished. What do you want to do? &quot;</p>
<p>Fan Xiong&rsquo;s eyes glared, and a fierce light flashed on his face. He said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a senior brother. Of course, I&rsquo;ll inherit this son.&rdquo;. &quot;</p>
<p>Cheng Wuya gave a peep and said, &ldquo;where do you see that this position is where the elder martial brother is sitting? &quot;</p>
<p>Duan Rushan also sneered and said, &ldquo;you want to say the rules of the elders and the children. If you really want to say the rules, master will also pass on the throne to the younger martial brother on his deathbed. Where can I get you? &quot;</p>
<p>Fan Xiong&rsquo;s eyes flashed fiercely. He looked back at Qin Wuyan. Qin Wuyan did not raise his head. His voice still sounded like he was short of breath. He coughed and said, &ldquo;three senior brothers, you just came back Cough, cough At that time, I had handed in the seal letter immediately and explained that I was not interested in this position. You Cough You started earlier than me, and your popularity is higher than mine. Naturally, you should take this seat. Master is old. I think he was confused when he left. So he said nonsense.</p>
<p>If you decide who will sit in this position, don&rsquo;t involve me. &quot;</p>
<p>He spoke in a deep and trembling tone. He seemed to feel guilty and afraid. There was no deep and arrogant look before. With a sneer, fan Xiong turned his head in disdain. Without looking at him again, he said, &ldquo;what are you going to do? &quot;</p>
<p>Duan Rushan sneered and said, &ldquo;needless to say, it&rsquo;s still the same as what we agreed. After the master&rsquo;s first seven passes, let him walk well, we will decide who will sit in this place tomorrow! &quot;</p>
<p>Fan Xiong glared at Duan Rushan and Cheng Wuya fiercely, but his two younger martial brothers would not be friendly to him. A moment later, fan Xiong turned around and strode out of the hall. A large number of people followed him. Cheng Wuya and Duan Rushan also went out with their men and horses. On the funeral hall, Qin Wuyan was soon left alone, kneeling silently on the ground to guard the coffin.</p>
<p>After a long time, Qin Wuyan&rsquo;s stack of paper money was burned in a copper basin. Then he slowly raised his head. His eyes under the white silk were indifferent and without luster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master &ldquo;His voice was so light that only he could hear it,&rdquo; master! You see, these people are your apprentices, your men &quot;</p>
<p>Qin Wuyan indifferent corners of the mouth, slowly pan on a sneer, cold and not with the slightest emotion. (to be continued. )</p>
