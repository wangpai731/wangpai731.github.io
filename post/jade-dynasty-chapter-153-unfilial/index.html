      <p>Qingyun Mountain leads to Tianfeng and Yuqing hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; With incredible astonishment, daoxuan real man blurted out: &ldquo;the three big faction of the demon sect have been in a decisive battle with the beast demon, the whole army has been destroyed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Standing at the head of the three current orthodox leaders, and many of the elders sitting or standing beside them, Xiao Yicai, FA Xiang, Lu Xueqi and other orthodox disciples who came back to Qingyun Mountain did not speak. Only the leader, Xiao Yi, nodded his head and said, &ldquo;yes, master, the seven of us have seen with our own eyes that there are many corpses in the southwest poisonous snake Valley, which is terrible to see. The evil cult is indeed suffering We have already found the bodies of many characters in the Huan sect and Wandu sect, including Madame Sanmiao. Only a few of the leading figures of the ghost King sect have been found, but maybe it is because the beasts and Demons devour people, so&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>Standing behind, Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s face turned white again, as if this incident and the tragedy at that time were all recorded in her heart, which made her linger. However, she was able to control her mood at this time. There was not much abnormal on the surface, and no one else could see anything. Only the first master of water and moon in xiaozhufeng, sitting in front of the crowd, was Lu Xueqi The people who raised them noticed that Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s icy and clear face seemed to have a different kind of pain.</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue frowned slightly, sighed slightly, and did not speak.</p>
<p>At the moment, the crowd in Yuqing hall is stirring up, and the voice of discussion is getting louder and louder. Looking at the faces of these righteous elites, some are surprised, some are afraid, and the others are more complex and mixed with joy. I think it is also true that the evil cult has been fighting with the Chinese Orthodox for many years, and the righteous way has not been effectively encircled and suppressed for several times, but it is a surprise that they have been annihilated by animal demons. However, since the demon sect can hold a stalemate with the right path, its strength can not be underestimated. However, in the face of the beast demon&rsquo;s attack, it has been defeated miserably. There are not a few idiots here who can think of it. The beast demon&rsquo;s next target must be Qingyun Mountain, where the world&rsquo;s righteous road is gathering.</p>
<p>But now is the last hope of the world, is it possible to block this unprecedented catastrophe?</p>
<p>No one&rsquo;s heart has a bottom!</p>
<p>Sitting in the front of the three giants of the right path, real daoxuan, master Pu Hong and Yun Yilan all frowned after a discussion in a low voice. At this time, daoxuan immortal said a few words, and master Pu Hong and Yun Yi Lan both nodded and agreed. Then Taoist immortal stood up and coughed.</p>
<p>The murmur on the Yuqing hall suddenly subsided, and everyone&rsquo;s eyes were on the Taoist immortal. Immortal daoxuan had a dignified face. After all the people were completely quiet, he said in a deep voice: &ldquo;Dear Taoist friends, we have heard everything just now. The unexpected downfall of the demon sect is totally unexpected to us. However, we still need to find out the details and whether there are any remaining evils of the demon sect that survived and escaped in the war. However, this matter is not important at present. &quot;</p>
<p>His face was grim. His eyes twinkled, but he was not angry. He said in awe: &ldquo;fellow Taoist friends, now the catastrophe is in front of us. It&rsquo;s amazing how powerful the animal demons are. But since we are people of the right path, we have no reason to retreat. This matter is complicated. I need to discuss it with master Pu Hong and master Yun Gu before making a decision. Please come back first. The period of war is not far away. I hope you can do more for the common people in the world</p>
<p>Everyone nodded and agreed. A smile appeared on the face of immortal daoxuan. Master Puhong and Yun Yilan also stood up and walked back to the hall. When immortal daoxuan was trying to keep up with him, he suddenly remembered something and said to Xiao Yicai: &ldquo;Yicai. Come along, and tell us more about the situation at that time. &quot;</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai answered, strode up, followed the Taoist immortal back into the hall.</p>
<p>As soon as the three venerable elders left the hall, it became lively and lively. All the other six orthodox disciples who came back to the southwest to inquire for information were surrounded by many people. They were surprised, shook their heads, sighed and so on All kinds of expressions and sounds.</p>
<p>In the crowd, Lu Xueqi has always been silent, light eyes, but it seems that she can not see the faces of these people in front of her, but stare at the unknown place in the distance.</p>
<p>There was a sudden low commotion in the crowd, and then let a road out. The first master of water moon in xiaozhufeng of Qingyun gate came in, followed by Wen Min and other beautiful female disciples of xiaozhufeng. Lu Xueqi regained consciousness and saw her master come to her. Her eyes were looking at herself. Her lips moved and she whispered, &ldquo;master.&rdquo; Then he lowered his head.</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue had no expression and said: &ldquo;the real leader wants to discuss this matter with other elders. There won&rsquo;t be any other things here for the time being. Please follow me back to xiaozhufeng first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi nodded and said in a low voice, &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue doesn&rsquo;t care about others. She goes to the outside of Yuqing hall first, and then Lu Xueqi follows. The name of the first seat of Qingyun gate is very important. Most of the other people in the right path present respect her very much and give way one after another. At this time, seeing Lu Xueqi and master Shuiyue going out of the Yuqing hall, Li Xun, standing on one side, glanced a little anxious. After taking a step, he just wanted to say something. Suddenly, a figure blocked him in front of him. Li Xun was surprised and took a close look. It was Wen Min, the eldest disciple of Shuiyue master.</p>
<p>Wen Min smiles at Li Xun and says, &ldquo;elder martial brother Li, younger sister Xueqi is very tired all the way. Let her have a good rest. Moreover, the time for going out this time is not short. My master has a lot to say to her</p>
<p>Li Xun looked at Wen Min a few times, and his face was disappointed, but he finally took back the steps he was about to take, and said, &ldquo;OK, but please take good care of senior sister Wen&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before Li Xun finished, Wen Min had already said with a smile: &ldquo;elder martial brother Li, don&rsquo;t worry. Sister Xueqi and I are sisters in the same family. Our feelings are better than our sisters. Naturally, I will say and do what should be done and said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li Xun&rsquo;s face turned red. He nodded and no longer spoke. He stepped aside. Wen Min and several other female disciples of xiaozhufeng also went out to the Yuqing hall. Soon, all the people of xiaozhufeng in Qingyun Mountain disappeared.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>All the way, I went back to Xiaozhu peak from Tongtian peak. After landing, master Shuiyue was indifferent and did not speak to anyone. Directly to the xiaozhufeng hall went in, people respectfully stood in place, watching master Shuiyue.</p>
<p>After the figure of master Shuiyue disappears in the building, Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s eyes seem lost. Standing still until Wen Min patted her on the shoulder, she woke up.</p>
<p>There was a trace of worry in Wen Min&rsquo;s eyes, and said in a low voice: &ldquo;younger martial sister, what&rsquo;s the matter with you. Look at you lose your soul, how many times did you not respond? &quot;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi was stunned for a moment, and reluctantly showed a smile on her face and said, &ldquo;sorry, elder martial sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wen Min shook his head and said, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s wrong with you? We are all sisters. Don&rsquo;t be so outspoken.</p>
<p>By the way, I think Shifu&rsquo;s expression is not right. I&rsquo;m going to see her. You&rsquo;ve been working hard all the way. Go back and have a good rest. &quot;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi was silent for a moment and whispered, &ldquo;master, I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m still angry with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wen Min looked at the most beautiful and outstanding junior sister in the same school, and suddenly felt that on her pale face, although it was still as beautiful, it was a little more haggard than in the past. Wen Min sighed in her heart, put her arm around Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s shoulder, and said in a soft voice, &ldquo;silly girl, don&rsquo;t think about it. How does Master treat you all the time. We and you know it in your heart. It&rsquo;s OK. I&rsquo;ll take a look at it</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi nods silently, and Wen Min smiles and instructs several other junior sisters. Just want to go away, suddenly I saw a girl come out of the front door. It was the girl&rsquo;s poem that day when she secretly stole up xiaozhufeng. She stayed on xiaozhufeng because she was not old enough and didn&rsquo;t have enough Taoism. Master Shuiyue likes her to be smart and cute, so he always keeps her by his side.</p>
<p>I saw the little poem to see here, quickly walked to Wen Min and Lu Xueqi here. Wen Min said, &ldquo;eh!&rdquo; when Xiaoshi came to her, she said, &ldquo;Xiaoshi, how did you come out? Isn&rsquo;t Shifu just back? You should be waiting. &quot;</p>
<p>Xiaoshi nodded, looked at Lu Xueqi, and said, &ldquo;elder martial sister, ladies and gentlemen, master said that I would like to ask elder martial sister Xueqi to meet her at jingzhuxuan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wen Min was stunned and looked back at Lu Xueqi. Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s mouth moved, and a trace of complexity flashed in her eyes. Then she said, &ldquo;OK, I&rsquo;m going.&rdquo; With that, she went straight ahead and disappeared in the building of xiaozhufeng.</p>
<p>Wen Min watched Lu Xueqi go far away, frowned, and said to Xiaoshi, &ldquo;Xiaoshi, did master say anything else, why call Xueqi there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaoshi shook her head and said, &ldquo;no, since master came back, she has been silent. After a while, she asked me to call sister Xueqi to see her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wen Min said &ldquo;Oh&rdquo; for a moment, but he couldn&rsquo;t understand for a moment. She shook her head and said to the other female disciples of xiaozhufeng: &ldquo;OK, now it seems that there is nothing wrong. You should go back and have a rest first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The women responded and walked away. Wen Min finally took a look at Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s direction. She felt heavy and touched for a moment, but she had five mixed feelings in her heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jingzhuxuan&rdquo; is a secluded place in xiaozhufeng hall. It is close to the back mountain, surrounded by green &ldquo;tearful bamboo&rdquo;. From time to time, the mountain wind blows and the bamboo leaves shake gently, giving people a sense of tranquility. Master Shuiyue always likes to come here alone, so other disciples of xiaozhufeng are very familiar with it.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi walked through the corridor and stepped on the bamboo path paved with smooth pebbles. All the way, she went deep into the bamboo forest, and soon came to the bamboo cottage in the bamboo forest. From the outside, she looked simple and unadorned, and the outer wall made of beads did not know how many times of wind and rain had gone through. Now there are faint old marks. On both sides of the room, there is a small window, in which you can see the figure of master Shuiyue sitting quietly.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi went to the door. The door, which was also made of bamboo, was covered. Somehow, she felt nervous in her heart. She took a deep breath and said, &ldquo;master, I&rsquo;m Xueqi. Are you calling me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue&rsquo;s voice came out of the house, flat and without any feelings, and said, &ldquo;yes, you come in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi cheered up for a moment, pushed open the door and walked in. The furnishings in the room are very simple. There are tables, chairs, tea sets, and a desk by the window with paper, inkstone and ink on it. Master Shuiyue was not a person who liked luxury. At the moment, she is sitting in front of the desk by the window, silently watching the bamboo forest outside the window.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi walked behind her, looked at the back of master Shuiyue and said in a low voice, &ldquo;master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue slowly turned around and looked at Lu Xueqi. However, Lu Xueqi seemed unwilling to look at her master and lowered her head. Neither master nor apprentice spoke. The atmosphere in the room was a little awkward for a moment. As a matter of fact, neither master Shuiyue nor Lu Xueqi talks much. In the past, such scenes did appear when they were alone, but somehow. At this time of the day, there seems to be a strange strange strange feeling between the master and the apprentice, which makes their distance much farther than before.</p>
<p>After a while, master Shuiyue broke the silence and asked in a flat voice, &ldquo;you go to the southwest this time. Did you go well along the way? &quot;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi nodded and said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s OK. The demons are rampant all the way, but we all try our best to avoid it. Finally, we find a crazy disciple of the demon sect. Then we find the poisonous snake Valley and see&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her voice suddenly stopped, and there was a visible pain on her face. Even her body seemed to shake a little. Master Shuiyue looked at Lu Xueqi with a twinkle in his eyes.</p>
<p>It seems that she is pondering something. After a moment, she looks at Lu Xueqi and says, &ldquo;have you seen him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi is stunned and looks at master Shuiyue. Although her eyes are flat, she seems to see her deep heart. Lu Xueqi looked changeable and said in a low voice, &ldquo;master, what are you talking about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue said coldly: &ldquo;I mean Zhang Xiaofan, which is now the ghost king in the clan!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Water moon&rsquo;s voice is not big. But for Lu Xueqi, it seemed like a thunder in her ear. She suddenly raised her head and looked pale. But the bright eyes of Shuiyue master standing in front of her are still staring at her eyes. Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s lips opened and closed slightly and tightly closed, without saying a word.</p>
<p>Silence came again.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how long after that, master Shuiyue&rsquo;s face relaxed slowly. She looked at Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s eyes, but also gradually more a pity and heartache look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When are you going to cheat me, Jill?&rdquo; Master Shuiyue looked at Lu Xueqi and said slowly.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi clenched her hands into fists. Her fair skin turned white because of her strength. Obviously, at this moment, her heart was also very excited. She looked at the teacher who had been raised by herself since she was a little girl. A mist of water began to appear in her eyes, but she finally resisted and bit her teeth. She slowly knelt down in front of master Shuiyue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was the disciple&rsquo;s fault that betrayed the master&rsquo;s teachings.&rdquo; Her voice became smaller and smaller, and her delicate back seemed to be shaking gently.</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue sighed and her eyes were full of vicissitudes. It seemed that from this disciple, she remembered the past, and even her own expression was somewhat sad. She slowly turned around and went to the window, looking at the green bamboo outside the window, still swaying with the wind, but I don&rsquo;t know the people back then. Do you still remember here?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get up.&rdquo; Master Shuiyue is a light tunnel.</p>
<p>There was no movement behind her, apparently Lu Xueqi was still kneeling on the ground.</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue did not say much, and said, &ldquo;Qi&rsquo;er, you are always smart. I thought you should know something even if I didn&rsquo;t say it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi knelt behind her, motionless. Only listen to master Shuiyue continue to say: &ldquo;you and that Zhang Xiaofan entangled, for you, this is a bad fate, do you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi low should a, voice almost hard to hear, way: &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue said slowly: &ldquo;what&rsquo;s more, Zhang Xiaofan has betrayed the right way and has been possessed by blood. What he has done in the past ten years doesn&rsquo;t need me to tell you more. To tell you the truth, the story between you and him has been spread all over the city for a long time. Even the master daoxuan knows that you are young and ignorant. On the other hand, they cherish your intelligence and intelligence. It is not easy to practice. This has given you opportunities again and again. Don&rsquo;t be stubborn! &quot; Speaking of the latter, master Shuiyue&rsquo;s voice gradually turned urgent, and his voice gradually became stern.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s face became more and more pale, but somehow, her body became quiet and did not tremble as gently as she had just done.</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue slowly softened his face, turned around, lifted up Lu Xueqi, and said in a soft voice, &ldquo;Qi&rsquo;er, you are my most beloved disciple. Among my peers, even among the seven veins of Qingyun sect, among the younger generation of disciples, you are the most gifted in Taoist cultivation. Your future is really limitless. I have high expectations of you, do you know? &quot;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi whispered, &ldquo;yes, master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue looked at her and said, &ldquo;with your qualification, the first position of xiaozhufeng in the future will naturally be yours. At that time, you will revere and meditate on the way of heaven. Isn&rsquo;t that what you dreamed of before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi was silent, only slightly bowed her head. On her beautiful face, in addition to her pale face, was the slowly changing brilliance in her bright eyes. There, I do not know when, the once hazy water mist has disappeared.</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue sighed and said, &ldquo;go back and think about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi stood in front of her. After hearing this, she did not immediately turn around and leave. Instead, she slowly raised her head and looked at the teacher who raised her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Jill?&rdquo; Asked master Shuiyue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master.&rdquo; Lu Xueqi slowly called a way, &ldquo;I am sorry for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue shook his head and sighed, and said, &ldquo;what stupid things to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s look seems to be wrong. There is a trace of excitement on her indifferent face, and her breath is also slow and rapid.</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue soon found that she frowned and looked at her and said, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter, Qi&rsquo;er?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi seems to have set off a storm in her heart, so that her face is also like a changeable general, but finally, she slowly to master Shuiyue, whispered: &ldquo;master, you are right, I am really confused. Between me and Zhang Xiaofan, I also know that this is an impossible evil relationship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue felt a trace of regret in his eyes, and said in a soft voice, &ldquo;Qi&rsquo;er, if you cut off your love, there is nothing remarkable about it. At least, there is master, xiaozhufeng and Qingyun gate that can accommodate you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi suddenly raised her head. Her speed and strength were astonishing. She was full of pain and sadness at the moment. Even her voice seemed to have a shiver: &ldquo;master, but I can&rsquo;t break it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue&rsquo;s face changed greatly, and he looked at Lu Xueqi deeply. Suddenly, his hands were up and down, and Lu Xueqi was slapped in the face with a slap. Lu Xueqi did not dodge, did not retreat, stood still, just bit tight lips, body slowly shaking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You, what do you say?&rdquo; Master Shuiyue&rsquo;s voice seemed to be shaking, but his words were filled with anger, &ldquo;you, you traitor, do you know what you are talking about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s face was already pale without a trace of blood, but when she met master Shuiyue&rsquo;s eyes, she seemed to have made up her mind and said, &ldquo;master, you adopted me since I was a child, raised me up, taught me to raise me. There is nothing more than this. Xue Qi is unfilial, which makes her master angry and sad. She deserves to die&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>She fluttered in white and knelt down in front of master Shuiyue again and said, &ldquo;Xue Qi would rather die than betray her teacher&rsquo;s righteousness. If she meets Zhang Xiaofan in the future, her disciples should try their best to kill him with Tianya. If she fails, she will die in his hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue began to look angry. When she heard Lu Xueqi say that she did not dare to betray the right path and to fight with Zhang Xiaofan, her face softened slightly. However, Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s words changed her face again.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi knelt down in front of her and breathed deeply. Her eyes also drew back. She looked at the ground in front of her body and seemed to be looking at her heart. She said slowly, &ldquo;but this trace of sin is something that I can&rsquo;t break without being cut off by my disciples!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The room suddenly fell into a dead silence, as if even the breath stopped. A moment later, master Shuiyue&rsquo;s shrill voice of abuse came out and reverberated in the fine room</p>
<p>&ldquo;You, you traitor, get out of here, get out of here, I don&rsquo;t want to see you again!&hellip;&rdquo; (to be continued. )</p>
