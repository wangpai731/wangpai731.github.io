      <p>The rain stopped for the time being, but the dark clouds in the sky were still very low, layer by layer, which made people feel breathless.</p>
<p>The north gate of Heyang city was opened, and countless people poured out of the city and went northward. Crying was heard all the way. No one knows where the road ahead is?</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai led the disciples of Qingyun to maintain order all the way, constantly comforting the worried and panicked people, telling people around again and again that this time is just a temporary departure. As long as we defeat the beast demon and the catastrophe is over, we can return to our homes again.</p>
<p>When he was busy this day, he was really dry and exhausted. Looking at the long dragon in front of him, Xiao Yicai shook his head and wanted to have a rest. Suddenly, he saw Lin Jingyu, who was not far away from the dragon head peak, also looked tired. He and Lin Jingyu were familiar with each other, so he walked over and patted Lin Jingyu on the shoulder.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu looked back, showing a smile and talking. Unexpectedly, his voice was dumb: &ldquo;elder martial brother, you are also here&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai answered. They looked at each other and looked at the people around them. They both shook their heads and laughed bitterly.</p>
<p>In the direction of the ancient road to the north, from a distance, it seems to be the same as the gloomy sky, with no half of the light.</p>
<p>Zhou Yixian, Xiaohuan and daoren dingou were also mixed in the crowd. Because there were too many Qingyun disciples around him and his face was strange, he covered most of his face with a cloth hat and followed Monday&rsquo;s fairy and Xiaohuan. Monday fairy walked in the crowd, looking left and right, frowning and sighing from time to time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grandfather, what&rsquo;s the matter</p>
<p>Monday immortal shook his head and said, &ldquo;this war is related to the fate of the common people in the world, but I&rsquo;m afraid that the right path on Qingyun Mountain has little chance of winning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan is silent. How much do you know why Zhou Yixian talks like this. Since the beast demon appeared in the world, in a short time, it began to enter the Middle Earth from the southern Xinjiang and swept the world all the way. Invincible, powerful, ferocious means, the harm caused has surpassed all previous natural and man-made disasters. Today, most of the last resistance in the world is concentrated on Qingyun Mountain. Most of the hopes of the people in the world are also mostly on the invincible killing immortal sword array in the legend of Qingyun gate.</p>
<p>Xiaohuan forced a smile and said: &ldquo;there is still a sword to kill the immortal array, there is hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Monday fairy shrugged his shoulders and said, &ldquo;this hey.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that people like us are left to their fate. &quot; Speaking of this, he paused for a moment, then suddenly turned his head and looked at Qingyun Mountain, which was towering in the distance and hidden in the dark clouds at the moment. The strange peak appeared to be somewhat ferocious. Then he said slowly, &ldquo;but these people in the right way! Don&rsquo;t have a fire in the backyard&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>Small ring Zheng for a moment, way: &ldquo;what backyard fire?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Monday fairy grinned strangely, shook his head and did not answer. He walked forward, and Xiaohuan glared at him. Also lazy to ask, after all, at this moment this situation, where there is a mind for those righteous. Only the wild dog Taoist, who was following the two men of Zhouxian and Xiaohuan, seemed to shake his body for a moment. His eyes, hiding in the shadow under his cloth hat, flickered ceaselessly.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu and other disciples of Qingyun have been busy for a whole day. Seeing that most of the people have passed by, Lin Jingyu is relieved. He really feels that he has done these things. More tired than facing three or five evil monsters. Just thinking of having a good rest, I suddenly passed by a child and looked at Lin Jingyu all the time.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu is a little strange and looks at the child. His clothes were shabby. He was not a child of a wealthy family, but his face was beautiful and his eyes were bright. He was very lovely.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu laughed and said in a soft voice, &ldquo;little brother. What&rsquo;s the matter</p>
<p>The child hesitated for a moment, raised his hand to pass a note, timidly said: &ldquo;just now an uncle asked me to give you a note.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu is stunned. He takes the note from the child&rsquo;s hand and unfolds it to see that there are only four characters written on it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fire in the backyard!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu frowned and pondered for a moment. He said to the child, &ldquo;what does that mean? By the way, where is the person who gave you the note just now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The child turned his head and pointed to the front. Suddenly, there was a sense of confusion on his face. He said, &ldquo;Hey, it&rsquo;s gone. It was an uncle with a hat just now. Let me give it to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu looked at the note in his hand and frowned. After a moment, he looked up and saw a vast sea of people. But where did he go to find the mysterious figure in the hat that the child said he was wearing?</p>
<p>Qingyun Mountain, xiaozhufeng.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jingle!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sound is like a dragon&rsquo;s chant, a room of no light, Tianya sword is horizontal in the hand, Lu Xueqi has no expression and looks at each other with the sword. On the sword blade like autumn water, her face is reflected, which is like bullying frost and winning snow.</p>
<p>She gazed deeply at the sharp blade, and Tianya seemed to feel something, a little shiver, as if excited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you thinking?&rdquo; Wen Min&rsquo;s voice came from the side. Lu Xueqi looked at the sword in her hand silently. After a long time, she said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know who&rsquo;s going to bleed on the blade after a few days?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wen Min slowly walked to her side, patted Lu Xueqi on the shoulder, and said in a soft voice, &ldquo;OK, my good younger martial sister, at the present time of great calamity, the master will no longer pursue your disobedience to her.</p>
<p>As long as we do our best in this war, there must be no way out. &quot;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi nodded, but somehow, there was always some lingering gloom in her heart and said in a low voice, &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wen Min said with a smile, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s good. Master is still waiting for us to go to tongtianfeng together! Let&rsquo;s go</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi nodded again, put away Tianya and took a deep breath. Then she followed Wen Min and walked out.</p>
<p>Winding along the corridor, we come to the mountain in front of xiaozhufeng. Master Shuiyue is already standing there, and there are several female disciples of xiaozhufeng. Wen Min and Lu Xueqi step forward. Wen Min first says, &ldquo;master, I&rsquo;m here with Xueqi.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue stood with a negative hand. At the moment, she slowly turned around and looked at Wen Min, then fell on Lu Xueqi. Lu Xueqi lowered her head and did not dare to look at her eyes. She said in a soft voice, &ldquo;master, I&rsquo;m here. The filial piety of my disciples makes you angry. &quot;</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue said faintly, &ldquo;I have no time to be angry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s face seemed to be pale again. People around her did not dare to speak. Wen Min shook her head slightly, looked at master Shuiyue, and called out with an imploring voice: &ldquo;master&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue snorted, and then sighed again, saying, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s all. Let&rsquo;s put these aside for the time being! If we can save our lives in this great war, then we can talk about it. &quot;</p>
<p>All the disciples did not dare to answer. Master Shuiyue waved his sleeve robe. He turned around and said calmly, &ldquo;go, the leader is still waiting for us on Tongtian peak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The voice just fell, a white light wrapped her figure and rose into the sky. Wen Min looked at Lu Xueqi. Lu Xueqi forced a smile. Wen Min whispered: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s OK. Don&rsquo;t think about it. &quot;</p>
<p>With that, she turned to the crowd and said, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment, the light on the Xiaozhu peak was shining brightly, and the beautiful lights were flying towards the sky, and the dark clouds added some color to the sky. However, the dark clouds all over the sky, but in a flash, they devoured the brilliance.</p>
<p>Qingyun Mountain, Dazhu peak.</p>
<p>Song Daren, led by five younger martial brothers, stands outside the Shoujing hall, waiting for Tian Buyi and Su Ru to appear, but it seems that a long time has passed. Tian Buyi and his wife still did not come out.</p>
<p>Du Bishu, the sixth disciple, was a little out of breath. He whispered to song Daren, &ldquo;elder martial brother, why hasn&rsquo;t Shifu come out yet? What are they doing in there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren gave Du Bishu a look and said: &ldquo;how do I know? You&rsquo;d better go in and look after it if you want to know so much!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Du Bishu hit a nail, and then he shrunk back and complained: &ldquo;I know, I know. You can&rsquo;t get a wife by yourself. Don&rsquo;t take it out on me</p>
<p>Song Daren&rsquo;s ear tip, actually heard, can&rsquo;t help but get angry, put out his hand and hit Du Bishu on the back of the head. Angry way: &ldquo;what do you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Du Bishu was startled. He was always timid. In addition to the reverence for his master&rsquo;s mother, he was the eldest brother. However, song Daren was very easygoing, but it seemed that this was a bad thing for Wen min. It was a big blow to him, and he got angry.</p>
<p>Next to him, several elder martial brothers were forced to smile and squint at Du Bishu. Du Bishu&rsquo;s face was embarrassed. When he wanted to ask for help from other senior brothers, he Dazhi and Wu Dayi looked up at the sky or the distant mountains one by one. They looked up at the leisurely scene of being out of the world, which was a kind of immortal who did not care about the world.</p>
<p>Du Bishu glared at these ungrateful senior brothers, and finally had to smile at Song Daren and say, &ldquo;elder martial brother, don&rsquo;t worry. After the disaster, I&rsquo;ll go down the mountain and ask the best matchmaker to help you get married&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before the words fell, song Daren, a purple faced man, kicked Du Bishu a long way away. He Dazhi and others nearby snickered and shook their heads. Only Du Bishu was depressed and sat on the ground.</p>
<p>A faint laugh came in from outside the hall. Tian Buyi and Su Ru listened to her. Su Ru&rsquo;s dignified face showed a rare smile. Then she sighed and said in a soft voice, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not easy. The disciples are waiting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Buyi, dressed in long clothes and solemn, stood in front of the statue of Sanqing in Shoujing hall and nodded in silence. Then he gazed at the three statues, stepped forward, took three sticks of incense from the altar, lit them on the candle, solemnly saluted them, and bowed down three times.</p>
<p>After inserting the incense into the censer, Tian does not stand in silence. Su Ru also worships three times with a respectful look.</p>
<p>Just when they were ready to return, Tian Bu Yi suddenly thought of something and stopped. Su Ru was a little stunned and turned around and said, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter? It&rsquo;s not easy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi frowned for a while, suddenly turned around and strode to walk, but he went around behind the statue of Sanqing. Su Ru&rsquo;s face changed. She seemed to understand something. However, seeing her expression, she seemed to be hesitant, but she still followed Tian Bu Yi.</p>
<p>After the statue, there is also a altar table, but the scale is much smaller than the front, and there are yellow cloth curtains hanging down beside it, covering most of them. Tian Buyi stood in front of the small altar and looked for a while, but he didn&rsquo;t start to worship. After a long time, he reached into the cloth curtain and gently groped for a few times. Unexpectedly, from the edge of the altar, he took out a wooden tablet of spiritual position. On the top of it, it was engraved with: elder martial brother wanjian, one spirit throne!</p>
<p>Su Ru watched and watched Tian Bu Yi gently wipe the dust on the tablet with his sleeve. The dust was not thick. It was obvious that someone often wiped it. When it was clean, Tian Bu Yi put the tablet on the altar, took three sticks of incense from the side, and worshipped it three times.</p>
<p>Su Ru was indifferent and said in a low voice: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not easy. What are you doing here? Do you still hope that elder martial brother Wan will protect Qingyun at this pass?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi said coldly: &ldquo;after all, elder martial brother Wan was born in Qingyun. He is proud, but he attaches great importance to his school. If he knew what was going on today, there was a spirit in heaven. It will certainly protect the green cloud. &quot;</p>
<p>Su Ru was silent. After a long time, she shook her head and sighed.</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi looked at the memorial tablet for a long time, then slowly said, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the two of them came out of the Shoujing hall. Song Daren and other disciples have already been waiting outside the door. Tian Buyi looks at Du Bishu from Song Daren and nods. He does not know why, and then he takes a glance at the quiet disciple&rsquo;s house in the distance. In the eyes, there seems to be a trace of helplessness.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s because of the impending catastrophe and the impending war! Tian was in a bad mood and didn&rsquo;t talk much. Looking at the disciples who had been waiting for a long time, Tian finally just nodded and said, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go! Go to Tongtian peak. &quot;</p>
<p>In the flash of light, Tian is not easy to take the lead. Su Ru follows closely, and the disciples of Dazhu peak quickly follow. The sky of dark clouds, once again across a number of brilliant lights, and then disappeared in the clouds.</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai, Lin Jingyu and other Qingyun disciples were so tired that they finally sent all the people in Heyang city to the ancient road to the north when it was getting dark. At the same time, from outside Heyang City, sporadic people gathered and went northward.</p>
<p>Just a day and a night, Xiao Yicai and Lin Jingyu and other Qingyun disciples looked as if they had lost weight and were very tired. And everyone&rsquo;s voice is almost hoarse.</p>
<p>Standing at the head of Qingyun City, looking at the disappearing figure of the people in the distance, Xiao Yicai was relieved. With a bitter smile and a hoarse voice, he said to Lin Jingyu, who was standing beside him: &ldquo;I finally saw him off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu is also a long breath, has been tense expression temporarily relaxed, but his eyebrows have been frowning, not like Xiao Yicai general completely relaxed, as if there is something in mind to remember the same.</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai is a wise man. He soon found that Lin Jingyu had a trace of solemnity between his eyebrows. He asked, &ldquo;why, younger martial brother Lin, do you think there is anything wrong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu was stunned for a moment, shook his head and said, &ldquo;elder martial brother misunderstood me. I don&rsquo;t feel wrong. I&rsquo;m just worried about the catastrophe in front of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai nodded, patted him on the shoulder and said, &ldquo;I know, in fact, I am not so. However, as the saying goes, evil can not suppress justice. Heaven has no way out. You and I are all under the right path. For the sake of the common people in the world, we should try our best to fight in the next day. We don&rsquo;t have to think about it. &quot;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu laughed and nodded: &ldquo;what elder martial brother said is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai smiles and says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go there and have a look.&rdquo; He left Lin Jingyu and went to the side. He wanted to go back to Heyang city to have a closer look. Don&rsquo;t miss any common people. Otherwise, once the animal demon comes, it will be inevitable.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, he took a few steps, and suddenly Lin Jingyu&rsquo;s low voice came from behind him</p>
<p>&ldquo;After Fire After&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai was stunned. He turned his head and saw Lin Jingyu frown tightly. His face seemed puzzled. He stood in the same place and whispered something. He listened carefully, but it seemed that he was a little vague. It was the last sound.</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai raised his eyebrows and said, &ldquo;younger martial brother Lin, what&rsquo;s wrong with Houshan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu was startled and raised his head and said, &ldquo;back mountain, what back mountain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the contrary, Xiao Yicai was stunned by him and said, &ldquo;I heard you talk about Houshan and Houshan all the time. I think you often go to our ancestral temple of tongtianfeng to offer sacrifices and help. You think something happened to Houshan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu&rsquo;s face was a little embarrassed, and even said, &ldquo;no, no, I was talking to myself in a disorderly way, which worried my elder martial brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai chuckled and said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s OK to be OK, younger martial brother Lin. the war is coming. You should cultivate your spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu smiles and nods, and is about to speak. Suddenly, a cry from Qingyun disciple is heard in the distance. Xiao Yicai and Lin Jingyu are shocked. Almost at the same time, they rise up and fly to the place where the alarm occurs.</p>
<p>The sound place is the South Gate of Heyang city. There are several Qingyun disciples there for the final inspection. But at the moment, one by one, they are facing a great enemy, and their magic weapons are sacrificed. Their expression is tense. Above the city wall, a ferocious monster with a lion&rsquo;s head and a wolf&rsquo;s body was seen. His eyes were bright and his mouth was roaring. He was staring at these green cloud disciples. However, he seemed to know that these people were not ordinary people, so he did not act rashly.</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai and Lin Jingyu fall down. At this time, other Qingyun disciples come in succession. After everyone sees it clearly, they all take a cold breath, and Xiao Yi takes a breath. In a low voice, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a monster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly, a Qingyun disciple beside Lin Jingyu called out and said, &ldquo;outside, outside&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Voice panic. Hearing this, all of a sudden their hearts seemed to be raised. They almost looked at the direction that Qingyun disciple pointed out in the distance outside Heyang city.</p>
<p>Under the sky, on the horizon. The thunder came and the lightning broke through the sky. The earth is trembling slightly, the deep roar of the earth seeps slowly from the depths of the nine secluded places, but it rushes into the soul of human beings and reverberates endlessly.</p>
<p>Countless monsters gathered together to make a terrifying tide of boundless black, surging from afar, rumbling like thunder, but it has already overwhelmed the thunder in the sky, killing heaven and earth, lighting like a strange snake scurrying. The evil spirit that forces people&rsquo;s hearts even though they are far away from each other is already coming.</p>
<p>All the disciples of Qingyun are bloodless. Xiao Yicai bit his teeth and said in a loud voice, &ldquo;go, go quickly, and go back to Qingyun Mountain immediately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In his words, the disciples of Qingyun did not dare to neglect him. They sacrificed their swords and flew into the sky. The monster with the lion head and wolf body roared loudly on the wall, which looked fierce.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu followed the crowd at last and looked back in the mid air, and saw endless monsters coming. The whole land seems to have been a sea of evil beasts, and there is no human spirit.</p>
<p>This catastrophe, finally came the most critical time!</p>
<p>After hearing the urgent report that Xiao Yicai and others rushed back, there were all the right paths in the Yuqing Hall of Tongtian peak in Qingyun Mountain. No one spoke for a moment.</p>
<p>Silence is shrouded in this grand hall. What should come is still coming.</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan rose slowly with a solemn face and said slowly, &ldquo;gentlemen, this is the destiny of the world. At present, the beast demon occupies Heyang City, and will soon attack Qingyun. I have no more words here. Please go back to have a rest and have a fight with the monster in the future. &quot;</p>
<p>Everyone looked at each other, and after a moment they all stood up. There were more whispers in the Yuqing hall. In this low murmur, everyone went out one after another.</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan turned to master Puhong and Yun Yilan, who were sitting beside him, and said, &ldquo;please have a rest. I have something to discuss with other heads of Qingyun gate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pu Hong and Yun Yi Lan both stood up and said in reply, &ldquo;please help yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan returns a salute and says hello to Xiao Yicai. Xiao Yicai quickly follows him. As immortal daoxuan enters the back hall, some place there, the other first elders of Qingyun gate are already waiting for them.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu watched them leave. Then he walked out of the Yuqing hall alone. He walked to the railing outside the hall and looked at the fence. He saw the sky like ink, dark clouds and no light.</p>
<p>The mountain wind is like a knife, whining and blowing. It hurts when it blows.</p>
<p>He stood in silence, but in his mind, he thought of the mysterious note and the four words above.</p>
<p>Fire in the backyard</p>
<p>A fire in the backyard, a fire in the backyard? What backyard fire? Lin Jingyu turned countless thoughts in his heart. Finally, his thoughts gradually converged to a point. It was Xiao Yicai&rsquo;s words of dismay echoing in his ears: &ldquo;what&rsquo;s wrong with Houshan, younger martial brother Lin&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Back mountain?</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu frowned again. Although his eyes were bright, he slowly shook his head and became confused again.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how long he stayed in this meditation. After he regained his mind, he found that there was no one around him. Lin Jingyu sighed and walked slowly down the steps.</p>
<p>Since the appearance of beast demons, Qingyun gate has strengthened the guard of Qingyun Mountain, especially in the front mountain. No one knows when those ferocious beasts will suddenly rush up. However, Qingyun Mountain has always been steep, especially Tongtian peak. It is easy to defend and difficult to attack. However, these are not too big obstacles for those who have accomplished their cultivation, but they are excellent barriers for many monsters who can&rsquo;t fly.</p>
<p>However, all along, the beast demon has been invincible, and there are countless amazing and terrible news, and no one is sure that these monster will not have any unexpected way to attack. What&rsquo;s more, no one knows the details of the legendary beast God to this day, which adds to the public&rsquo;s suspicion.</p>
<p>Compared with the mountains in front of Qingyun gate, the mountains behind Qingyun gate are almost entirely cliffs, making it difficult for apes to cross. Nevertheless, Qingyun gate has arranged many disciples to patrol the sky with swords, just in case. It&rsquo;s just a little strange, that is, near the magic moon cave, the forbidden area of Qingyun gate, and the ancestral hall on the edge of the forbidden area, there are very few Qingyun disciples on guard. It seems that Qingyun gate is not worried about these two places at all.</p>
<p>And now the dark night has just passed. At the beginning of the day, a light mist filled the path leading to the ancestral temple and the forbidden area of the moon enchanting cave. With the mountain breeze gently drifting, lingering on both sides of the road between the branches of pine and cypress trees.</p>
<p>At this moment, even birds can&rsquo;t be heard. The moisture condenses into crystal dew and flows down the edge of green leaves. It drips quietly.</p>
<p>There is no trace of human beings!</p>
<p>Suddenly, a figure appeared on the path, which was very fierce.</p>
<p>His face was indifferent, and he could not see any fear or worry in the enemy&rsquo;s territory, nor the tension near the forbidden area. He just walked along slowly without expression.</p>
<p>This road, he has also gone through, ten years ago</p>
<p>Ten years later, it seems that the scenery is still the same, nothing has changed. The pine and cypress are evergreen and the vegetation is flourishing. Even the underground soil on which he steps seems to be as moist and soft as it was then.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that he&rsquo;s changed.</p>
<p>Mountain wind in the forest branches, and blowing through his lapel, brush his hair, lying on the shoulder of the small ash seems to be still sleepy, pull eyes, tail wrapped in the fierce arm. But the eye of the ghost sharp, but is strange bright.</p>
<p>The path twists and turns. Toward the mountains, the mist in front of the body gently dispersed, and behind quietly closed, he walked in this confusion, straight forward. Never looked back.</p>
<p>All the way.</p>
<p>When we got to the Trident, the path slightly to the left was still a deep path, while the path to the right revealed several eaves of the palace behind the woods.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the ancestral hall. GUI Li said so in his heart. Ten years ago, it was here that he and Lin Jingyu fought against the powerful enemy of the demon cult. That is to say, Lu Xueqi confronted him here.</p>
<p>But now, he has been with these years, these old friends look like strangers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sand, sand&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the depths of the forest, it seems that someone is cleaning something early, gently melodious, standing quietly listening, there is some trance, as if the years of time, originally in this fine &ldquo;sand&rdquo; sound, quietly reverberating ripples, quietly passed away.</p>
<p>He suddenly seemed to wake up from a dream and suddenly turned back. The atmosphere of silence seemed to solidify for a moment. Even the slight rustling sound in the distance seemed to stop silent.</p>
<p>Behind him, I do not know when, standing a man in black, black veil masked - Mr. ghost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are here,&rdquo; he said in a deep voice</p>
<p>Mr. ghost said quietly, &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why are you here?&rdquo; he said</p>
<p>Mr. ghost shook his head and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here to help you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you say?&rdquo; he sneered</p>
<p>Ghost Mr. light way: &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t have to doubt, some things you don&rsquo;t know, I specially come to tell one. There is no mechanism outside the magic moon cave, but there is a multiplication array inside. It is the spirit of guarding the ancient sword and killing the immortals. Its origin is the same as that of the immortal killing sword array. If an outsider wants to rush in and touch the Dharma array, it will be like startling the sword array for killing immortals. If you are conceited that you can defeat the ancient sword and kill the immortal, I have nothing to say</p>
<p>The pupils contracted, and in the distant fog, the light mist seemed to shake slightly.</p>
<p>Mr. GUI took a sharp look at the ghost and said, &ldquo;it was very difficult for the people of the demon sect to enter the magic moon cave, but you are the exception. If you look at the world, you can only enter the magic moon cave except the leader and elder of Qingyun sect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; he said coldly</p>
<p>Mr. GUI said: &ldquo;this array must be based on the Shangqing realm of Taiji Xuanqing Road, which has been passed down from generation to generation in Qingyun gate. If you master the mechanism of the array, you can enter it. After entering, the illusions are like rain. It&rsquo;s up to you whether you can firm your mind or not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li looked at this person&rsquo;s black figure deeply. He was silent for a long time and said, &ldquo;why do you want to tell me so much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost smile, the black figure in the mist seems to be shaking, rootless, like ghosts in general, light way: &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t have to care so much, anyway, I&rsquo;ll do my best, believe it or not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Qingyun Mountain is connected to the front of Tianfeng mountain. A Qingyun Taoist boy is sweeping the fallen leaves aside. Just when he wants to have a rest, he sees a figure walking slowly on the steps at the foot of the mountain. Although there are many disciples of Qingyun sect, he has walked through it countless times in the past ten years, and they are familiar with it for a long time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Senior brother Lin.&rdquo; With a tender voice, Tao Tong said with a smile to the Lin Jingyu who came up: &ldquo;you have come so early! Are you going to the ancestral hall of Houshan again? &quot;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu smiles and nods: &ldquo;yes! I didn&rsquo;t sleep well last night, and I always felt bored, as if there was something wrong with me, so I came up early. &quot;</p>
<p>At this time, the road boys who were also cleaning up also came and gathered together. One of them asked, &ldquo;elder martial brother Lin, it is said that the beast demon has arrived at Heyang city at the foot of the mountain. Will they fight against it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other Taoist children nearby said something, but they were young after all. They were not as worried as those famous people. Although they were also worried about animal spirits, they were more optimistic.</p>
<p>Being infected by them, Lin Jingyu&rsquo;s mood was much better. He said with a smile: &ldquo;well, the beast demon is vicious. It must be able to attack Qingyun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; It was like frying a pot, and the children were making a lot of noise.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu comforted them with a smile, motioned for them to be quiet, and then said, &ldquo;but we have masters on Qingyun Mountain now. They have high magic power and profound Taoism. They are definitely not afraid of animal demons.</p>
<p>Besides, &ldquo;Lin Jingyu showed a mysterious expression on his face and said,&rdquo; we still have invincible Zhuxian sword array! Have you forgotten? &quot;</p>
<p>All the children were excited and laughed and said, &ldquo;yes! Yeah! We have Zhuxian sword array, we will win! &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is, when the demons come up, they will all die under the sword array of their ancestors and avenge the common people in the world!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Listening to these words, Lin Jingyu smiles and nods frequently. At last, he instructs the children to say a few words, and then continues to walk towards the back mountain. After leaving these carefree youngsters, his expression suddenly became dignified and walked in silence. After a long time, he sighed, shook his head, and whispered to himself, &ldquo;you&rsquo;d better go to the back mountain quickly and ask the elder for advice!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke, he quickened his pace and walked towards the ancestral hall in the back mountain of Tongtian peak.</p>
<p>And just as he walked down, the misty mist on the back of the mountain was stacking and floating gently, like a dream that had not been awakened last night.</p>
<p>At the crossroad, ghost Li and Mr. ghost looked at each other for a long time. His eyes flashed, but Mr. ghost did not retreat and looked directly at him.</p>
<p>After a long time, GUI Li did not say a word. He suddenly turned around and walked towards the deep path. Mr. ghost was behind him and watched him.</p>
<p>But at this time, suddenly, an old voice came out from the path in the direction of ancestral hall, from the white mist floating gently in that direction. With indescribable vicissitudes and tiredness, an old man&rsquo;s voice said, &ldquo;you two, where are you going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ghost Li and ghost Mr. body are a shock, looking back, see that the path of mist floating, a bent figure slowly came out. He bent slightly, as if the years had pressed him out of breath, a knife like wrinkles across his face, as if to tell the waste of time. Even the broom in his hand looked as old as the master.</p>
<p>However, the old man walked slowly to the six feet in front of GUI Li and Mr. GUI. Facing these two figures, the tired old man slowly looked up, but there was a pair of clear and pressing sharp eyes, focusing on the front.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s chilly in the morning, and the tired bird hasn&rsquo;t got up. Do you want to have a bowl of hot tea with me?&rdquo; (to be continued. )</p>
