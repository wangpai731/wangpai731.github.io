      <p>Qingyun Mountain, Dazhu peak.</p>
<p>In the dead of the night, only the sound of bamboo waves coming from the wind in the distance reverberates gently in the night sky. The lights have already been extinguished, and the disciples of dazhufeng are all at rest. Only in the back of Shoujing hall, there is a solitary lamp flashing in the dark.</p>
<p>The night wind is light and cool. It blows in from the half open window, making a slight &ldquo;whine&rdquo; sound. It also shakes the lamp on the table top in the middle of the room, and becomes unstable.</p>
<p>A white hand gently stretched out to block the wind. The fire soon stabilized and began to shine again. Su Ru sat lazily at the table. The night was deep, but she didn&rsquo;t feel sleepy.</p>
<p>The wind outside the house, or non-stop blowing, open the door and window, from time to time issued a light sound. Su Ru stood up and walked slowly to the window. Instead of closing the window immediately, she looked out of the window.</p>
<p>The sky is like ink, which is the darkest time.</p>
<p>She listened attentively, but there was no voice she wanted to hear in the wind at night.</p>
<p>Su Ru&rsquo;s face lit up a faint bitter smile. She closed the window quietly and sat back at the table again. She and Tian are not people who value luxury, and there are not many things in this bedroom. At the moment, there was only a small round mirror on the table besides a cloth bag.</p>
<p>She took the original mirror. In the round mirror, there was a dignified and beautiful woman with cloud like hair and a girl&rsquo;s skin, without a trace of wrinkles. It was not easy for her and Tian to get married. After hundreds of years of practice, she had this Taoist practice and her appearance was permanent.</p>
<p>After watching for a long time, Su Ru sighed softly, put the small round mirror on one side, took the cloth bag at the other end, and opened her.</p>
<p>Inside are some of the most common things, some needle and thread, a piece of cloth, scissors, powder wipe Ordinary world. Women in ordinary families usually have these things to sew clothes for their husbands and children. Su Ru gently took the cloth, thread the needle, and borrowed the light. Sew it carefully.</p>
<p>But she sewed and sewed, under the light of the candle, her eyes became a little confused, as if some absent-minded, do not know what to think. The sewing speed is also much slower. Just at this time, suddenly the outside of the house was like the wind. Suddenly, the sound of &ldquo;woo&rdquo; passed by, but the window that had just been closed was clapped again, and then it was blown open again.</p>
<p>A cold wind, suddenly rushed in, the candlelight on the table was blown out by the strong wind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah</p>
<p>A light cry, Su Ru frowned in the dark, on the tip of her finger. There was a sting. With her practice of Taoism, she was hurt by a small sewing needle. Even she felt a little funny. But somehow, the room was dark at the moment. When the cold night wind blew, Su Ru&rsquo;s mood was a little sad, like a big stone in her heart.</p>
<p>She sighed, put down her clothes and sewing and went to the window. The view outside the window is still the same, but the husband who has watched all this with her countless times in the past. It&rsquo;s been a long time.</p>
<p>After daybreak, maybe we should send Daren down the mountain to look for them. It&rsquo;s not the way to wait.</p>
<p>Su Ru thought so. In front of my eyes, I was worried.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s dark!</p>
<p>She gazed at the night sky for a long time, her lips trembling, not knowing what to say. After a long time, she looked down and sighed. Closed the window again.</p>
<p>Outside the house, the wind seemed to be getting sick again.</p>
<p>Huqishan, ghost King clan.</p>
<p>In the same night, some people have no sleep, but the mood may be different.</p>
<p>Hidden in the deepest part of the mountain above the blood pool, ghost king and Mr. ghost stood side by side. Mr. ghost is still wrapped in black clothes, can not see his expression clearly, but the ghost King&rsquo;s face is filled with excitement and joy.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t look tired from staying up late. As a matter of fact, with the practice of the ghost king, he could not sleep for a few days, and it would not be a big obstacle. At the moment, his face was not tired, but his hair was glowing with red light. He was full of spirit and was staring at the blood pool under his feet.</p>
<p>The blood pool soaked with countless blood has changed significantly compared with the past. The four spirit beasts are still confined in the blood and water. Even if it is the gluttonous struggle of the previous time, it seems that they have been drained of strength and slouched listlessly in the blood water without moving for half a day.</p>
<p>The water in the blood pool, which has always been very calm, is no longer calm at the moment. On the huge water surface, bubbles are constantly emerging from the depths of the blood, and at the same time, the sound of breaking is constantly coming out. Moreover, the speed is not less than several times faster than before, and the number of bubbles is much more.</p>
<p>The whole blood pool seems to be boiling. An invisible force is gradually waking up from the depth of the blood pool. And in this space, there was a bloody smell, more than ten times stronger than before.</p>
<p>In the middle of the sky, the Fulong tripod, the hub of the four spirit blood array, has also changed. The original heavy and ancient tripod seems to have absorbed a lot of aura and Demon power from the blood pool below and from the four spirits, and gradually showed a trace of red light. The bronze tripod, originally made of bronze, also presents a transparent and slightly yellowish amber Color, it seems that there is a solemn image.</p>
<p>On the tripod body, those mysterious inscriptions, one by one, have been lit up, as if they have regained life, flashing a strange light. In the middle of the picture, the head of the ferocious demon in the original four spirit beasts is still red as blood, greedily absorbing the spiritual power continuously absorbed by the Fulong Ding from below.</p>
<p>The surrounding space around the Fulong tripod, inside the sealed mountain belly, is actually a whirlpool of air like fog like clouds, faintly carrying the huge force of wind and thunder, constantly swimming around the tripod. Even the king of ghosts and Mr. ghost standing in the distance can still clearly feel that this dragon tripod contains terrible and terrible magic power, and this strange magic power is still constantly adding and strengthening.</p>
<p>Like the ghost king, Mr. ghost also looks at the Fulong Ding, but his eyes are cold and sharp. Compared with the ghost king, it is less fanatical and more calm.</p>
<p>Mr. GUI looked at the Fulong Ding for a long time, and said slowly, &ldquo;nothing is unexpected now. It is exactly the same as the inscription on the body of the Fulong Ding. If we go on like this, we can only have a complete date of 7749 days. The four spirit blood array, this extraordinary array, will surely succeed! &quot;</p>
<p>The ghost King breathed deeply, his face was red and his eyes were full of rare fanatical light. Step on a step, can&rsquo;t help but howl: &ldquo;good, good, good. I can&rsquo;t wait</p>
<p>Mr. ghost took a look at him and said, &ldquo;master, don&rsquo;t be impatient. Come and say, Fang Chang.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost king looked up at the sky and laughed. He turned around and went to Mr. ghost, but he reached for Mr. ghost and patted him on the shoulder. Mr. ghost seemed to be surprised. He had a strange look in his eyes, but he did not move at last and stood in the same place. A moment later.</p>
<p>The ghost King clapped his hand on his shoulder, but there was no difference. He just laughed and said, &ldquo;OK, OK, OK!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed and was very happy. Then he seemed to think of something. His smile narrowed a little. He said to Mr. ghost, &ldquo;thank you very much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost slightly bowed his head and said, &ldquo;this unique array can succeed. All of them are the patriarch Hong Fu Qi Tian, and if it were not for the Fu Long Ding artifact, I would have nothing to do with it. &quot;</p>
<p>The ghost King smiles and shakes his head and says, &ldquo;the Fulong Ding is a great treasure of our ghost king, but no one has been able to understand the inscriptions on the body of the tripod for many years. It&rsquo;s only you who helped me in the end. This is Mr. Tianjiang. It has become an overlord! &quot;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost was silent for a moment and said, &ldquo;the Lord flatters you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ghost King ha ha ha smile, and turned around, eyes again fell in the void and stand. On the Fulong Ding, which is full of light and auspiciousness, there is a rush of excitement and ecstasy in the eyes, and I can&rsquo;t help laughing again.</p>
<p>Mr. ghost stood quietly behind the ghost king, looking at the ghost King more and more arrogant, without saying a word. At the moment, anyone who comes in here to know the ghost king will be surprised. The ghost king has always been brilliant and reserved. He has never been so arrogant. However, in Mr. GUI&rsquo;s eyes, he is not surprised.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know whether it is Mr. GUI who sees more when he is alone with the ghost king, or whether he is deep in mind and can&rsquo;t be seen by others.</p>
<p>All in all, on the huge blood pool in the hidden mountain, the ghost king was content to calculate the future, and the proud laughter echoed and gradually covered the huge cave. Behind him was a quiet shadow, standing quietly.</p>
<p>Under Qingyun Mountain.</p>
<p>The mysterious dark cloud above the sky has gradually dissipated, but the cloud layer is still very thick. From the dark sky, the heavy rain is still falling, washing the lonely world.</p>
<p>On the wilderness, the wind was swift and the rain was sudden, and the chill was piercing. The place that used to be an abandoned villa not long ago, after a thrilling and fierce fight, has completely become ruins. Even the ground under your feet has turned over due to the destruction of huge magic power. After being washed away by strong winds and heavy rain, it has become dirty mud.</p>
<p>It was dark and there was no light. In the wilderness, in the wind and rain, there is only a faint blue light, flickering slightly.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi, who has always loved to be clean, has been stained with mud in her white clothes, but she seems not to care at all. Not far in front of her, he quietly lay the remains of Tian Buyi. He closed his eyes and was calm as if he were asleep. The wind and rain hit his face, there was a whimper in the wind, it seemed to be crying.</p>
<p>GUI Li still didn&rsquo;t wake up. By the pale blue light of Tianya, you could see that his face was as white as a dead man, and his expression was full of pain. If it was not for the slight fluctuation of breath in his chest, it was almost illusory. At the moment, his body is held in the arms of Lu Xueqi, and Tianya quietly radiates light. In the small place around Lu Xueqi and GUI Li, a small gap is propped up, and the invisible force blocks the raindrops.</p>
<p>Not far in front of them, the monkey Xiaohui also lost its vitality. He sat quietly on the ground. The rain in the sky dampened its body hair. From time to time, drops of water flowed through its face and body to the ground. A gust of cold wind blowing, small ash three eyes are blinking, seems to feel a little cold, quietly close to the ghostly body.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi looks up silently, looks at Xiaohui, then reaches out her hand, gently carries Xiaohui into Tianya aura, and makes it lie on the body of GUI Li. Xiao Hui looks at Lu Xueqi and makes a soft &ldquo;squeak&rdquo; sound in her mouth. Then her head drops down and leans against her ghost sharp chest. It&rsquo;s head side over side, eyes at the front of not far away, the field is not easy to quiet body.</p>
<p>Like a dream? Fantasy?</p>
<p>It seems to be a long and long dream, but there is no half of the joy, because at the end of the day, it turns out to be a nightmare.</p>
<p>The body moved. The sad look on his pale face seemed to be a little deeper. A moment later, with a painful voice, he slowly woke up.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s light in front of you, light blue. Floating around the body.</p>
<p>There is a sound around, is the sound of wind and rain, wind and rain, wind and rain Xiaoxiao.</p>
<p>The small ash leaning on the chest of the ghost suddenly straightened up and looked at the ghost.</p>
<p>Once again, the cold wind blows.</p>
<p>There was a slight shiver. Then he saw Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s eyes, the same pale face as him, the only person to accompany him in this stormy night.</p>
<p>The corner of his mouth trembled slightly.</p>
<p>The pain in his chest had been relieved a lot. He took a fierce look at his chest. He saw that there were seven or eight pieces of white cloth belts of different sizes around his chest. All of them were temporarily torn off from his clothes. At the moment, his consciousness gradually became clear, and he soon noticed the broken bone in his chest wound. They&rsquo;re all connected. However, the power of Tian Bu Yi&rsquo;s palm was really extraordinary. His whole Qi was shaken. Although Lu Xueqi rescued him afterwards, he was afraid that he would have to recuperate for many days.</p>
<p>With this in mind, he subconsciously turned his eyes and soon saw the teacher who raised him. GUI Li didn&rsquo;t speak. He seemed to have no strength to speak. In the wind and rain, Tian Bu Yi&rsquo;s face was splashed with water and lay quietly in the dirty mud.</p>
<p>Who knows. What happens when he dies?</p>
<p>There was a low hoarse cry in his throat. His fierce body rolled down from Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s arms and fell into the mud. Then he struggled to climb to Tian&rsquo;s body. Lu Xueqi was surprised. Instinctively pulled him forward. But when her hand touched the body of GUI Li, she heard a low, low voice</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t pull me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi stood numbly and slowly took back her outstretched hand. Her eyes looked at GUI Li and followed him all the time. She saw that Gui Li left the aura of Tianya and crawled towards Tian Bu Yi&rsquo;s body step by step. The wind and rain are merciless. It was cold, and soon wet his body, all the way up, muddy mud splashed all over his body.</p>
<p>Monkey Xiao Hui followed GUI Li and looked at the master&rsquo;s appearance. He seemed to be worried. From time to time, he jumped to Gui Li and stretched out his hands to pull him. However, compared with Xiao Hui, GUI Li&rsquo;s body was too big for Xiao Hui, and Xiao Hui couldn&rsquo;t make any effort for a moment. He couldn&rsquo;t help but feel a little anxious and made a few squeaks.</p>
<p>Finally, the ghost climbed to the field not easy side, tentacles, already cold. His teeth clenched and his body trembled slightly. His eyes, carefully looked in front of the field is not easy, like years of wandering back, but after all, only despair.</p>
<p>From his face, drops of water, fell on the field is not easy to have rigid face.</p>
<p>The wind and rain are getting worse.</p>
<p>His eyes, slowly fell on the field is not easy chest, although the clothes have been arranged, but the huge terrible wound, still shocking. It was as if the whole person had been stabbed for a while, and his body was frozen.</p>
<p>Then he turned slowly and looked back.</p>
<p>Behind her is Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s lonely and desolate figure. In the wind and rain, she silently met the fierce eyes, her face was bloodless, her hands shrank in the sleeves, tightly clenched into fists, and her nails were deeply embedded in her skin.</p>
<p>That moment of looking at, I do not know how sad?</p>
<p>The expression on the grimace face, gradually lost, even the initial pain and sadness, also gradually disappeared, only at a loss. Also so blankly turned his head, looking at the field is not easy, wind and rain blowing, field is not easy to face, do not know when, splashed on the ground a few mud.</p>
<p>GUI Li slowly stretched out his hand and wiped the rain on his face. When he touched the cold skin on Tian Buyi&rsquo;s face, his hand seemed to be burned by fire. He instinctively drew back and then stretched out again, carefully wiping away the mud and rain on Tian Buyi&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>Then, he stood up, climbed close to the master&rsquo;s body, with his chest, for the field is not easy to block the wind and rain, no longer let the miserable wind and rain, touch his body.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi looked at what he did in silence, without stopping. On her beautiful face, there was only desolation left.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I was a young man, my family was broken.&rdquo; The fierce voice suddenly came from the wind and rain. He spoke slowly, like every word, rolling in his heart for countless times before slowly revealing it.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi quietly approached him, and the body remained motionless, still for the field is not easy to block the wind and rain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s master. He took me back to dazhufeng and taught me to support me. I can&rsquo;t repay his kindness for the rest of my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ghostly body, swayed for a while, I don&rsquo;t know if it is because of fatigue after injury, some can not support. Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s face changed, and she reached out to help him, but her hand just touched the body of GUI Li, who moved a little to the side to avoid her.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s hand was frozen in the air.</p>
<p>He took up Tian Bu Yi&rsquo;s body and held his head and face deeply in his arms. At the same time, a deep pain appeared on his face, and he only whispered in his mouth.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi stood beside him. In the wind and rain, she still heard his words clearly. She just repeated a sentence repeatedly</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never pay it back in my life For a lifetime, I can&rsquo;t pay it back&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s lips, slightly trembling, her eyes, swept over Tian Bu Yi&rsquo;s face, who knows, in this same night, this person has also smile to talk to her, made a promise to her, let her in once despair, saw the glimmer of hope.</p>
<p>That sword, that wound</p>
<p>Injured people, but more than one!</p>
<p>She was sad and smile, turned around, but the body can not help shaking a few times, show eyebrows wrinkled, a mouthful of blood spurted out. Bit by bit, it fell on her chest and clothes, and also fell on the earth, but the wind and rain were merciless, and it did not take long to be eroded by the rain.</p>
<p>She looked up at the sky, the cold rain fell on her face, the sky as black as ink.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it nearly dawn?</p>
<p>In this world, why is the only wind and rain left in the world?</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi tears in the corner of her eyes, quietly sliding in the wind and rain. (to be continued. )</p>
