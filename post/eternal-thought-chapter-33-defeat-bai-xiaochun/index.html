      <p>[broadcast] students who pay attention to &ldquo;starting reading&rdquo; and get the first-hand news of 515 red envelopes can show their skills this time.</p>
<p>Around the outside disciples, as well as those who were eliminated, one by one immediately shared a common hatred against the enemy and roared at Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shameless, Bai Xiaochun, you are so shameless!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t accept such a victory!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down with Bai Xiaochun!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seeing the fierce voice of the crowd, Bai Xiaochun was terrified. He said that even if he lifted the weight lightly, he could not calm down the anger of the people. It is estimated that there will be adverse effects and make people feel more shameless So he quickly looked at elder sun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elder sun, I am the first one. Please announce it quickly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elder sun chuckled bitterly, and Li Qinghou on the other side sighed. He didn&rsquo;t expect that it would be such a result for Bai Xiaochun to participate in the Xiaobi.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Er Well, Xiaobi and Bai Xiaochun are the first! &quot; Elder sun smiles bitterly and shakes his head. When the words come out, people around him glare at Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun thinks that although he is very powerful, so many people When he was about to walk off the stage and leave the dangerous place, Du Lingfei was awakened. She was breathing fast and staring at Bai Xiaochun, and she suddenly clenched her teeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bai Xiaochun, I&rsquo;m not satisfied with Du Lingfei this time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since you have become the first, Du Lingfei will give you this first, but I am not satisfied with you personally. Do you dare to compare with me again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun ha ha ha laughs, the footstep does not stop, thought oneself to have a problem to be able to compare with this crazy woman again, in case the other side faints again how to do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t compete with you. We are all foreign disciples and medicine children of Xiangyun mountain. I compare my accomplishments with you!&rdquo; Du Lingfei stares at Bai Xiaochun, word by word, with determination in her voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you win, you can take away the green pine sword, otherwise, I will not finish with you in the future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun steps a meal, heard than the grass and trees attainments, turned to look at Du Lingfei, hesitated for a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bai Xiaochun, if you can win me in the grass and tree attainments, you can also take this Lingyun incense!&rdquo; Du Lingfei sees Bai Xiaochun stop and sees that Bai Xiaochun is hesitant and shows hatred in her eyes. She even has an impulse to kill Bai Xiaochun. She is afraid that the other party will not dare to compare with her. So she directly takes a green and purple fragrance from her storage bag.</p>
<p>As soon as the incense was taken out, there were bursts of aura scattered. When the disciples of other schools around saw Lingyun incense, they were envious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lingyunxiang, the first-class elixir This is a first-class elixir. It&rsquo;s very valuable. It&rsquo;s very effective for gas condensate below seven layers! &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This should have been prepared by Du Lingfei for breaking through the fifth layer of condensate gas&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elder martial sister Du&rsquo;s attainments in grass and trees are among the top 20 in the three stone steles of Wanyao Pavilion. Bai Xiaochun is sure to lose!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun immediately recognized the lingyunxiang. When explaining a Lingyun herb in the third chapter of the plant, Bai Xiaochun once introduced the efficacy of lingyunxiang, and was immediately moved. Especially when he heard that the other party was in the top 20 of Wanyao Pavilion, his eyes lit up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You Are you really in the top 20 Bai Xiaochun wanted to make sure, and asked a few steps back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you compare it or not?&rdquo; Du Lingfei gritted her teeth and said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I only learned the first three chapters of vegetation&hellip;&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun hesitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Compare with you the first three! Dare you Du Lingfei felt that she was going to explode and roared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Than I can&rsquo;t do better than that. &quot; When Bai Xiaochun heard this, she replied with a sad face, but her heart was full of joy. She felt that she was really stupid.</p>
<p>When they heard Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s words, they immediately yelled, and Du Lingfei also took a deep breath. At the moment, although her aura did not recover much, her physical strength recovered. After a fierce look at Bai Xiaochun, she stepped forward and clasped her fist at elder sun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Disciple Du Lingfei, please witness this battle between Bai Xiaochun and me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For Du Lingfei in front of him, the more he saw it, the better he felt. After hearing the words, he touched his beard and opened his mouth with a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, today I&rsquo;m here to witness. Since I&rsquo;m more accomplished than plants, how about making a topic out of palm seat?&rdquo; Elder sun looked at Li Qinghou.</p>
<p>After hearing the speech, Li Qing looked at Bai Xiaochun deeply, and then nodded.</p>
<p>In this way, the disciples around immediately excited, even Du Lingfei also excited, to Li Qinghou again.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun likes this kind of competition that doesn&rsquo;t have to fight and kill, but can make a show. Standing there at the moment, he no longer has a sad face. Instead, he raises his chin and looks arrogant. The people around him are even more uncomfortable. Du Lingfei also gives him a cold hum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The way of vegetation is unpredictable. Although it is only the content of the first three chapters, there are still many variables. Today, I&rsquo;ll give two questions to see which of you can win.&rdquo; Li Qinghou spoke faintly, glancing at Bai Xiaochun and Du Lingfei. His right hand was raised on the storage bag, and two seeds were already in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have two flower seeds in my hand. With aura as catalyst and with your plant attainments, the one with the most spiritual flowers will win the first round.&rdquo; Li Qinghou shook his right hand, and the two seeds flew to Bai Xiaochun and Du Lingfei respectively.</p>
<p>Du Lingfei catches her. When she is hesitating, Li Qinghou pops up a pill and goes straight to Du Lingfei. She takes it and is stunned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This Dan can restore your accomplishments in an instant.&rdquo; When Li Qinghou&rsquo;s voice was quiet, Du Lingfei was immediately surprised. After thanking him, she quickly swallowed it, that is, several breathing time. Her whole body was shocked, and her eyes showed a smart light. In this instant, her internal cultivation recovered.</p>
<p>When Bai Xiaochun saw this scene, she felt a little angry, but she didn&rsquo;t dare to say anything. She looked at the spirit seeds in the heart of her eyes and hands. Instead of catalyzing them immediately, she took them in front of her eyes and carefully identified them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t recognize it, I can tell you directly that this is the seed of lanlinghua.&rdquo; Du Lingfei takes a contemptuous look at Bai Xiaochun and ignores it. With her eyes closed, the aura in her body suddenly moves into her hands and runs straight to the influx of seeds.</p>
<p>Soon, the seeds in her hand gave out green buds and grew rapidly. After a blue spirit flower was opened, the spirit plant continued to grow.</p>
<p>At this time, Bai Xiaochun took back her eyes and looked at the seed, thinking.</p>
<p>Li Qinghou has been observing Bai Xiaochun all the time. When he sees this behind the scenes, a touch of surprise is revealed in his eyes.</p>
<p>In the process of Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s meditation, all the other disciples around looked at Du Lingfei and saw the spirit plant in her hand. At this moment, she grew to two feet high and opened a second flower.</p>
<p>When Du Lingfei&rsquo;s spirit plant opened the third word, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s spirit moved and went straight to the seed inflow, not to maintain stability, but to intermittently. Even after the seeds germinated, he still blew a breath to blow the pieces away.</p>
<p>As time went by, Du Lingfei was pale after a stick of incense. However, she bit her teeth fiercely. She opened six blue flowers in one breath. She was relieved. She put Lingzhi aside and waited for Li Qing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are six spiritual flowers, which can be regarded as excellent, good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li Qinghou nodded.</p>
<p>Du Lingfei is satisfied in her heart. When she looks at Bai Xiaochun, she finds that the spirit plant in the other party&rsquo;s hands is less than a foot, and her eyes are more scornful.</p>
<p>Those outside disciples around are all excited at the moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really elder martial sister Du. It&rsquo;s extraordinary to see six blue flowers bloom. Bai Xiaochun doesn&rsquo;t have any flowers at the moment. It&rsquo;s a waste.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This kind of catalytic test, first of all, is to observe what kind of seeds, and then to catalyze according to the growth law of different seeds. Sister Du has already made a great contribution in this respect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they were talking, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s spirit plant gradually reached a foot high. Then, a little shriveled blue flower came out. Compared with Du Lingfei&rsquo;s blue flower, it seemed that she was malnourished. When people wanted to laugh at her, suddenly, it was one foot high, but a second blue flower bloomed, followed by the third, fourth, fifth and sixth Flower, seventh</p>
<p>Just a few breathing time, white Xiaochun hands of the spirit plant, actually appeared a whole nine!!</p>
<p>This scene, let the people around all surprised, have incredible carefully look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lanling flower is one foot and one flower. How can it be one foot and nine flowers?&rdquo; Du Lingfei was also stunned for a moment, feeling that this matter was bizarre.</p>
<p>But all this is not over, just after the nine blue flowers appeared, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s eyes flashed, took a deep breath, and suddenly vomited out. This breath contains spiritual breath, and falls on the nine flowers. In a blink of an eye, the nine flowers tremble together. The color changes to the naked eye and becomes blue directly!</p>
<p>Blue is better than blue!</p>
<p>&ldquo;This This is not a blue flower Around the crowd, suddenly someone recognized, with wide eyes, with shock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Qingling flower, it is almost impossible to identify different Qingling flowers from lanlinghua when they are in seeds, and their catalytic methods are completely different. If the catalysis is carried out according to the blue spirit flower, the blue spirit flower will appear, and the flower seeds will be wasted!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everyone was surprised. When they looked at Bai Xiaochun, they couldn&rsquo;t believe it.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun opened her eyes at the moment and put the green flower in her hand aside. She laughed and looked at Du Lingfei with her hands on her back.</p>
<p>He has reached an indescribable level of attainments in plants. If you look at it carefully, you can immediately see the difference. The recognition of this degree is very simple for him.</p>
<p>Du Lingfei&rsquo;s face changed. She felt that she had been slapped in the face. She stepped back a few steps and looked at her own blue flower and her white little green flower. She only felt that her face was hot. She just went to point out her arrogant advice. In a flash, everything proved that she had wasted her flower seeds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bai Xiaochun must be lucky. What I see is Lanling, and what he sees is Qingling. This must be the reason, not that he can recognize it!&rdquo; Du Lingfei clenched her teeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the first round, Bai Xiaochun won. The flower is not Lanling, but Qingling. It looks the same, but the patterns are slightly different. It&rsquo;s hard to find and confuse if you don&rsquo;t go into details.&rdquo; Li Qinghou opened his mouth faintly. Seeing Xiaochun&rsquo;s white eyes, he raised his right hand and a spirit grass appeared in his hand.</p>
<p>The spirit grass is very special. It has four colors. Nine leaves are different. It has two flowers. One is black and the other is white. It seems to have spirituality. It shakes and bumps against each other. It seems that it wants to suppress each other. The appearance is integrated. If you look carefully, you can find some traces of grafting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first round is about catalysis. In the second round, the examiner will identify it. The plant in my hand is grafted by many kinds of spiritual grasses. If you name the correct number, the one with the largest number will win.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li Qinghou floated the spirit grass in front of him, and his eyes fell on Bai Xiaochun. He wanted to see if the child who had been brought into the clan could continue to surprise himself.</p>
<p>Du Lingfei bit her silver teeth. She felt that she had been negligent before. Now she was more serious than ever. She took out a jade slip and went to lingcao.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun showed interest in her eyes and walked over. They looked carefully for a long time, recording on the jade slips from time to time. After a moment, Du Lingfei rubbed her eyebrows and stepped back. She looked at Bai Xiaochun with a gloomy face. She could see eight kinds of them. She could not recognize the others as long as she could.</p>
<p>However, Bai Xiaochun didn&rsquo;t finish the observation. Instead, her eyes gradually glowed, and she even made a sound. She walked around lingcao for several times, sometimes exclaiming, as if she had found something surprising.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can it still be like this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is Interesting! &quot;</p>
<p>All around them were silent and looked at Bai Xiaochun. They did not believe that Bai Xiaochun had recognized Bai Xiaochun by his ability. Most of them thought that Bai Xiaochun was lucky and directly acted as Qingling flower.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretend, you keep on pretending!&rdquo; Du Lingfei is not satisfied with the bottom of her heart. The more she looks at Bai Xiaochun, the more disgusted she feels.</p>
<p>As time went by, Bai Xiaochun was still not over after a stick of incense. He was really thoroughly involved and forgot that he was still in the competition. The grafted spirit grass seemed to open another door to Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s attainments in plants, making the tens of thousands of herbs he mastered no longer exist alone, but merged in the back of his head.</p>
<p>For a long time, Bai Xiaochun reluctantly retreated, looking at the lingcao, his eyes showed obsession and admiration.</p>
<p>Li Qinghou and elder sun looked at each other, and suddenly Li Qinghou opened his mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now you two, tell us the spirit grass you recognize, Du Lingfei, you come first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Du Lingfei gritted her teeth, took out the jade slips, and opened her mouth first.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can only see eight kinds of them. They are water sky pattern, one cold root, earthworm fruit and morning mist grass Finally, it is the Loess essence! &quot; After that, Du Lingfei looks at Bai Xiaochun. She doesn&rsquo;t believe that Bai Xiaochun can surpass herself. To know that although eight kinds of herbs seem to be few, they are actually very difficult to identify on nearly perfectly grafted herbs. There are quite a few of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hum, if Bai Xiaochun also shamelessly said that there are eight kinds of jade slips, then jade slips can be used as evidence!&rdquo; Du Lingfei sneered.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun coughed and saw that everyone was looking at him. So he swung his sleeve and took out the jade slips that had just recorded lingcao.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to talk about eight kinds of elder martial sister Du. In addition, the students can see 67 kinds of herbs. Unfortunately, there are 31 kinds that I don&rsquo;t know, and only 36 kinds can be recognized.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun has just said this, but before he has finished, all the disciples around him are out of breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sixty seven, how could that be possible?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This kind of identification, can recognize seven or eight kinds is the limit, how can we recognize dozens of them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Du Lingfei stares at Bai Xiaochun with a sneer. She doesn&rsquo;t believe what the other side says. At the moment, she concludes that Bai Xiaochun is going to blind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Younger martial brother Bai, why don&rsquo;t you say there are 30000 kinds of plants? If you recite the first three chapters of plants, you will surely get a lot of correct answers.&rdquo; Du Lingfei sneered.</p>
<p>Do you still have free appreciation tickets and starting coins for the children&rsquo;s shoes who are chasing the watch? The countdown of the 515 red envelope list is on. I&rsquo;ll draw a ticket, ask for the increase and appreciation ticket, and finally flush it!</p>
