      <p>&ldquo;Get out of my way! &ldquo;The Lich was silent for a long time and said slowly.</p>
<p>The evil spirit looked at him coldly and said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you regret before the goddess statue? &quot;</p>
<p>The Lich&rsquo;s black clothes moved slightly again. It seemed that he was very excited under the black clothes. However, he did not look back to see the stone statue woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m right. My mother is wrong! &ldquo;He said in an astringent voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roar! &quot;</p>
<p>The ferocious spirit roared furiously, whistling like thunder in the sky, and fell on the earth in an instant. The sand flying stones from far and near went straight: &ldquo;beast! You shameless man, how dare you say such a thing! &quot;</p>
<p>The gold vase in the distance frowned and couldn&rsquo;t help covering her ears. After such a long distance, she couldn&rsquo;t hear the black and white conversation. However, the sudden burst of the evil spirit was almost like thunder in her ear, which made her ears buzzing.</p>
<p>In the distance, the Lich was covered with black veil and could not see his expression. However, when he only heard his voice, it became more and more desolate and painful: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m right, I&rsquo;m right &quot;</p>
<p>He murmured to himself, not knowing whether it was to the evil spirit or to himself, or to the stone statue behind him!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hei mu, please kneel down in front of the statue of the goddess. If you stop your wishful thinking, we will still be brothers. Otherwise, from now on, you will not blame me for being ruthless. &quot;</p>
<p>The Lich shook, looked up and said, &ldquo;do you still recognize me as a brother? &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! &ldquo;The evil spirit cried out,&rdquo; as long as you break your infatuation and plead guilty to the goddess, and then wait with me for your mother and guard the ancient cave of the town, you black wood will always be my brother! &quot;</p>
<p>The Lich&rsquo;s black clothes fluttered with the wind, and his inner excitement was faintly felt. However, after only a moment, his body gradually calmed down, and the whole person was silent. And the evil spirit looked at him. Originally looking forward to the expression, finally turned to a deeper anger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you look back? &ldquo;The evil spirit roared.</p>
<p>The Lich&rsquo;s voice at the moment had completely calmed down, just like his usual tone. &ldquo;I have no turning back,&rdquo; he said quietly. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roar! &ldquo;The evil spirit roared, and the huge sword was cut off in the sky and waved in front of the Lich. In an instant, the sand was flying, and the land near and far seemed to shake.</p>
<p>The Golden Vase changes color. The evil spirit was still in her imagination.</p>
<p>He just looked at the Lich without any fear. He looked at the evil spirit coldly and said, &ldquo;brother &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut up, I&rsquo;m not your elder brother! &quot;</p>
<p>The Lich said faintly, &ldquo;even if you don&rsquo;t recognize me, I still recognize that you will always be my elder brother. But at that time, it was my mother&rsquo;s fault. Now, I want to do her unfinished work for her! &quot;</p>
<p>The evil spirit became more and more angry and said, &ldquo;are you crazy? &quot;</p>
<p>The Lich took a deep breath and said, &ldquo;even if I&rsquo;m crazy. I will do it too! &quot;</p>
<p>After that, he was floating in the magic cave. The evil spirit was obviously extremely angry. With a roar, the huge sword beheaded the Lich. The power of this sword is more powerful than just now. The stone walls of the whole cave are shaking, and they look like they are going to collapse.</p>
<p>Seeing from afar, the Golden Vase still can&rsquo;t help worrying about the lich, but the Lich has not entered the ancient cave. The figure is blocked by the stone wall, and the action of how to fight with the evil spirit is invisible.</p>
<p>In the ancient cave, after the rising sand and stone fall. The evil spirit roared, but the Lich&rsquo;s figure had disappeared.</p>
<p>Only in the deep darkness of the ancient cave came the voice of the Lich: &ldquo;brother, you have been a great hero before and after death, but we are all the same people now. Why do you have to &quot;</p>
<p>The fierce spirit roared and howled, as if there was a burning fire in the heart.</p>
<p>There was silence in the ancient cave, and it was obvious that the Lich had gone far away.</p>
<p>The evil spirit was silent. After a moment, he slowly turned to the stone statue at the entrance of the ancient cave. The huge white body slowly twisted, and the white air, like smoke, was lingering around the stone statue woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother &quot;</p>
<p>Low choking, from the desolation and vicissitudes of life, with a faint trace of helplessness, quietly reverberates between heaven and earth. And his figure, also gradually dispersed, in the dark wind slowly disappeared.</p>
<p>In front of the ancient cave, it was calm again, as if nothing had happened. Only the stone statue of the woman still stands there quietly, and there is the never-ending bleak whistling from the depths of the ancient cave of demons.</p>
<p>The voice, as if more desolate.</p>
<p>Middle Earth, South, huqishan.</p>
<p>Under the desolate mountains, there is the general Hall of the ghost King sect of the demon sect. Countless demon sect disciples are busy in and out of it.</p>
<p>In the deepest part of this place, in the huge natural cave, the ghost king stood on the platform without expression and looked at the two ancient strange animals in the blood pool below.</p>
<p>Kui Niu soaked in blood and water, motionless, even the eyes also appear dim down. The yellow bird, who was struggling for a while ago, seems to be under the pressure of some strange force, and his spirit is also put down. He is quietly immersed in the water of blood and does not move.</p>
<p>The Fulong tripod, which is hanging in the air, twinkles with red light and slowly rotates, casting out red light curtains to cover Kui cattle and yellow birds.</p>
<p>The strong smell of blood filled the cave.</p>
<p>The shadow suddenly flashed, the most mysterious ghost gentleman in the ghost King clan flew up and appeared beside the ghost king.</p>
<p>The ghost king looked at him and said, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter? &quot;</p>
<p>Mr. GUI&rsquo;s appearance is somewhat similar to the mysterious figure Lich in southern Xinjiang. They are all dressed in black and covered with black gauze, but their voice sounds older.</p>
<p>At the moment, he moved his black veil and nodded slightly. He said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s almost done. Kui Niu is subdued. The yellow bird can return to the array within three days. The blood array of four spirits has become half. &quot;</p>
<p>The ghost king did not speak and nodded slowly.</p>
<p>Mr. ghost said, &ldquo;no matter what the right way is, half the power of the four spirits blood array is enough to wipe out the Wandu sect and the Huan sect. &quot;</p>
<p>The ghost King took a look at him and said slowly, &ldquo;what I want to deal with is the sword array of killing immortals in Qingyun gate. &quot;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost was silent.</p>
<p>The ghost king turned around and slowly walked away. At the same time, he said, &ldquo;I will speed up the search for the other two spirit beasts. Please do what&rsquo;s going on here. &quot;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost looked at the figure from behind, and his eyes flashed. He didn&rsquo;t know what he was thinking.</p>
<p>After a long time, he turned to meditate. Suddenly, with a sigh, the figure flashed and flew to the blood pool below.</p>
<p>In the ancient grottoes, the smell of blood suddenly became strong again.</p>
<p>The ghost king came out of the ancient cave of blood pool. He walked with his hands down and walked down the long corridor to a crossroad. After hesitating for a moment, a trace of sadness flashed on his face. Turn around and walk down the road to the right.</p>
<p>Along the way, many of them met the disciples of the ghost King sect. When they saw the ghost king, they bowed their heads and saluted one after another. The ghost king did not pay any attention to it. So they walked slowly through the road until the end of the road, which was the cold stone room.</p>
<p>He stood in front of the door, originally as stable as Mount Tai, but suddenly seemed to be a lot older. A low sigh. He pushed open the stone gate and went in.</p>
<p>A gust of cold air rushed to his face, and the ghost King closed the stone gate with his backhand. The cold stone room is not big, and its furnishings are extremely simple. Only a cold stone platform in the middle of the stone room, whose face is so white that there is no trace of blood color, lies quietly on it, hands on the chest, holding the golden &ldquo;joyous bell.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>A woman. Sitting by her side in silence, gazing at her.</p>
<p>The ghost king went up, his eyes fell on his beloved daughter&rsquo;s face, and the corners of his eyes twitched suddenly. Even the hands behind him couldn&rsquo;t help holding tightly.</p>
<p>Ten years, ten years.</p>
<p>In the past ten years, he had hardly a day when he was not sad for his daughter, so that he even deliberately reduced the frequency of visiting Biyao to avoid being unable to extricate himself.</p>
<p>The only and beloved daughter</p>
<p>His voice also became deep and hoarse: &ldquo;Youji. You let me and Yao&rsquo;er stay alone for a while. &quot;</p>
<p>Youji slowly stood up, turned around, slightly saluted the ghost king, and then walked out.</p>
<p>The ghost King glanced at her figure and said nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bang. &quot;</p>
<p>A low sound, the stone door opened and closed, cold stone room, only the father and daughter.</p>
<p>The ghost King sat down slowly beside Bi Yao.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yao&rsquo;er, my father hasn&rsquo;t come to see you for a long time. Are you angry with me His deep voice echoed quietly in the stone chamber, with endless sorrow.</p>
<p>Only Biyao, still so calm and calm lying.</p>
<p>The ghost King gazed at the beautiful face and was in a trance. &ldquo;You and your mother look like each other! Even his temper is the same. You know, Yao&rsquo;er &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When your mother died, I didn&rsquo;t see her last time, but I know she entrusted you to me. For many years, I was afraid of being bad to you, and I would never have the face to see your mother again. But But &quot;</p>
<p>This person, who makes countless people fear and resent in the world today, even his voice trembles slightly at the moment. He says that he has said countless times in the past ten years, saying, &ldquo;Why are you so stupid &quot;</p>
<p>Biyao silent, still quietly lying in front of him, in her pale face, can not see the slightest pain and sadness, on the contrary, there is a faint smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yao er &ldquo;The ghost king gave a low cry and said nothing more.</p>
<p>He just sat quietly with his only beloved daughter.</p>
<p>Until, on the stone door of the cold stone room, suddenly came a knock on the door.</p>
<p>The ghost King frowned and the murderous spirit flashed in his eyes. In the past ten years, no one dared to disturb him when he accompanied his daughter. As for GUI Li, in his eyes, there has always been only a bi Yao, but the ghost king did not say anything to him.</p>
<p>But now the ghost is not here, but some people dare to commit the ghost King&rsquo;s taboo, it is rare. The ghost King snorted, stood up, gently wiped a little bit of tears from the corners of his eyes with his sleeve robe, and breathed deeply. When he turned around again, he was already the ghost king who was awed by countless people.</p>
<p>He walked slowly to the door, opened the stone door, and went out.</p>
<p>Outside the door, there is only one person - Qinglong.</p>
<p>The ghost King frowned. Qinglong was the first of the four holy envoys of the ghost King clan in the last generation, and he was also his strong arm and confidant. Moreover, he has always been cautious and will never disturb him with Biyao without authorization.</p>
<p>It seems that something big has happened.</p>
<p>The ghost king looked at it with his eyes, and the green dragon whispered, &ldquo;the news has come back from the south of Xinjiang.&rdquo;. &quot;</p>
<p>The ghost King frowned and said, &ldquo;what? &quot;</p>
<p>Qinglong glanced at the ghost king and said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s said that Gui Li has found someone who knows the magic of resurrection, and has taken him back with him. &quot;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very important thing. The king of ghosts was so calm and cultivated that he could not help but take a step forward and say, &ldquo;really? &quot;</p>
<p>Qinglong nodded and sighed in his heart. He was deeply in love. No one can give up.</p>
<p>The ghost king looked up at the sky, deeply inhaled, calmed down his excited mood, but his hands were still slightly shaking. &ldquo;Who is that man? How did you find him? &quot;</p>
<p>Qinglong said, &ldquo;that man is a great wizard of the Miao nationality among the five ethnic groups in the southern frontier. As for how GUI Li knows that he has the magic of resurrection, I don&rsquo;t know. &quot;</p>
<p>The ghost King nodded, &ldquo;it doesn&rsquo;t matter. As long as he can save Yao&rsquo;er, he can save Yao&rsquo;er &ldquo;I wish that the great wizard and the devil would come to him at the moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many days have they been gone? How long can they get here? &ldquo;The ghost king asked.</p>
<p>Qinglong said, &ldquo;the news was brought back by Gui Li&rsquo;s spies in the south. It is said that the great wizard was seriously injured and could not fly, so he had to walk slowly.</p>
<p>&quot;</p>
<p>The ghost king was stunned and said, &ldquo;seriously injured, what&rsquo;s going on? &quot;</p>
<p>Qinglong said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s said that the injuries were caused by the internal strife among the five ethnic groups in southern Xinjiang. In addition,&rdquo; he hesitated for a moment. He said, &ldquo;it seems that Gui Li has been hurt a lot, and it&rsquo;s in the right hands. &quot;</p>
<p>The ghost King&rsquo;s eyes congealed and said, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter? &quot;</p>
<p>Qinglong shook his head and said, &ldquo;the specific situation is not clear. The area of Southern Xinjiang has always been the place where the power of burning incense Valley is located. It&rsquo;s very difficult for our people to get in. If we are careful, we&rsquo;ll have to wait for GUI Li to come back and ask again. However, there in the south, the second white tiger has always been in charge of it, and this news also came back from him. But in his words, it seems &quot;</p>
<p>The ghost king said coldly, &ldquo;what did the white tiger say? &quot;</p>
<p>Qinglong was silent for a moment and said, &ldquo;white tiger mentioned it. And the ghost Li returned together, there is a fox, a woman. &quot;</p>
<p>The ghost King&rsquo;s face changed.</p>
<p>Qinglong took a look at the ghost king, and slowly continued: &ldquo;in addition, white tiger specially mentioned a point in the news. It&rsquo;s the monkey around GUI Li. It seems different. &quot;</p>
<p>The ghost King&rsquo;s eyes flashed, and after a long time, he slowly said, &ldquo;three eyed monkey, have you opened your eyes? &quot;</p>
<p>Qinglong is silent and does not speak.</p>
<p>Outside the cold stone room. Suddenly calm down, the ghost King slowly turned around, his eyes fell on the stone door. His eyes, as if through the thick stone door, saw the quiet woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yao&rsquo;er, are you looking at the father &quot;</p>
<p>Ghost king in the heart, so leisurely read a sentence.</p>
<p>A hundred thousand mountains, an ancient cave.</p>
<p>The Golden Vase moved quietly and approached the entrance of the mysterious and gloomy cave.</p>
<p>At the moment, the Lich had been in for a long time, and the evil spirit had disappeared. There was no more appearance. The whole cave was cold and silent. Only the wind blowing from the hole was still howling.</p>
<p>Gradually, the Golden Vase approached the stone statue woman. She approached cautiously, and it was quiet all around, until she came three feet in front of the stone statue woman. There was only the wind howling and nothing was moving.</p>
<p>Gold bottle son suddenly feel, seem to hear the sound of his heartbeat.</p>
<p>She calmed down and looked around carefully, especially at the ancient cave of the town of demons. There was a dark one, which was like a terror demon hidden in the darkness. It opened its vicious mouth and growled incessantly.</p>
<p>Jin pinger&rsquo;s eyebrows wrinkled slightly. She intuitively felt that the evil spirit was surging into the sky in the darkness, which made her Qi and blood recoil, which was really hard for her. But at the moment, her curiosity is far better than others. The stone statue of the woman is really a mysterious existence in her heart. In any case, she should have a good look at this stone statue.</p>
<p>The next moment, her eyes fell on the stone statue.</p>
<p>This is a beautiful woman! Gold bottle son in the heart so gently read a sentence.</p>
<p>Graceful eyebrow, thin horizontal in her eyes, melon seed general face, there is a slightly rigid line. Her lips are pursed, her eyes are determined, like after a thousand calamities, she finally made a decision. But her face, her expression, it is strange gentle, a little sad, a little sour.</p>
<p>Thousands of years of wind and frost, can you erase the beauty?</p>
<p>Who are you standing alone in the years?</p>
<p>Jin pinger looks silently, slowly reaches out her hand and touches the stone statue woman. Hun doesn&rsquo;t notice. Behind her, just at the moment her hand touches the stone statue, suddenly white gas comes out, gradually condenses, and gradually converges into human form, showing the evil spirit.</p>
<p>Under the bottom of the hand, it turned out to be rough stones, the scars of countless years of wind and snow, wind and rain, as if under the White Golden Vase, one by one revealed, from the stone statue, the palm of her hand to her heart.</p>
<p>What kind of woman is this woman?</p>
<p>Gold Vase son actually seems to be crazy general, was deeply attracted by that woman stone statue.</p>
<p>Behind his back, the evil spirit appeared completely, and his face was angry. The huge sword was held high. Suddenly, he drank a lot and cut it off! (to be continued. )</p>
