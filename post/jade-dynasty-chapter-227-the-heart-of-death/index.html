      <p>&ldquo;Tut &ldquo;A hoarse and strange smile came from the mysterious man, who awoke them for a moment.&rdquo; goodbye, master and apprentice. It&rsquo;s really moving! &quot;</p>
<p>GUI Li took a long breath. No matter what, although he was excited, elated, surprised, and many doubts were pouring in at the moment, after all, he was not an ignorant young man at that time, and soon calmed down his mind. However, he could not help looking at the field and feeling mixed in his heart.</p>
<p>Tian Buyi was shocked. However, his experience was much more than that of the ghost. He calmed down and turned to be solemn. He turned to the mysterious figure with black air and said, &ldquo;they are both disciples of Qingyun sect. Since you dare to do these things, don&rsquo;t you dare to see them? &quot;</p>
<p>He was stunned, and his eyes fell on the mysterious figure. Obviously, he didn&rsquo;t expect that the man was related to Qingyun gate. However, after a while, he could not help but move his face and looked at Tian Bu Yi, showing a complex look on his face.</p>
<p>At the moment, Lu Xueqi, standing on the side of her mouth, smiles slightly and looks at GUI Li. She seems to feel her eyes, and the ghost Li also looks at her. Lu Xueqi smiles with tenderness in her eyes, which is like comfort and joy.</p>
<p>Sure enough, the mysterious man sneered twice, pointed to the devil and said, &ldquo;why, is he a disciple of Qingyun sect? &quot;</p>
<p>Tian Buyi said decidedly, &ldquo;he is the seventh disciple of my Dazhu peak seat. He is what I Tian Buyi said. How about it? Senior brother daoxuan &quot;</p>
<p>The ghost sharp body a shock, the expression on the face for a time is difficult to describe, the pole of astonishment. After a long time, his eyes moved from Tian Buyi to the mysterious figure. He said in disbelief, &ldquo;Taoist immortal? &quot;</p>
<p>The mysterious figure laughed, and the black air that enveloped him suddenly rolled up and slowly spread down, slowly revealing his body above his chest. However, he was not the famous master of Qingyun sect who had a long beard and caressed his chest. Who is it?</p>
<p>This short moment, the ghost can be said to be a few startled, at this moment to see the face of the real man daoxuan, can not help but step back. For a while, my mind was in a mess, but my mind was blank. Although Lu Xueqi had been prepared in her heart, she could not help but feel shocked and pale when she saw the real face that she had regarded as a God for many years.</p>
<p>At the moment, daoxuan&rsquo;s face remains unchanged.</p>
<p>But at a glance, it can be clearly seen that his expression is quite different from that of the past. The cold light in his eyes twinkles, and there is not a trace of benevolence and compassion that he once had.</p>
<p>GUI Li looked up and down at the real man daoxuan, his eyebrows gradually wrinkled, and the sharp light in his eyes flashed by. The man in front of him can be said to be an important person who has changed his life. Ten years ago, the earth shaking sword of killing immortals in Tongtian peak of Qingyun Mountain sent the soul flying. Zhang Xiaofan has also split into today&rsquo;s ghost.</p>
<p>However, GUI Li deeply understood the depth of daoxuan real man&rsquo;s Taoism. He had already understood that if he only studied the Taoism of Qingyun sect and the magic power of Tianyin temple, he would not be the opponent of the killing immortal sword array if he only studied the Taoism of Qingyun sect and the magic power of Tianyin temple. However, the more he practiced hard, he became more and more aware of Taoism and supernatural powers. However, his hope in his heart was gradually fading. Especially after ten years, when the beast demon was devastated, immortal daoxuan made another attack on Qingyun Mountain. Open the lock of heaven and earth, relying on the aura of heaven and earth, to defeat the once invincible beast God, which is like the God of heaven. It&rsquo;s beyond human power.</p>
<p>However, he never dreamed that he had ever met such a Taoist immortal, a man with terrible Demon power all over his body. Although his practice is also unfathomable, he seems to be within reach of the ghost.</p>
<p>On his face. There was a glimmer of excitement.</p>
<p>The real man daoxuan suddenly turned back and stared at the ghost. The cold light flashed in his eyes.</p>
<p>He presided over the Qingyun gate for more than a hundred years and was famous all over the world. When GUI Li was still Zhang Xiaofan, he really regarded daoxuan as a God. At the moment, he was so suddenly seen that he felt a little nervous in his heart, and subconsciously clenched his fist in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want to kill me? &ldquo;Immortal daoxuan stared at the ghost and said coldly.</p>
<p>GUI Li didn&rsquo;t speak. He just flipped his hand and the green light flashed. The magic wand had already appeared in his hand. It was light and clear, mixed with a few poignant blood red color, flowing slowly.</p>
<p>For some reason, immortal daoxuan looked at the Soul Eater in Gui Li&rsquo;s hand, and his mouth seemed to be sarcastic. Then he turned his head and asked Zhutian the same question: &ldquo;are you going to kill me? &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you kill me? &quot;</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi snorted and said, &ldquo;if you can&rsquo;t kill it, you have to kill it! &quot;</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan chuckled a few times, and his voice was sharp. He said, &ldquo;yes, I saw that in those years, except me and the dead ghost Wan Jian Yi, you are indeed the first person in the generation under Qingyun gate, regardless of talent and courage. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use of talking about these now?&rdquo; he said? &quot;</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan raised his eyebrows and suddenly cried out, &ldquo;OK, I&rsquo;ll ask you why you killed me? &quot;</p>
<p>The field is not easy the body one shakes, unexpectedly cannot say a word for a moment.</p>
<p>On the face of daoxuan, there was a sense of sadness, which was not compatible with his ferocious attitude at the moment. However, he appeared on his face and heard him say coldly, &ldquo;younger martial brother Tian, you are going to kill me, but for the sake of the justice and morality that you have always respected, and the justice of the people? &quot;</p>
<p>This is the first time that Tian Buyi has heard him call himself &ldquo;younger martial brother Tian&rdquo;. For a moment, he felt a little confused. However, he immediately gritted his teeth and said, &ldquo;after you are possessed by the devil, do evil. I will not kill you. I&rsquo;m afraid you will commit more and more crimes! &quot;</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan gave a long cry, and there seemed to be endless sarcasm in his voice. Then he looked at him and said, &ldquo;what a righteous word. I ask you, do you remember why I have become so today? &quot;</p>
<p>The field is not easy to be astonished, speechless.</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan snorted, glanced at Lu Xueqi, who was standing on guard. He said, &ldquo;you martial uncle, you don&rsquo;t want to say anything. Can you tell me? &quot;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s face turned white again, but subconsciously she heard daoxuan&rsquo;s eyes and was silent.</p>
<p>Yes, what can I say? Is it true that ten years ago, for the sake of the world&rsquo;s justice, ten years later, for the sake of the vast human being, immortal XuanZhen twice drove the immortal killing array, and even this?</p>
<p>This is cause and effect. Right and wrong, right and wrong, so entangled, so difficult to distinguish, heaven, even so!</p>
<p>Inside the abandoned villa. For a moment, his momentum was completely captured by immortal daoxuan. Tian Buyi was originally righteous and determined to sacrifice his life for righteousness. However, although immortal daoxuan was possessed by demons, his magical power cultivation did not decline. It seems that he is very clear even though he is wise and intelligent. After a few words, Tian is not easy to be said that he is shaking slightly, but he can&rsquo;t do it for a moment.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, not only does Tian not have a clear mind, but also Lu Xueqi has a clear and clear mind. If this matter is seriously taken into account, daoxuan is a real man in the world. There are a few merits of reconstruction. To do Pingyue, it is not too much to set up a monument for his statue. It&rsquo;s just heaven&rsquo;s trickery, but it&rsquo;s just like this. If daoxuan is delirious after being possessed by demons and kills them wildly, Tian Buyi and others don&rsquo;t have to think about most of them even if they are defeated. But this time, the real man daoxuan clearly asked them a few words and immediately ran them out.</p>
<p>The truth of the world. But I don&rsquo;t know what to do?</p>
<p>At this time, the ghost said coldly, &ldquo;the world&rsquo;s creatures have nothing to do with me. What kind of merit have you done. I don&rsquo;t care. I only ask you for the sword that killed Biyao ten years ago! &quot;</p>
<p>Before the sound falls, the soul swallowing blue light is flourishing. In an instant, the cold breath comes from all directions, filling the inside and outside of the villa. There was a sharp scream in mid air. GUI Li is a magic weapon to control the movement. It comes straight from the middle gate.</p>
<p>Daoxuan&rsquo;s face changed slightly. It seems that he didn&rsquo;t expect the spirit to be fierce. In the past ten years, daoxuan&rsquo;s Taoism was so advanced. Just seeing his move, he seemed to be slow and urgent. It was dark with the heat of wind and thunder. The green light gate was shining. It was the great Xuanqing Taoist method of Qingyun gate, and its realm, surprisingly, had broken through the Yuqing realm and cultivated the supernatural power of Shangqing. Moreover, from the perspective of daoxuan immortal, this son is in the realm of Shangqing. It seems that he has reached the peak of perfection, and has the potential to approach the legendary realm of Qing Dynasty.</p>
<p>In the eyes of Taoist immortal daoxuan, Tian Buyi and Lu Xueqi, standing on one side, are both skilled figures in Qingyun gate. At this glance, both of them are slightly changed. They can&rsquo;t help but look at each other, and then they can see the astonishment in each other&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>Just Tian Bu Yi&rsquo;s eyes are more surprised. In Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s eyes, after the surprise, there is a faint disappointment, but even though she is overwhelmed by a burst of joy.</p>
<p>Naturally, the three of them did not know that Gui Li has suffered many ups and downs over the years, but it is also a coincidence that he is the only one in the world who has mastered the first wonder book of heaven and earth, namely, the book of heaven. The source of the book is mysterious and has been handed down from ancient times. Among them, magical methods and magical powers have changed immeasurably. Under a detailed count, most of the most prosperous Xiuzhen sects in the world are related to this book About the book, all kinds of magic power of Tianyin Temple originated from the fourth volume of the book of heaven. All kinds of magic arts of the demon sect have always been circulated from the book of heaven. However, GUI Li alone practiced four volumes, and his divine power cultivation at the moment can be imagined.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that although GUI Li is not the same as he used to be, the real daoxuan man he is facing is a top-ranking figure in the world. If he wants to control the powerful sword array of killing immortals in Qingyun Mountain, he must practice Taiji Xuanqing to the realm of Taiqing. At this moment, people can really see his power.</p>
<p>With the wind and thunder, the seemingly unstoppable soul swallowing magic wand, before reaching the body, the dark air of immortal daoxuan began to roll rapidly. It seemed that he was forced by giant force and was about to disperse. However, after the initial surprise, immortal daoxuan recovered as usual and stood still. However, his right hand suddenly extended out of the black air. His long five fingers were in front of him and his sword formula was put out. He pointed like the wind. The same green light flashed over his fingers. In a moment, a picture of yin and Yang Tai Chi was drawn.</p>
<p>Once the yin-yang diagram is formed, it will rotate endlessly. In the surrounding half sky, the wind is rushing and the surrounding area is dark. Only this pattern is bright. In a short time, a whirlpool of rapidly rotating air currents is formed in the mid air.</p>
<p>The great pole figure is in the way. They collide with each other. It seems that they are irresistible. But at the moment of the collision, there is no sound except for a small &ldquo;hissing&rdquo; in the air.</p>
<p>I saw that Taiji Tu Shengsheng was pushed back three feet by soul swallowing. However, the three feet distance exhausted all the attacking power of soul eating and was unable to move forward any more. Moreover, the blue light gradually faded, and there was a tendency to rotate with the whirlpool.</p>
<p>With a long scream, the ghost leaped up into the air, and the aura flashed and flew back. Immortal daoxuan squinted. With a sneer and a point of sword rhyme, the Yin and Yang Taiji diagram ascends, and the time is flourishing, and they fight to the figure in the air.</p>
<p>There was a roar in the sky. The sound of breaking the sky is endless, and the ghostly figure flickers like a ghost. However, daoxuan real man seems to have the magic power of golden eyes. He is not bewildered by the strange magic techniques. The Taiji pattern in the air has been catching up with the ghost&rsquo;s body shadow all the time. And the closer we chase.</p>
<p>In the end, GUI Li&rsquo;s body slowed down and was caught up by the Tai Chi diagram. The cold light flashed in the eyes of immortal daoxuan, and the blue light of the Yin and Yang Taiji diagram in the sky was very bright when he ascended. It was four times larger than that just now, and he was chopped down.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi body slightly shakes, field not easy but do not know why, slowly nodded.</p>
<p>The Taiji diagram should be cut off.</p>
<p>However, the face of daoxuan immortal changed, and then with a strange roar, he even ignored the Tai Chi diagram which was gathered in the middle of the sky, and his whole body rose to the sky. The Taiji pattern was smashed into the air, and the ghostly figure disappeared. At the same time, the Taiji diagram seemed to be controlled by external forces, and it was scattered in the wind.</p>
<p>At the moment when daoxuan real man&rsquo;s body flew up, there was a huge roar from the ground in the courtyard of the villa. Within the two Zhangs round land, she trembled violently. After a moment, it was like a dragon roaring out of the world. All the stones and sand burst out of the ground in a loud noise, and even the dilapidated room collapsed at the same time. Countless pieces of wood and debris were mixed with other sand, stone and soil. All this was immediately rolled into a huge stream of massive sand and stone by a nameless force. With astonishing momentum, he chased the figure of daoxuan immortal in mid air.</p>
<p>The offensive and defensive trend, for a while, turned around strangely.</p>
<p>However, daoxuanzhen was in the middle of the sky, but he did not look frightened. Looking at the huge earth stream which was gathered and attacked by ghosts and sharp magic techniques, his whole body was suddenly shocked by the black gas, and then he rolled forward like a spirit like one. Like an invisible hand, he laid a black air wall two feet square in front of him.</p>
<p>As time went by, the powerful soil flow suddenly hit the black air wall. This time, it was like a thunder in the sky. It could be seen that there were several tiny electric lights passing by in the fierce place. The huge roar passed through the sky in an instant. The invisible but powerful wind force came down from the sky like a huge wave, centering on the black air wall in the mid air It blows away in all directions.</p>
<p>In an instant, the abandoned villa was completely destroyed. Everything was smashed by this huge force, and was blown to an unknown distance by the greater wind. Even a few lonely trees standing in the nearby wilderness were raised by the living and rooted within the scope of this thrilling fight, and their branches and leaves were completely removed, and then they flew away.</p>
<p>Tian Buyi and Lu Xueqi are very human. They have already stood up in the air and escaped the sand and soil rolling down like a torrent below. However, the wind in the air is still as strong as a knife. They still feel the pain from their deeds. It can be seen that the fight is fierce.</p>
<p>However, the situation in the field eventually turned into a mountain. The black gas wall looked weak, but it was slowly pressed down in the lightning and thunder that constantly flashed by, and the powerful Earth Dragon torrent was also suppressed one by one.</p>
<p>However, it seems that after all, it is not as powerful as daoxuan&rsquo;s hundreds of years of meditation.</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi saw the sound of wind and thunder in the field. It seemed that there was wind and thunder rolling in his eyes. After several hesitations, he gritted his teeth, and his hands glowed with red flame. With a loud drink, however, people and swords united and flew to the scene.</p>
<p>Lu Qi is stunned.</p>
<p>The red flame is burning like a flame, which envelops Tian Bu Yi&rsquo;s body in the light of the fire. It&rsquo;s as dazzling as a phoenix in a roaring fire. It just looks a little fat. However, although his posture was a little awkward, Tian Bu Yi&rsquo;s practice was not equal to his leisure time. This sword controlling trend was that Taoist immortal didn&rsquo;t dare to despise it. With a roar, his body moved away, giving way to Tian Buyi&rsquo;s sharp momentum.</p>
<p>The black air wall dissipated in an instant and covered the body of daoxuan again. In the air, the huge earth flow stopped for a moment. It seemed that it lost the support of strength. It suddenly disintegrated and fell one after another. Like a earth rain in the sky, a figure flashed through it. His face was dignified, but there was no breath. It was just fierce.</p>
<p>In the round just now, people all saw that the Taoist immortal really knew the four volumes of the book of heaven. But perhaps it was because of the short practice that he was still not a real opponent of daoxuan who had reached the state of supreme purity. However, there was not much difference between them, which was enough for a battle. This round alone, if spread out, will be enough to shake the world, so that the ghost&rsquo;s reputation.</p>
<p>The field is not easy to pierce empty with one sword. The fire of the red flame is not weak but prosperous. It is a zigzag in the air, like a rainbow passing through the sky and turning back. Zhitai daoxuan went away.</p>
<p>Daoxuan&rsquo;s body swayed and let go. At the same time, he said with a sneer: &ldquo;why, can you do it again, but you have thought of the principle, righteousness and morality? &quot;</p>
<p>The field is not easy to hum. &ldquo;You have great merits and virtues, but you are really wrong. I fought for the sake of the ancestors. Now if you die at my hand, I will give thanks to myself. &quot;</p>
<p>Guili body slightly a shock, to the field is not easy to see a look, in the heart for a moment some do not understand, but in a hurry, where will someone explain to him. But listen to the field is not easy to roar, red flame fire. Spread out the sky and earth, momentum no two, GUI Li see in the eyes, frown, a little hesitation, also flew up to attack.</p>
<p>The two great masters besieged him, and the cultivation magic power of immortal daoxuan in the past was finally revealed at this moment.</p>
<p>However, when he saw the sword formula or finger or stroke in his hand, at the same time, the dark ghost Qi was as thick as ink and black as paint, which was also changeable. It can be attacked and defended, but it is an enemy in the air. Shengsheng has blocked Tian not easy and GUI Li, and is not weak at all. In the fierce struggle, Tian Bu Yi&rsquo;s room is as powerful as a mountain. So qiangru daoxuan, a real man, had to stay away from his front for a while. He drifted back and retreated three feet. Taking advantage of this gap, Tian didn&rsquo;t seem to suddenly think of something and called out to Gui Li, &ldquo;be careful, old seven.&rdquo;. He also has the sword of killing immortals! &quot;</p>
<p>GUI Li&rsquo;s heart was filled with awe and awe at the power of the ancient sword of Zhuxian. However, a moment later, the words &ldquo;Zhuxian sword&rdquo; burned like hot oil in his heart, and his blood seemed to boil.</p>
<p>Ten years ago, Qingyun Mountain, the falling green figure!</p>
<p>In an instant, his eyes were red with blood. He roared and rushed up. All the moves were desperate. The field is not easy to be taken aback, immediately if have sense, dark sigh a, and chase up.</p>
<p>However, his business was really extraordinary. In the face of the desperate posture of GUI Li and Tian&rsquo;s fierce attack, immortal daoxuan still stubbornly pulled back the situation, although he could not get the upper hand for a moment, But there was no sign of his decline.</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi became more and more frightened. He always understood that the leader&rsquo;s elder martial brother was really a rare genius. He had practiced for ten years and was far better than himself. This time, he was willing to take great risks to stop immortal daoxuan. Most of the reason is that according to the last words passed down by his ancestors, after killing the immortal sword into the devil, he should retreat greatly. Rao is so, Tian Bu Yi Shi is also ready to die together.</p>
<p>However, after the continuous fighting, Tian Bu Yi had no choice but to admire immortal daoxuan&rsquo;s magic cultivation. He even doubted that his leader&rsquo;s practice was so high that killing the immortal sword could affect his mind but not his Taoism?</p>
<p>Seeing that the fighting methods in the field are more and more fierce, and the fierce moves are more and more crazy. However, although daoxuan&rsquo;s real man is hard to defend, he still has no leakage. On the contrary, he occasionally counterattacks, but his moves are vicious. If Tian is not easy to remedy in time, he is afraid that he will be severely damaged.</p>
<p>Seeing this dangerous scene appeared again and again, Tianya fell from the sky with auspicious atmosphere.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi finally joined the battlefield.</p>
<p>The three masters joined forces to change the situation. No matter how powerful daoxuan immortal was, he could not fight independently. Gradually, the pressure was like a mountain. All of the three opponents were masters of Taoism. The magic weapons in his hands were better than one. At this moment, immortal daoxuan was still fighting with empty hands, only relying on his own Daofa to hold three people It&rsquo;s already a shocking practice.</p>
<p>But in the hearts of the three people, a trace of doubt passed by: where is that immortal sword, which is transcendent and transcendent, has gone now? Why didn&rsquo;t immortal daoxuan take it out?</p>
<p>Just as the three of them gradually overpowered the real man daoxuan, who was struggling to support him, but was still in danger, a cold light flashed in his eyes and swept the three people in front of him.</p>
<p>GUI Li and other three people were shocked by his eyes. Before they could react, they suddenly came to daoxuan&rsquo;s hands like a raging wave. All of a sudden, the three people were startled and resisted the past by adding force on their hands. The immortal daoxuan also took advantage of this moment to flash black on his face. His left hand was holding him, and his right hand stood up in front of his chest, pointing like a knife. In his mouth, he quickly recited the strange mantra. After a moment, his five fingertips were black, flashed, flashed and scattered.</p>
<p>Sky night, miserable long world!</p>
<p>There seems to be some sound, in the dark in the sky howling, that sad meaning, soared to the sky, Yin Qi is great, the wind and cloud roll.</p>
<p>Both GUI Li and Lu Xueqi could see that immortal daoxuan was about to perform some strange and powerful magic, and even without hesitation, they would rush to attack each other. Only their bodies moved, and suddenly there was a strange voice, like something suddenly broke away. Crispy and cracked. And this voice, from their side!</p>
<p>A shivering feeling passed quietly from my heart like electricity.</p>
<p>Both stopped and turned slowly.</p>
<p>Behind them, there was a squat figure who stopped earlier.</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi&rsquo;s face still retains the look of the previous moment, but at the moment, it seems a little stiff. He is still standing in the air, and the light of red flame is generally shining, but his body is still motionless.</p>
<p>That a strange extreme, a few such as tearing heart crack lung strange sound, is from the field is not easy to send out. (to be continued. )</p>
