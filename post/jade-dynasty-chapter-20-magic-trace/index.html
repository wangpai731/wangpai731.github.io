      <p>All of a sudden, everyone&rsquo;s eyes fell on this humble Dazhufeng disciple. Tian Zhuan and Su Ru looked at each other, Su Ru smiled slightly and nodded.</p>
<p>Da Zhufeng smiled all over, and all came around. Lv Daxin repeatedly shot Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s shoulders and smiled: &ldquo;Stinky boy, I can&rsquo;t see your good luck!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan scratched his head and threw his tongue out, and his heart has changed from a surprise to a surprise. Du Bishu, who was on the side, suddenly patted his head in regret, and said, &ldquo;I already knew who should have made a bet on this lottery just now, hey, it must be a big upset, kill!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go,&rdquo; Tian Ling&rsquo;er chewed him and turned his head to Zhang Xiaofan: &ldquo;Xiaofan, anyway, you won&rsquo;t be used in the second round, it&rsquo;s better to sign this to me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan didn&rsquo;t expect the elder sister to say something like this, froze for a moment, &ldquo;Oh&rdquo;, and passed the note with &ldquo;1&rdquo; on it.</p>
<p>Song Daren&rsquo;s face changed slightly, and he looked around and whispered: &ldquo;Sister, don&rsquo;t play tricks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Ling&rsquo;er smiled, and her cheeks were reddish as if they were peachy, like jade, and her green fingers were stretched out. She gently flicked on Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s forehead and said, &ldquo;Little fool, I just kidding with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan blinked and laughed.</p>
<p>At that time, on the elder&rsquo;s side, the Cangsong Taoist frowned, and then said loudly: &ldquo;Okay, since the lottery has been completed, the disciples will wait for me to apply for the name by the number of the lottery. I know who my opponent is. Now please speak to Brother Brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were some noisy disciples who heard that the master Dao Xuanzhen was about to come out to speak, and they all became quiet. Dao Xuanzhen stood up from his seat and walked slowly to the crowd. He glanced at the disciples, and then said: &ldquo;Everyone, you are all the elites of the younger generation in my Qingyun Gate, and their talents are outstanding. In the future, the first seat, elders, and even the position of the head of the Qingyunmen, are likely to be taken by the best of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Qingyun disciples shook for a while, and many people&rsquo;s faces showed a longing and excited look.</p>
<p>Daoxuan Zhenren showed a kind smile, saying: &ldquo;Of course, to achieve this step, you need to redouble your efforts to sit in the position of the first elders behind me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everyone said in unison: &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dao Xuanzhen&rsquo;s hands covered his long beard and nodded his head. He said: &ldquo;I have a reputation in Qingyun. Since the establishment of the Qingyunzi Patriarch, it has always been a famous way. Nowadays, it is the righteous leader on the world&rsquo;s cultivation path. Fang today, The right way is prosperous, the demon retreats, and the world enjoys peace. However, the evil way is evil, evil and vicious, and its heart is not dead. Over the years, it seems that there is a tendency to move around. At this time, it is even more necessary for me to wait for the right way. Cultivate the Tao and be determined. As long as we are strong and self-reliant, the evil demon will be able to take advantage of the outside path!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The disciples shouted: &ldquo;Care to follow the teachings of the master!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Daoxuan Zhenren smiled and said, &ldquo;Okay, okay. There is one more thing, I will announce to everyone: In order to encourage the disciples of Qingyunmen to work hard for the Tao and inspire their spiritual practice, I have discussed with the first elders and decided to start from here. The second Qimai Huiwu began, and each time after the Qimai Huiwu trial, the final winner was given a small reward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!!!&rdquo; There was a commotion among Qingyun&rsquo;s disciples.</p>
<p>Real Dao Xuan looked at these young disciples and smiled, &ldquo;This time the prize is the&rsquo;six mirrors&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Zhang Xiaofan stayed for a moment, never heard of this thing, could not help but looked around, but saw Tian Ling&rsquo;er, Du Bishu and other people also have a blank face, and the young disciples around the other lines seemed to be too It is not clear, but disciples such as Qi Hao, Song Daren, Wen Min, etc., who took a long time to get started, changed their complexions, and their faces showed a rare excitement and longing.</p>
<p>Tian Ling&rsquo;er and others also noticed what Master and others seemed to know, and quietly asked in the past: &ldquo;Master, what is the Liuhe mirror?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren whispered: &ldquo;The six-folded mirror is a magic weapon passed down by the tenth generation of the ancestors of this door, and I have never seen the specific appearance, but I have heard Master say that this is one of the rare treasures of this door. The power is great, and there is something more amazing. As long as the applicator has strong spiritual power, the six-fold mirror can reflect all attacks and become invincible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everyone opened their mouths, and Du Bishu stuttered a little: &ldquo;Well, isn&rsquo;t that invincible?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren shrugged his shoulders and said: &ldquo;Anyway, I don&rsquo;t know exactly what it looks like, but Master will never be wrong. This time,&rdquo; he glanced at Daoxuan Zhenren, lowering his voice and saying, &ldquo;Look This time, it seems that the head and the master have made a big blood!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s face is a little weird. Most people seem to swallow secretly. It seems that Qizhen is at the forefront, and even those who practice monasticism will inevitably move their hearts.</p>
<p>Dao Xuanzhen stopped for a while, smiled and watched the young disciples talking, and said after a while: &ldquo;Okay, that&rsquo;s basically how it is. You go back and take a rest. Early tomorrow, Qimai Huiwu will start the test.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Qingyun disciples saluted in unison and said in unison: &ldquo;Yes, they are real people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Daoxuan Zhenren nodded and said, &ldquo;You go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the disciples gradually retreated, leaving only the first seat of the seven veins of Qingyunmen with more than a dozen elders in the hall. Dao Xuanzhen turned back and smiled at the elders: &ldquo;Brothers, you also go back to rest earlier Well, starting tomorrow, you need to worry a lot about the competition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some of the elders had white hair and wrinkles, but some looked younger and tighter. They listened to Daoxuan Zhenren&rsquo;s words at the moment. They didn&rsquo;t say much one by one and went out one by one until the end. In the Yuqing Hall, only the first of the seven veins of the Qingyun Gate was left.</p>
<p>Realistic Dao Xuan slowly put away the kind smile he had hung on his face, glanced at the other six people sitting on the chair, and said lightly, &ldquo;Well, now there are only seven of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shang Zhengliang, the first seat of &ldquo;Chaoyang Peak&rdquo; sitting on the right, frowned and said, &ldquo;Brother Master, do you have anything to say to us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Daoxuan Zhenren nodded, expressionless, and slowly said, &ldquo;I just went to see Lingzun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as this remark came out, everyone changed their faces.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Walking down the stairs, the disciples were still trembling when they passed the edge of the Bishuitan, but this time the water unicorn was sleeping peacefully, and there was no more movement.</p>
<p>After crossing the Hongqiao and returning to the huge square like a fairyland in the &ldquo;Sea of ​​Clouds&rdquo;, Lin Jingyu and Zhang Xiaofan said a few words, and then went with the disciples of Longshoufeng. Zhang Xiaofan watched him go away, and then walked back to the Dazhufeng crowd. After listening to Song Daren telling everyone about the matters needing attention and staying at the meeting, Zhang Xiaofan listened and suddenly remembered something and shouted: &ldquo;Oops, bad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everyone was shocked, Tian Ling&rsquo;er stood beside him, surprised: &ldquo;Xiaofan, what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan looked around and anxiously said: &ldquo;I just talked to Jing Yu just now, but I forgot Xiao Hui, and now I don&rsquo;t know where it went?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everyone remembered this, and really didn&rsquo;t notice the trace of the gray-haired monkey. At this time, they all looked around, and they saw that Bai Yun was insignificant. The disciples of each vein gradually dispersed, but there was no shadow of the little gray monkey.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was very anxious in his heart. Since he brought Xiaohui back from the valley two years ago, he lived in a house with one monkey (and later added big dog rhubarb) in the past two years. Cloud, the place up and down is incredibly large, how can I find it if little ash goes to find wild fruit to eat?</p>
<p>In a hurry, Zhang Xiaofan suddenly heard Tian Linger on the other side yell, turned his head to look, and saw Tian Linger showing a smile, pointing in front of his finger, laughing: &ldquo;Look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everyone looked at it, and couldn&rsquo;t help but laughed dumbly. I saw Xiao Hui sitting steadily on the back of Tian Huang&rsquo;s hard-to-breed dog. He squeaked in his mouth and waved his monkey paw to Zhang Xiaofan. The mouth of the big yellow dog running here closed tightly, biting a fleshy bone somehow.</p>
<p>After a while, Da Huang ran to Xiaohui with his little ash, and Xiaohui jumped on Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s shoulder twice, Zhang Xiaofan quickly touched its monkey head, pretending to be angry and said, &ldquo;Where did you go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Hui was not afraid. He smiled and pointed at the rhubarb that was lying on the ground nibbling the bones. The middle of the &ldquo;squeak&rdquo; sound was more than drawing pictures. Zhang Xiaofan looked at it for a while, and suddenly said: &ldquo;Where did this bone come from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Hui heard that there was another comparison, while pointing in one direction at the end of the square. Zhang Xiaofan looked at Song Daren. He saw Song Daren quickly looked around. His face was rather embarrassing and funny. He lowered his voice and quietly said: There is the kitchen where Nagato disciples eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everyone stayed for a while, then they all laughed and shook their heads one after another. Song Daren took the lead and walked to the other side, saying: &ldquo;Let’s go to the rest house too, by the way, little sister, you are a woman, arranged you and Xiaozhufeng Sister and sister live together, are you okay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Ling&rsquo;er shook his head and smiled: &ldquo;I wanted to talk more with Sister Wen Min, and at the same time, I would like to help you, Master, say a few good things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everyone laughed, Song Daren&rsquo;s face was red, pretending not to hear, strode out, everyone behind was laughing, and Zhang Xiaofan, who was walking at the end, did not join in, but stared at the gray monkey on his shoulder and said: &ldquo;Dead Monkey, you will run as a thief again and see how I cure you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Hui squeaked twice and grinned. He didn&rsquo;t know if he couldn&rsquo;t understand it, or he didn&rsquo;t even care about Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s words.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan scolded it again, walked forward, walked a few steps, and remembered something, turned his head and said loudly: &ldquo;Go away, dead dog, you know to eat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rhubarb lying on the ground nibbling on the bones finally lifted his eyes and watched that everyone had gone further, and then stood up, grabbed half of the meat bones and chased lazily.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>In the Yuqing Hall, the first seat of the seven veins of the Qingyun Gate will gather here. At this time, their attention has been attracted by Daoxuan Zhenren.</p>
<p>The first Tianyun Taoist in Luoxia Peak stood up first and said, &ldquo;Brother Master, then you can see what happened to Lingzun just now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Realistic Dao Xuan sighed and said slowly: &ldquo;I have looked carefully, and Lingzun is no different.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Surprise appeared on everyone&rsquo;s first face.</p>
<p>Dao Xuan Zhenren looked at these fellow brothers and said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s true. I have watched it several times. The spirit is as usual. I can&rsquo;t figure out why it suddenly has such a great rage, but it disappears so fast! &quot;</p>
<p>Tian was not able to ponder for a while, and said: &ldquo;I think the target of Lingzun&rsquo;s attack seems to be a group of young disciples. Could it be that someone is angry with it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Xiaoyuefeng, the first Master of Water Moon, said: &ldquo;Impossible, if the disciples were really angry with Spirit Venerable, how could Spirit Venerate give up under one blow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shuiyue looks pretty, but when she speaks, the tone is cold, as if with a hint of coldness, Tian is not easy to glance at her, and she keeps her mouth shut.</p>
<p>Dao Xuan Zhenren shook his head and said: &ldquo;Ling Zun is an ancient spirit beast, the sex has been psychic, and there has never been such a sudden abnormality for thousands of years. There must be a reason.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sitting in the first seat of &ldquo;Feng Huifeng&rdquo; on the left, the two temples are frost-white, and the oldest uncle Zeng Chang said among the seven people in the seat: &ldquo;Is there any conclusion in the mind of Brother Zhang?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Daoxuan Zhenren sighed and said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t hide from you, I can&rsquo;t figure it out. But the spirit venerable is my spirit beast in Qingyunmen Town. It&rsquo;s not a small thing. I wanted to use the secret psychic&rsquo;psychic&rsquo; Check it out, but&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Speaking of which, Daoxuan Zhenren suddenly stopped, and the people next to him listened halfway, and suddenly he didn&rsquo;t say anything. Tian Yi first asked, &ldquo;Brother Master, what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Realistic Dao Xuanzhen face embarrassed, said: &ldquo;This psychic technique is a little trick, but it can communicate with Lingzun a little bit, but when I was about to use it, Lingzun actually fell asleep, I It can’t be done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everyone was dumbfounded.</p>
<p>Daoxuan Zhenren coughed two times and said rightly: &ldquo;There is no need to worry about this matter. After Ling Zun wakes up, we will discuss the matter for a long time. And there is one more thing right now, I would like to discuss it with fellow brothers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everyone saw that Dao Xuanzhen&rsquo;s face was serious, and it seemed that it was not a trivial matter.</p>
<p>Real Dao Xuan also sat back in his seat and pondered for a while before saying: &ldquo;You, do you know that there is a &ldquo;Kangsang Mountain&rdquo; three thousand miles away in the East?&rdquo; (Note 1)</p>
<p>Everyone was stunned, and the Cangsong Taoist first came back to God and said, &ldquo;Is it the elder brother-in-chief that is the empty mulberry mountain with the&rsquo;Mantou Cave?'&rdquo;</p>
<p>Daoxuan Zhenren nodded and said, &ldquo;It is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle Zeng often frowned: &ldquo;I heard that the&rsquo;Mantou Cave&rsquo; is a natural giant hole, straight into the ground, unfathomable. Among them, it is cold and wet. Only countless bats were born in it. It is said that there are millions of them. . How can Brother Brothers bring up this kind of rough land?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dao Xuanzhen slowly said: &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know, although this ancient cave of Manta looks not close to humans and animals, but it was an important stronghold of the Demon Religion eight hundred years ago. The ancient cave is cold and wet, just suitable for Those evil demons practiced demon dharma. Later, under the encirclement and suppression of my righteous people, the demonic rebellion went away, and here it was abandoned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue spoke coldly, and said, &ldquo;What is the meaning of the brother-in-law again at this moment?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shuiyue speaks to Daoxuan like this, and his attitude can be said to be quite unfriendly, but everyone here knows that Master Shuiyue has always spoken to people, and Daoxuanzhen people do not care about it, only sighed, &ldquo;Water Sister Yueshi didn’t know, just half a year ago, I got a biography of Incense Valley, saying that it was near Nawanbat Grottoes recently, and there seemed to be signs of the activities of Demon Remnants, and so I sought my opinion. Then, the second student Yi was hurried to Kongsang Mountain to check.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upon listening to Shangzheng Liang of Chaoyang Peak, he said with a smile: &ldquo;This is not good. Master Xiao Yicai is a talented nephew and has a profound practice. He is really a leader in the Qingyun Gate. Coming back home. With him gone, what else can&rsquo;t be done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dao Xuan Zhenren smiled slightly and said, &ldquo;Brother Shang has been praised, but Yi Cai went to Kongsang Mountain. A few months later, he came back with a book and said that there was indeed a demon who was in the vicinity of Wanbat Ancient Cave. Their purpose is even more amazing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everyone was taken aback, Uncle Zeng often said: &ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Daoxuan Zhenren&rsquo;s face was quiet, and he could not see any emotions or sorrows. He said: &ldquo;According to Yicai Xinxin, he captured a demon cultist and forced out from his mouth, it turned out that Wanbat Ancient Cave was a demon 800 years ago. The main hall of the &ldquo;Blood Refining Hall&rdquo;, a tribe of the teaching, was located at that time. The blood refining hall was strong and one of the five forces of the Demon Church. However, after being defeated by my righteous ancestors, it collapsed and the Wanbat Ancient Cave was abandoned. But somehow, in recent years, the blood refining hall that has been declining for a long time seems to have signs of looking up, and it is said that in the blood refining hall, there was a battle in the Wanbat Ancient Cave, although all the main characters of the blood refining hall were condemned to my righteous people. Under the sword, but in the Wanbat Ancient Cave, there is a hidden treasure cave with many treasures and strange treasures.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, everyone has come to understand it. Cangsong Taoist sneered and said, &ldquo;The demon is skewed and delusional!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Realistic Dao Xuan shook his head and said, &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter whether this rumor is true or not, but as far as I know, after the war 800 years ago, the righteous people did not find any secret caves in the Manta Cave. Others It’s okay, but if there’s really this hidden treasure hole, I’m afraid that there will be a big evil in it, but we have to guard it.”</p>
<p>Everyone looked at Daoxuan, and Tianyun said: &ldquo;Brother, what the heinous thing are you referring to, so important?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Realistic Dao Xuan glanced at everyone around him and said in a deep voice, &ldquo;Blood Beads!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The crowd shook their faces, and the Cangsong Taoist was surprised: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t this murderous thing disappear as long as the old black heart dies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Realistic Dao Xuan shook his head and said, &ldquo;Otherwise, the old Blackheart died, but the blood-sucking beads may not be in the world. It seems that such a fierce thing can not be mastered by the rest of the world. If the demon demon has not enough practice, it can be collected. It is not known. And the old man of the Black Heart was born in the blood refining hall of the Demon Church, so I speculate that it is likely that the blood bead will be in this dense hole.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After listening to the words of Dao Xuan Zhenren, everyone was silent for a while, but for a long time, it was the cold Master Shuiyue who said: &ldquo;What is the intention of Brother Zhang?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Daoxuan Zhenren said: &ldquo;I received the Biography of Yi Cai and immediately informed the Incense Valley and Tianyin Temple. Soon the two major schools also spoke back, saying that they would also send proud disciples to the Kongsang Mountain to stop the devil. Teach the wicked and traitor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian is not easy to frown: &ldquo;The brother in charge means&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Daoxuan Zhenren smiled on his face and said, &ldquo;This is also a rare opportunity for great experience.
