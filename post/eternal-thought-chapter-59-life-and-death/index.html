      <p>Almost at the moment when Chen Heng&rsquo;s voice came out, Bai Xiaochun, who was nailed to the tree, suddenly raised his head. His eyes showed fierceness. His left hand lifted up, and he grabbed the tail of the arrow outside his right shoulder. Regardless of the barb in his body, he pulled it out.</p>
<p>When a large amount of blood was sprayed out, the arrow was pulled out by him with several pieces of flesh and blood. Bai xiaochuntong&rsquo;s body trembled strongly, but there was no hesitation. Ziqi Yuding skill broke out completely at this moment, condensed into a light weight, and threw it away directly towards the coming Luochen family member with eight layers of condensation.</p>
<p>At this moment, the sharp sound of breaking the air suddenly spread out. When it reverberated in all directions, the arrow roared at a faster speed and went straight to the Luochen people with eight layers of condensation.</p>
<p>The strength of this arrow is as strong as a mountain.</p>
<p>At the same time, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s body fell down and pinched a finger with both hands, and immediately the wooden sword roared out to form a double kill. Suddenly, the sense of killing shocked the sky. During this period of fighting with the Luochen people, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s fighting experience rapidly ascended at a speed that he did not realize, as if he had this talent for fighting in his bones Not revealed, now by the continuous stimulation of life and death, completely burst out.</p>
<p>The Luo Chen family member who was about to shoot the second arrow with his bow changed greatly. He didn&rsquo;t expect Bai Xiaochun to be so cruel here. He even recalled that he had just chosen to hit the arrow and avoided the entanglement of flesh and blood, and now he is fighting back rapidly. Maybe this purpose already exists.</p>
<p>His body suddenly retreated. As a full-fledged clansman with eight layers of condensate, he has rich experience in fighting fierce beasts in the Luoxing mountain range all the year round. Although he has lost his initiative and is in crisis, he did not immediately apply protection when he retreated. Instead, he used the precious time that was fleeting away Pull the half opened bow, fully open it!</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t stop it!&rdquo; When he roared, the second arrow roared out and went straight to Bai Xiaochun, showing ferocity in his eyes.</p>
<p>In his opinion, Bai Xiaochun will definitely use a wooden sword to stop him. In this way, he will not be faced with a double kill, but can resolve the crisis and change from passive to active.</p>
<p>But at this time, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s eyes were red, and he could not give the other party the slightest chance. Once he was entangled, other people would soon be near. At that time, he would surely die.</p>
<p>As soon as he gritted his teeth, he did not control the wooden sword to block the slightest bit. He allowed the arrow to approach and penetrate through his abdomen. At the same time, his arrow burst into the chest of the Luochen people. When he took the blood, the people with eight layers of blood let out a shrill scream. His eyes were shocked and his body was about to retreat.</p>
<p>But at this time, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s wooden sword, like a life-threatening one, came in a twinkling of an eye, and his head fell off.</p>
<p>After doing this, Bai Xiaochun spurts out a mouthful of blood, without a moment&rsquo;s pause, she turns straight to the jungle behind her and quickly disappears in the jungle.</p>
<p>That is to say, during a dozen breaths, the figures of the Luochen family, who are running straight to this place from all around, come one by one, and they are frightened one by one. They just saw the scene with their own eyes. They were shocked by Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s cruelty and the exchange of injury for killing.</p>
<p>Chen Heng, the young master of the fallen Chen, also shook his body and appeared on the edge of the jungle.</p>
<p>He looked at the man who had lost his head and the man whose eyes had turned into flesh and blood. He was silent, and his eyes showed a more powerful killing opportunity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chen Feng, Chen Gu, you two go to search for other areas to prevent being lured away from the mountain by this man. Others Follow me in and never come back without taking out the head of this man! &quot; As soon as Chen Heng&rsquo;s sleeve swung, he first stepped into the jungle. Behind him, there were five members of the Luochen family, three of whom had eight layers of condensate, and two had seven layers of condensate.</p>
<p>The two seven layers of condensate retrogressed and followed Chen Heng&rsquo;s orders and went out to search, while the three eight layers of condensate condensed their killing intention one by one and rushed into the jungle with Chen Heng.</p>
<p>In the jungles of the nameless mountains, Bai Xiaochun was dizzy. All his shoulders, abdomen and right leg were seriously injured. The cold invaded in the rainy night, which made his body tremble even more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going to die&hellip;&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun laughs bitterly. He looks at the numerous injuries on his body. The piercing pain makes his tears in his eyes.</p>
<p>Before his parents died of illness, his mind was filled with fear of watching their gradually cold bodies.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was from then on that he began to be particularly afraid of death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to live!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun raised his left hand to wipe away the tears from the corner of his eyes. He bit his cold teeth and ran fast in the jungle. He didn&rsquo;t know where to go or what would happen in the future. There was only one strong thought in his mind at the moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Live!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fear of death, at this moment, also inspired the infinite power, supporting Bai Xiaochun, in this thunderstorm night, rapid forward.</p>
<p>Even he slowly found that his cultivation had become loose after these battles of life and death. It seemed that he was not far away from breaking through the sixth layer of condensate.</p>
<p>Gradually, the early sun appeared in the distant sky. A bunch of sunlight penetrated through the leaves and fell on the rain drops in the forest, reflecting a wonderful light, but the rain never stopped.</p>
<p>After Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s death, the four Chen Heng people in the jungle are also running rapidly. Chen Heng&rsquo;s face is more and more ugly. The speed of the other party is too fast. Even if he is seriously injured, he and others can&rsquo;t catch up with him in the jungle. Even after chasing for a night, he can&rsquo;t find out the direction of the other party.</p>
<p>In particular, the thunderstorm washed away all traces. Even though they were Xiuzhen families living in the Luoxing mountains, they had been dealing with fierce animals in the jungle all the year round, and they could not see any trace in this rainy day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Scattered search, this person is seriously injured, can not escape too far, you three hundred Zhang apart, once found this person, do not fight, immediately back, send me a message!&rdquo; Chen Heng clenched his teeth and opened his mouth word by word. The three people with eight layers of condensate gas behind him hesitated for a moment, nodded in succession and scattered.</p>
<p>Time goes by, a day later, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s exhaustion has reached a critical point. If it was not for the strong will to survive, he would have fallen.</p>
<p>His lips were dry and haggard, and even his speed slowed down. After walking for a stick of incense, suddenly, his face changed. When he suddenly looked to the right, he saw a figure leaping from there, not rushing to himself, but escaping backward.</p>
<p>This is a young man with a long face. He is one of the three family members of the Luochen family. When he retreats, he holds a jade slip in his right hand. He pinches it hard and sends the message immediately.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s heart sank, his body suddenly accelerated and galloped toward the depth of the jungle.</p>
<p>The long faced young man&rsquo;s face changed. For Bai Xiaochun, he was already worried. When he was hesitating whether to pursue him, he immediately showed a happy look in his eyes. At the moment, two figures were coming rapidly.</p>
<p>In the distance, there are two layers of Changhong.</p>
<p>The three of them are approaching here, whistling and approaching. According to their speed, the two clansmen with eight layers of gas condensate can approach with ten breath, and Chen Heng, with 20 at most, will also appear.</p>
<p>The young man with a long face laughed and made a decision. His whole body cultivation broke out in a roar, and a large amount of protection light appeared. As soon as he patted the storage bag with his right hand, a big sword appeared in his hand.</p>
<p>The sword is seven feet long. It looks very simple. It was held by a young man with a long face. When he wielded it, it was cut into four directions. It was extremely sharp. He saw the opportunity to kill him, and with a fierce smile, he spread out full speed and went straight to Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Tianjiao of Lingxi sect must be very pleasant to kill. It should have a more sense of accomplishment than killing those casual practitioners!&rdquo; The laughter of the young man with a long face spread out. The sword in his hand was cut hard. Suddenly, a sword light cut across the four sides, forming the wind of breaking the air. When he pinched the formula with his left hand, he pointed forward, and immediately a fist sized fireball appeared and flew to Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>With a bang, despite the thunderstorm, the fireball was still exploding. When the fireball exploded, it radiated heat, which caused an impact all around. Bai Xiaochun was stunned. When he turned his head, he saw a murderous opportunity in his eyes. He knew that if he did not solve the other party, he could not continue to escape.</p>
<p>But at the moment when Bai Xiaochun turned around, the long faced young man suddenly stepped back and showed sarcasm in his eyes. He would never give Bai Xiaochun a chance or get close to him. He had only one purpose, involving Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun clenched his fist, shook his body and galloped again. But soon, the long faced young man interfered. After a few breaths, two other people with eight levels of condensation gas were also near. When they saw Bai Xiaochun, their whole body cultivation broke out and they went straight to Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>At the same time, the young man with a long face laughed, no longer avoiding, but all the speed spread out, together with the other two people, from three different directions, to kill Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>The three of them have eight layers of condensing gas. Now, Chen Heng, who flies from afar, is relieved. He knows that even if the other party has any means, he will surely die.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unfortunately, you don&rsquo;t have the chance to grow up.&rdquo; Chen Heng spoke faintly, but in the blink of an eye, his face suddenly changed.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun was seen in the distance. The three figures around him roared close. When they started their magic arts, Bai Xiaochun pinched the formula with his right hand and roared out of the wooden sword. He ran straight to one of them. At the same time, he clenched his right hand and blew away at the other.</p>
<p>The sound reverberated, and the wooden sword was blocked. His fist fell, which made the corner of the mouth of a people with eight layers of condensation overflowed with blood. Although his body retreated, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s blood gushed out and his wound split. But before he retreated, the long faced youth suddenly approached, and the sword in his hand was sharp and stabbed.</p>
<p>At the critical moment, Bai Xiaochun narrowly avoids the position of his heart. The sword penetrates through his chest in an instant. The pain makes Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s sweat uncontrollable. When he shivers, the long faced young man laughs and is about to take back the sword. Suddenly, Bai Xiaochun grabs the sword in his chest, and his body suddenly rushes forward, allowing the sword to rub through his body No hilt.</p>
<p>At the cost of this, his whole person appeared directly in front of the long faced youth. After the long faced youth was stunned, his scalp would explode and be shrouded in a strong crisis of life and death. When he suddenly released his hand and wanted to retreat, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s right hand, flashing black, grabbed the long faced youth&rsquo;s neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&hellip;&rdquo; The long faced youth opened his eyes, but his words did not wait to finish</p>
