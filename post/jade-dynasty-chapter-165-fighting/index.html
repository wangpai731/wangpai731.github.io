      <p>A strong smell of blood enveloped the Tongtian peak of Qingyun Mountain. Even the lazy water unicorn, the spirit beast of Zhenshan, seemed anxious at the moment, swimming back and forth in the cold water pool, making a low roar. But standing in the Yuqing hall, the noble people of the right path, one by one, looked at the foot of the mountain. After Hongqiao is the huge Yunhai square. At this moment, a fierce and cruel battle has been going on there for a day and a night.</p>
<p>Although we have expected the horror and tragedy of this battle of monsters, the cruelty of the scene still makes many people in the right path feel cold. The demons attacked from the foot of the mountain, and the whole way was like a storm. Although the people in the right path kept attacking, the huge torrent formed by countless demons did not care about the few enemies who sneaked on the side, such as thunder and raging tide, swept up, and those in the moment were swept away. And the people who attack and block around are helpless. In the face of the dark, killing one or two or even dozens of animal demons is almost nothing!</p>
<p>In this way, the attack of the slow beast demon, which was originally arranged by the orthodox way, was destroyed by these seemingly cruel and ignorant beasts in an instant. The people in the right path were forced to retreat to Tongtian peak until the monsters attacked the Yunhai square. Daoxuan Zhenren and others took the opportunity to gather most of the forces of the right path and confront the enemy in the front of the huge cloud sea square. For a time, in the light of magic weapons flying all over the sky, the blood and flesh flew across the cloud sea of Tongtian peak, and howled and howled.</p>
<p>In front of them, half of them were standing on the ground, half were flying in the air, and countless colorful lights were standing in front of the crowd. The colorful and cold walls were standing in front of them.</p>
<p>As if the demon did not know the pain and fear at all, like the spring tide, it bumped into the light wall nearly several miles wide with flesh and blood. In a moment, the cold light trembled and the awns flashed disorderly, and the frightening voice swept across the peak in a flash like dense rain. Straight into the heart.</p>
<p>The first hundreds of monsters were instantly twisted into broken flesh and blood by the cold millisecond light. The thick bloody blood swept over my ears like a gust of wind, and the blood rain exploded all over the sky, and then slowly fell down, bit by bit. It fell on the face and hands of those in the right way.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sick of hearing it!</p>
<p>Not waiting for people to calm down, the follow-up demons have come again, the original flat light wall suddenly like a huge pressure, many were pressed in, showing an irregular curved shape.</p>
<p>There are even a few places. The disciples who are weak in skill and weak in mind are weak in their hands. One of the magic weapons in their hands is not well mastered. In the roar and roar, monsters pounce on them, and several people fall to the ground. No one can see them again in the cry.</p>
<p>Outside the Yuqing hall, daoxuan immortal, master Puhong and Yun Yilan are dignified. Daoxuan real man looked at them and nodded at the same time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything is up to the elder martial brother,&rdquo; said Yun Yi Lan</p>
<p>Daoxuan turned back without expression. Looking down at the foot of the mountain for a while, I saw that above the sea of clouds, the light wall was crushed by a huge black tide, and several weak places were crumbling. It seemed that they could not support it. From time to time, there were tragic voices, and the smell of blood in the air was more and more intense.</p>
<p>He frowned, and suddenly looked up, only to see the sky high, dark clouds. As the wind and cloud sped along, it seemed that the mysterious figure could still be seen. Immortal daoxuan watched deeply. After a moment, he turned his head, and Xiao Yi, who had been following him, took a step. Daoxuan immortal light way: &ldquo;you go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai answered, quickly turned around and waved his right hand. He was the first to fly. Behind him were nearly a hundred people in the right way. Although the number was not as large as that on the Yunhai square. However, the magic weapon&rsquo;s brilliance is far from that of the disciples below. At a glance, they are all elite disciples and some scattered immortals in the meridians of the right path. Under the leadership of Xiao Yicai, these people flew down to the sea of clouds, where the battle situation is tight.</p>
<p>Thundering thunder, lightning in the sky, as if returning to the rain many years ago. But somehow, even on this rainy day, there is such a strange moon in the sky, very bright and white.</p>
<p>The feeling of rain on the face, so cool</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan looked back, wind and rain Xiaoxiao, that small village, finally quietly disappeared. He reached out his hand involuntarily, trying to grasp something, but it was empty. Only behind him, Puzhi&rsquo;s eyes looked at his figure quietly.</p>
<p>The next moment, he has been in that familiar room, the unique smell of bamboo peak, in the surrounding, so kind and familiar.</p>
<p>In the distance, there were the voices of the elder martial brothers, the frolic of rhubarb and Xiaohui, and the familiar footsteps. A young girl rushed into the room with a smile like a flower, and said with a smile, &ldquo;big sloth, get up quickly, go up the mountain to do your homework and cut bamboo&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>His whole body trembled, and all of a sudden, the heart dike that had been built in his heart for decades broke and collapsed.</p>
<p>He was in tears!</p>
<p>The withered palm stretched out from behind and patted him gently on the shoulder. The kind voice asked in a low voice, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter, child, why cry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan Huoran turned back, looking at the compassionate face, the body can not help but tense. He was staring at the eyes in front of him. He wanted to see the deep heart of the compassionate old monk. However, Pu Zhi&rsquo;s eyes were always so peaceful but deep. No matter how hard he tried, he could not see through.</p>
<p>Word for word, as if in a low voice, he asked, &ldquo;why, why, why do you want to choose me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Puzhi didn&rsquo;t answer. He just looked at Zhang Xiaofan with compassion and peace in his eyes. He couldn&rsquo;t see any emotion fluctuation, let alone regret!</p>
<p>Everything around me disappeared again, and the world was just two of them. Zhang Xiaofan, no, now he looks like a demon. His fierce blood red eyes once again occupy his eyes, revealing a killing intention from head to foot. With a light sound of &ldquo;puff&rdquo;, his front clothes split, and the soul eating magic wand flickering with dim red light rises across his chest.</p>
<p>Puzhi&rsquo;s eyes finally shook for a moment, and slowly looked at the evil thing. At the top of the soul devouring, the shining &ldquo;blood sucking bead&rdquo;, a little bit of dark red blood all over the body of the bead, seems to be staring at him, with a cold sneer.</p>
<p>The bloody breath of Pei&rsquo;s inevitability suddenly appeared from the ghost in front of him, and then rushed over like a mountain and a sea. It was like a strong wind blowing through, and the Puzhi monk&rsquo;s robe was dancing for hunting. Staring at it, the ferocious red awn with despair rushed like a trapped animal.</p>
<p>He stood there with no intention of evading. Motionless, at the next moment, the desperate and ferocious red awn passed through his body and slowly stopped behind him, forming a ghostly figure.</p>
<p>The old monk slowly bowed his head. He took a slow look at his body. Then, with a sigh, his head fell down and his body slowly fell to one side.</p>
<p>Behind him, the ghost turned around and looked at Puzhi. His face changed rapidly and gradually. The fierce color quietly faded, and the pain again spread. The red light in his eyes was dim. He looked at the body which seemed to be losing his life. In an instant, he gave out a heartrending roar!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The black wand fell to the ground, and he seemed to lose all his strength in an instant. Thunder bursts in the sky, lightning and thunder, wind and rain Xiaoxiao, a chill fell in the heart.</p>
<p>He stumbled to Puzhi. The ground under his feet seemed to be very muddy. Every step exhausted his physical strength. He kept falling down and got up again. He used all his strength to climb to the thin body. Finally, he struggled to Puzhi&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>One, he tightly grasped the withered palm. For more than ten years, the most cordial palm was in his hand, and his eyes were misty with tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master Master&hellip; &quot; He choked. Low cry, tears, as if with a bit of hysteria: &ldquo;why, why, this is why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Puzhi turned his head and looked at the young man who seemed to be helpless again. He didn&rsquo;t answer, but his face was so pale. His lips moved gently, but he didn&rsquo;t say anything.</p>
<p>Withered palm, slowly raised, stretched out to the face of the young man in front of him. The hand was constantly shaking in the wind and rain, and the wind knife and rain arrow seemed to fall between his hands. Zhang Xiaofan stopped crying and looked up at him.</p>
<p>Two people&rsquo;s eyes in the wind and rain saw, looked at each other, solidified, static, strange, estranged</p>
<p>Puzhi&rsquo;s lips moved as if he wanted to say something, but there was no, and then his hand dropped gently without a sound.</p>
<p>Life, as if leaving in an instant!</p>
<p>The teenager was stunned. His whole body was stiff. He slowly lowered his head and looked at his hands: &ldquo;I killed him, I killed him&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>As if it was the strange atmosphere around him, strange changes began to take place in him. For a while, he showed a ferocious and ferocious look on his face. At the same time, he appeared to be miserable. It seemed that he had become Zhang Xiaofan, the once simple disciple of Qingyun. Beside Puzhi&rsquo;s body, he struggled in pain.</p>
<p>In the sky, under the sky, still wind and rain Xiaoxiao, desolate!</p>
<p>As soon as Xiao Yicai and other elite disciples joined the battle group, they immediately stabilized the situation.</p>
<p>Moreover, this part of the disciples had a tacit understanding for a long time. They flew straight to the most difficult battlefield in groups. Those gaps that had been attacked by demons suddenly got the strong support of these fresh troops, and suddenly rebounded back, killing all the monsters in a flash, and the whole light screen turned to be more solid, bright and indestructible.</p>
<p>Among the crowd, the most dazzling place is in the center of the light curtain. Lu Xueqi holds the Tianya magic sword, standing in the clouds like a nine heavenly fairy. In the boundless sunlight, Tianya turns into a bloody sword. Where she passes by, it is a hill piled up under her feet.</p>
<p>After a little while, the evil monsters were also worried about the cold woman in white, who was pink. The people in the right path behind Lu Xueqi were also shocked. In this battle field of life and death, Lu Xueqi looked at life and death as nothing, galloped, and often killed among the animal demons between the gaps, setting off a series of bloody storms.</p>
<p>However, on her face, there was no expression, no fear of pain, no fear of disgust, and even the bloody stench of animal blood splashed on her always love Jie, Lu Xueqi did not have any reaction. She is just fighting like this, exhausted all her strength, in the bloody wind, her cool and beautiful face seems to be particularly moving, which makes people feel shocked, but dare not have the slightest approach.</p>
<p>An hour passed quietly, the black torrent always oppressed the light curtain, but it did not break through. Once like a fairyland, the square of cloud sea is full of lifeless bodies and bloodstains. In the dark sky, dark clouds linger low and stare at all these things coldly.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a strange sound, like a trumpet or a howl, suddenly rang out in the depths of the animal demons. It sounded sad and sad, like a wolf howling to the moon on a full moon night. With the sound, the torrent of monsters, which had been one after another and fearless of death, suddenly stopped, stopped the offensive, and then slowly retreated, widening the distance between the right path and the other.</p>
<p>And here on the right path, with the temporary stop of the battle, the light curtain darkens one after another, followed by the sound of countless people&rsquo;s hard breathing that fills the sea of clouds.</p>
<p>Everyone seemed to be bloody. The desolate and strange color of blood covered the whole sea of clouds. In the open space of the sea of clouds, there were corpses everywhere, including those of animal spirits and human disciples.</p>
<p>Most of the righteous disciples flying in the air fell down and took time to breathe. No one knows when those crazy beasts will attack again. Only a few of them are still watching the sky.</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai frowned tightly and took back his eyes from afar. The monsters were everywhere, and there was no end in sight. Up to now, there is no bright future for this decisive battle of life and death. He sighed softly in his heart, turned his head, and suddenly was stunned. He saw that Lu Xueqi was standing quietly in the air not far away from him. The fishy wind blew, and his clothes, dyed red with blood, swayed gently.</p>
<p>On that unique face, there is no trace of vitality at the moment, just staring at the front, that piece of black torrent.</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai frowned and intuitively found that Lu Xueqi was not in a good mood. Just as he was about to ask, suddenly, there was a roar again from the animal demons in front of him. After a while, his galloping steps like thunder and the endless black torrent of mountains and seas rushed over again. And this time, in addition to those vicious monsters, there are a number of extremely large monsters, which rush towards the right path with open teeth and claws.</p>
<p>In a moment, all the people of the right path stood up one after another, and the brilliant magic weapons of the light flew into the sky, forming the grand wall of light curtain once again.</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai is immediately attracted to the past, just a little doubt about Lu Xueqi, suddenly forget. At this moment, in all people&rsquo;s eyes, there is only that black torrent, from far to near, surging and roaring, with the breath of death, rushing.</p>
<p>As if in a silent place a thunder, tearing heaven and earth, this time a huge bang, burst out in the black flood on the light curtain dam. The pressure of death seemed to be a little heavier in an instant. The broken bones fell like a drizzle again in an instant. The torn body was thrown into the air and punctured on the sharp claws.</p>
<p>The combat power of the huge monsters who joined the battle group was far more than that of the ordinary ones. In general, the magic weapons of human beings hit them in the right way, and they didn&rsquo;t work at all. And these monsters fly by with sharp claws, and it is a sea of bloody wind in an instant.</p>
<p>In a twinkling of an eye, the unprepared man in the right path was led by these seven or eight huge monsters, and broke through several holes. The whole curtain of light was on the verge of falling, and it was extremely hard.</p>
<p>At high altitude, the faces of Yun Yilan and master Pu Hong changed. Yun Yilan frowned and looked at immortal daoxuan. However, he looked at the battle situation at the foot of the mountain. The voice of the cry came. The corners of his eyes seemed to twitch. But somehow, there was no expression on his Qingyong face.</p>
<p>Cloud Yi Lan took back her eyes, silent for a moment, and looked down the mountain again.</p>
<p>The situation of the war became more and more fierce. All the righteous disciples above the sea of clouds knew that at the critical time, everyone was fighting to the death and doing their best. Even at this time, the hysterical roar of most people was almost the same as those of the beast demons. Maybe, even the Taoist practitioners, when facing the critical moment of life and death, were not much different from these animal demons? (to be continued. )</p>
