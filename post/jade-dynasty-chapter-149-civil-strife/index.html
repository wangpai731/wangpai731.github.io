      <p>The night gradually darkened, immersed in the invisible tension, the snake Valley seems to be slowly into sleep, dim lights slowly extinguished, except for the lonely soul hall.</p>
<p>The door of the shrine was still open, and the cold night wind blew through, blowing out the burning candles on the hall, casting strange shadows on the ground. In the distance outside, in the silence, it seems that there is something whispering, crying, laughing, and it seems that the wind is blowing the trees, which makes people not really listen to it, but feel a little chilly in their hearts.</p>
<p>In the night of the valley, a light mist, like smoke, floated around in the dark and shadow, changing its shape.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there is still only one Qin Wuyan who keeps vigil all night.</p>
<p>He was still kneeling in front of the spirit, his head bowed, his eyes wavering, as if he were looking at some unknown place. The copper basin in front of him was full of burnt paper money and black paper ash, which vibrated with the night wind blowing in from time to time. Occasionally, one or two pieces of scattered paper dust were blown up by the wind, left the copper basin and floated slowly in the room, and then most of them quietly fell back on the sacrificial table in front of the coffin, falling on the three animal tray.</p>
<p>Can you still have a pair of eyes looking at all this?</p>
<p>The footstep sound suddenly rang, stepped on the flat ground and walked into the spirit hall. Qin Wuyan&rsquo;s body shakes for a moment. Anyone can say that it&rsquo;s not a pleasant thing to hear the sound of footsteps behind him at this moment. He looked back with a frown and a little surprised. Obviously, the man who came was not in his expectation.</p>
<p>What he saw was a tall man, but his clothes were quite different from those of ordinary demon sect disciples. He was dressed in Taoist robes and had a square face. He was the worshiper of Cangsong Taoist priest in Wandu sect of the evil cult.</p>
<p>Qin Wuyan looks at Cangsong, Cangsong also looks at Qin Wuyan. Neither of them spoke. Then Cang song went straight to the front of the altar in front of the coffin, picked up the incense on the table, put it aside and lit it on a remnant candle. After a respectful salute to the throne, he took another step and put the incense candle in the censer.</p>
<p>Qin Wuyan watched Cangsong Taoist&rsquo;s every move patiently, from beginning to end, when Cangsong Taoist turned around again.</p>
<p>Qin Wuyan bowed his head slightly, which was regarded as a salute from his disciple. Although there was no expression on his face, his voice was still calm and said politely, &ldquo;thank you, Taoist priest. &quot;</p>
<p>Taoist Cangsong nodded and said, &ldquo;after all, I had a party with the old man. Although it was a little late for this incense stick, it was always my intention. &quot;</p>
<p>Qin Wuyan still knelt down and looked at the spirit throne. He said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s OK, Taoist priest, as long as he is sincere. Master must have a spirit in heaven, and he will be very happy. &quot;</p>
<p>The Taoist Cangsong gazed at Qin Wuyan for a while, then he suddenly laughed and said, &ldquo;Mr. Qin, you don&rsquo;t seem to like me all the time. &quot;</p>
<p>Qin Wuyan raised his eyes slightly. It seemed strange that Taoist Cangsong would suddenly ask such a question. However, after seeing Taoist Cangsong for a moment, he was still calm and said, &ldquo;Taoist priest misunderstood. You are the guest of the master&rsquo;s life. You are also a respected elder in the ten thousand poisons gate. You dare not be slighted by Wuyan. But now my teacher died unfortunately. I feel sad in my heart. If there is any disrespect and disrespect, please forgive me. &quot;</p>
<p>Taoist Cangsong still had a smile on his face, and his eyes slowly turned to the spirit throne of the poison God in front of him. Before that spirit throne, the box containing the seal of the master of the ten thousand poisons gate was quietly placed there. Cangsong Taoist looked at it for a while, and suddenly he heard a few low and strange calls. Qin Wuyan&rsquo;s face changed slightly, and Taoist Cangsong was stunned. But then he suddenly said with a smile, &ldquo;old master, you should be able to go safely. Look at what you have taught, and there is still such a good apprentice. It&rsquo;s not easy! &quot;</p>
<p>Qin Wuyan&rsquo;s face sank, and his eyes flashed. He said in a deep voice, &ldquo;Taoist priest, what do you mean? &quot;</p>
<p>Cang song Taoist turned his head and smiled, but he didn&rsquo;t speak. He just pulled up his wrist sleeve. Qin Wuyan&rsquo;s eyes pupil contract. He sees a small box attached to the arm of Taoist Cangsong. The strange sound just now comes out of it. It&rsquo;s clear and audible.</p>
<p>The as like as two peas on the wrist of the pines, they slowly put their hands to the front position. But when the box was placed close to the spirit box before placing the box on the door of the door, the sound of the insect was suddenly heard, but the sound was just like the sound from the box in the wrist of the pines. 。</p>
<p>Cangsong Taoist slowly took back his arm, turned his head and looked at Qin Wuyan. He said, &ldquo;seven tailed centipede? &quot;</p>
<p>Qin Wuyan inhaled deeply and closed his eyes. When he opened his eyes again, his eyes were full of vitality. Suddenly, he stood up from the ground, and his eyes were fixed on the Taoist Cangsong. He slowly repeated: &ldquo;seven centipedes! &quot;</p>
<p>After he stood like this, the originally dark and gloomy Lingtang suddenly seemed to be a little bright, and the original cold breath in the air disappeared in an instant. There were only fierce murders.</p>
<p>However, Taoist Cangsong could not see any fear. Instead, he seemed to feel nothing about the changes around him. He also asked Qin Wuyan with an air of dignity and said, &ldquo;if your master knew that his disciples were coming to his spirit shortly after his death, would he be very angry?&rdquo;? &quot;</p>
<p>Qin Wuyan snorted coldly and said, &ldquo;master, he is wise and intelligent. He has seen through the so-called etiquette and customs for a long time. Don&rsquo;t say that he is disrespectful to him in front of his spirit. It&rsquo;s just that our disciples fight with each other here, and most of his elders will laugh and watch the fun. &quot;</p>
<p>Taoist Cangsong nodded his head slowly and sighed suddenly. He said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s true. I&rsquo;ve been living with the old master day and night for the past ten years. I&rsquo;m afraid that&rsquo;s really the case with his character. He looked at Qin Wuyan and said with a smile, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe that you have followed him for the shortest time, but you are the one who knows him best among all the disciples. &quot;</p>
<p>Qin Wuyan looked the same, but he took a step forward and said coldly, &ldquo;Taoist priest, you are very good. Not only have you seen master clearly, but also I can&rsquo;t escape your eyes! &quot;</p>
<p>The smile on Cangsong Taoist priest&rsquo;s face was slightly stiff. His eyes took a glance at Qin Wuyan&rsquo;s steps, and suddenly said, &ldquo;is it over your master&rsquo;s seven now?&rdquo;? &quot;</p>
<p>Qin Wuyan is stunned. Taoist Cangsong suddenly asks what this sentence means. But tonight, this man&rsquo;s attitude is really strange and unpredictable. What&rsquo;s more, he has already seen through what he did on the seal letter of the door master. I&rsquo;m afraid he can&rsquo;t keep him. Qin Wuyan thought so. He said faintly, &ldquo;now is the ugly time. It has just passed. Why, is there any advice from the Taoist priest? &ldquo;And then he came closer to Taoist Cangsong.</p>
<p>Cang song Taoist priest then stepped back. He nodded his head and said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s good. Let your master pass the first seven safely. It&rsquo;s my wish.</p>
<p>&quot;</p>
<p>Qin Wuyan was stunned. Before he could understand, Taoist Cangsong suddenly moved. He flashed to the gate of the spirit hall. He raised his breath and said in a loud voice, &ldquo;eh, the master&rsquo;s seal Ah The first few words were full of consternation. Obviously, he was still in good condition, but Taoist Cangsong suddenly lost his voice and cried out as if he had been attacked by someone.</p>
<p>Qin Wuyan&rsquo;s face suddenly changed color, but there was no time to stop it. The voice of Taoist Cangsong was already reverberating in the quiet and deep poisonous snake valley. After a while, there seemed to be echoes in the distance, and there were faint &ldquo;ah&rdquo; voices all over the valley.</p>
<p>At the first moment, snake Valley seemed to be surprised by something, almost more dead than before. However, after a short time, countless noises were heard surging from all corners of poisonous snake Valley, like waves. However, countless people who had been waiting for the day jumped out. All kinds of questions, scolding, yelling and commanding were integrated into one, which turned into invisible waves, and poured into this hall from all directions.</p>
<p>Cangsong Taoist turned back with a smile and waved to Qin Wuyan, whose face was black and blue. He said, &ldquo;nephew, I&rsquo;ll help you with my uncle. If you can sit on the throne in the future, don&rsquo;t forget today&rsquo;s love! Then, without saying much, his figure swayed. A moment before Qin Wuyan rushed to the door, he quickly flew into the darkness outside the door and disappeared in a flash.</p>
<p>Qin Wuyan gasped by the door, his eyes full of anger. Obviously, Taoist Cangsong&rsquo;s sudden arrival completely disrupted his wishful thinking. At the moment, there was a lot of people around him. Seeing that the spirit hall was going to be surrounded by countless people from the three senior brothers, Qin Wuyan stamped his feet fiercely and made a quick decision. Just like Taoist Cangsong, he threw himself into the darkness outside the house, and after a moment he disappeared.</p>
<p>At the next moment, under the leadership of the three masters of poison God, countless murderous disciples of Wandu sect, holding torches and sharp blades, stormed into the spirit Hall of poison God.</p>
<p>But after a moment of silence, under the night in the snake Valley sounded the angry voice of killing, suddenly swept the whole valley.</p>
<p>The night is getting deeper and deeper.</p>
<p>When the rising sun threw the first light on the earth, Taoist Cangsong, who had been flying out of the poisonous snake Valley, had already controlled his sword and appeared above a small city 400 miles northeast of the poisonous snake valley. He looked around the town carefully in the sky, and then as if he had found something, he immediately fell down to a hill in the north of the city.</p>
<p>This nameless hill is mostly wild maple, from the sky, red as a piece, very beautiful. In front of the maple trees, there were three men and one woman standing at the moment. They were the king of ghosts, Mr. ghost, GUI Li and Youji.</p>
<p>Seeing the pines falling down, the ghost King&rsquo;s face showed a smile. He welcomed him and said with a smile, &ldquo;how is it going? &quot;</p>
<p>Taoist Cangsong nodded and said, &ldquo;as expected, Qin Wuyan&rsquo;s injury has recovered, and he has done something in the box sealed by the leader of Wandu sect. Most of the time, he put seven centipedes in it. No matter who opens the box, Qin Wuyan can&rsquo;t escape the bite of seven centipedes. With the strange poison of seven centipedes, most of them will die. &quot;</p>
<p>The king of ghosts laughed and turned to Mr. GUI and other humanitarians: &ldquo;you see, these local methods have been used countless times for a long time, but there are still people using them! &quot;</p>
<p>GUI Li was indifferent and said nothing. Youji kept silent. Only Mr. GUI said, &ldquo;the way is old-fashioned, but if it works, it&rsquo;s a good way. &quot;</p>
<p>The ghost King nodded and said, &ldquo;yes, the master poison God is also a generation of heroes in our holy religion. It&rsquo;s disappointing that all the apprentices are in this role. &quot;</p>
<p>Cangsong Taoist priest said with a smile, &ldquo;but Qin Wuyan is really a good character. It&rsquo;s a pity. &quot;</p>
<p>The ghost king looked at him and couldn&rsquo;t help laughing. The crowd didn&rsquo;t speak for a moment. GUI Li stood aside and looked at the ghost king in silence and frowned. I don&rsquo;t know why. He seems to think that ghost king is a little strange today.</p>
<p>However, this idea did not go deep, because soon, in front of that in the early morning just wake up in the small city, suddenly burst out a burst of heartrending screams. Soon, countless shrieks were heard everywhere, and one could hear clearly that someone was full of panic and yelled, &ldquo;demon, it&rsquo;s the monster &quot;</p>
<p>From the south side of the town came the shrill, cruel scream. Suddenly, clouds of smoke and dust appeared on the peaceful field in the distance, such as the soldiers who were charging and formed thousands of troops and horses, and rushed unstoppably. From far and near, the cry mixed with excitement and roar, and with bloodthirsty desire, the five ghost King Zong people standing at the other end of the town all rose up and flew to the town.</p>
<p>Flying close, Rao is people have seen countless big scenes, but the scene still makes them slightly change color.</p>
<p>Countless monsters and deviant monsters roared out of the dust in the field. The huge body, vigorous body, sharp teeth and claws, in the light of the morning, exudes a strong sense of death. On the other side of the town, the residents were panicked and frantic, but no one knew where to go?</p>
<p>The dense running sound was getting closer and louder, and finally reached the deafening level. More and more monsters came from the South and rushed to the small city. The ancient roads in the field and the wide land on both sides of the road have now become the paradise of these monsters. The Red Eyed Monsters surrounded the town in the roar of the sky shaking, and the poor people who had no time to escape into the city. In the twinkling of an eye, they were engulfed by the smoke and dust stirred up by monsters. In the gray fog, there was blood light flashing, and there was a scream coming out, and then annihilated.</p>
<p>And above the head of a small town. It seems that some of the monsters from the city will stop the fierce beasts from the south.</p>
<p>Five people in the sky took a breath.</p>
<p>In the distance, above the wilderness, came a shriek. The sound was sharp and harsh, but it was a little sonorous. It seemed to penetrate the sky and rush over the smoke. The ghost King changed his look and said in a low voice, &ldquo;here we are. It should be this monster. Be careful and act according to the original plan. &quot;</p>
<p>The rest of the crowd nodded slightly, and then scattered. Only the ghost King remained in the air, looked at the screeching sound a few more times, and his mouth showed a smile. Then he flew up and disappeared into the clouds in the sky.</p>
<p>As the scream grew louder and louder, countless monsters surrounded the town raised their heads and yelled at the same time. All kinds of harsh sounds mixed together, mixed with the smell of wild animals and the faint smell of blood in the wind, which made people creepy.</p>
<p>In the smoke and dust, suddenly there was a roar, and the scream came to an abrupt end. In the air, the brilliance flashed. Suddenly, there was a huge body, like a monster like a tiger leaping out of the smoke. From a distance, the monster looks like a tiger, and there seems to be a &ldquo;King&rdquo; on its forehead. However, its body is many times larger than ordinary tigers. It has sharp teeth and claws, and its fur is colorful. What&rsquo;s more, the tail behind it is extremely long, which seems to be much longer than its body. Compared with those fierce monsters around, they are just like kittens and puppies.</p>
<p>The ghost who was hiding outside the city frowned and said in a low voice, &ldquo;Chui! 」。</p>
<p>The small city surrounded by the herds of animals was just a small town. The monster beast with a height of five to six feet stood in front of the city, and almost all the tiger heads were built above the city. The strong smell of the wind blows, the people on the wall are either scared to be silly, or lose their souls and escape in general.</p>
<p>Chuwu roared two times, the fierce light in his eyes flashed, and he let out a sharp scream. He raised his thick front foot and directly hit the city gate. The sharp tiger&rsquo;s claws easily pierced the city gate made of thick wood. The civilians who fought to the death behind the gate did not know what was going on. Several of them had been pierced by giant tiger claws. The rest of the people ran away in panic.</p>
<p>Chuwu roared and his claws fell down one after another. &ldquo;Boom, boom, boom.&rdquo; after a few loud noises, the broken city gate collapsed, and the whole city burst into tears in an instant. The excited roar outside the city immediately rang out, and countless beasts swarmed in, and in a twinkling of an eye, it was bloody.</p>
<p>Chuwu opened the gate for other monsters, but he didn&rsquo;t go in to kill. It seemed that he didn&rsquo;t care to do such a thing. At this time, he seemed to find something. The tiger&rsquo;s head turned around slowly. His huge body slowly turned around. His nose kept sniffing into the air, as if he wanted to determine something.</p>
<p>When Chui was hesitating to find. Suddenly, from the city wall in front of it, there was a big bang, and the wall suddenly split, and Taoist Cangsong came out of the hole. Just in front of Chuwu, a yellow sword in his hand hit Chui&rsquo;s chest with lightning speed.</p>
<p>Chuwu let out an earth shaking roar, and the whole huge tiger flew backward. However, Taoist Cangsong was a famous figure for many years, and he learned from Qingyun, the first famous family in the world. Although Chuwu flies backwards, he hears the sound of silk cracking, and a huge wound over four feet long has been cut on Chuwu&rsquo;s chest.</p>
<p>If the ordinary monster was replaced, the wound would have been killed on the spot, but Chuwu is obviously different from the ordinary monsters around him. As one of the thirteen monsters under the zombie throne, its vitality and demonic methods are far beyond that of other ordinary monsters. Although the blood in my chest flowed out like a spring, Chui didn&rsquo;t even look at it and roared furiously. In the twinkling of an eye, he rushed over and looked at the body movement, which was not much slower than that before the injury.</p>
<p>Taoist Cangsong&rsquo;s face changed slightly, and his figure flashed. He dodged Chuwu&rsquo;s sharp claws. He quickly left the herd and flew to the north of the town. Chuwu roared, and his eyes were as if he wanted to burst out fire.</p>
<p>Cangsong Taoist wanted to fly to the unknown Hill quickly. Then he worked with several other people to get rid of the monster. Unexpectedly, he flew less than half a distance. He felt that the wind behind him was loud and the hot wind was almost in the back of his head. Taoist Cangsong was shocked. Looking back in a hurry, I was surprised to see that the speed of Chuwu was incredibly fast. After being injured, his feet were flying like fast wind and lightning. He even caught up with Taoist Cangsong who was flying with the sword.</p>
<p>Chuwu, who was behind the Taoist Cangsong, did not hesitate. He roared and opened his mouth and bit it off. It was hard to get rid of his hatred if he did not bite the Taoist Cangsong into two sections. But after all, Taoist Cangsong had been practicing for many years, and he was not flustered at the critical moment. He sank down fiercely and avoided the doom of being buried in Hukou. Rao is so, Cangsong Taoist is also out of a cold sweat.</p>
<p>Next, Taoist Cangsong did not dare to be careless any more. He drove the sword up and down, left and right, so that Chuwu could not run in a straight line to play his incredible speed. Only then did he run to the maple forest in the hill. At this time, Chuwu had been led away from the numerous beasts.</p>
<p>Seeing the green pine Taoist whizz, his body did not enter the red maple trees, Chui I more angry, straight to the maple trees. But at the moment when it stepped on the open space in front of the maple trees, Mr. ghost suddenly appeared with a black figure and whispered a mantra in his mouth. After a moment, his whole body was in black, and a strange spiritual power was slowly emanating from him.</p>
<p>Chuwu fiercely stopped the galloping steps. The huge momentum inertia made it slide forward a few feet, and washed down more than ten maple trees. However, Chuwu didn&rsquo;t care about the woods under him or even the Cangsong Taoist priest who had just disappeared. In his eyes, he only had the black figure floating around him and his strange spiritual power.</p>
<p>But this time, Chuwu didn&rsquo;t rush forward again. The huge tiger&rsquo;s head swung, but saw it roar, opened its mouth fiercely, and even three black smoke came out from its mouth. In the air, Chuwu quickly condensed into three ferocious skeletons with big knives in their hands, and rushed to Mr. ghost with open teeth and claws.</p>
<p>Mr. GUI&rsquo;s body is slightly shaken. This monster is not only ferocious and fast, but also has the weird magic method in southern Xinjiang. It is really worth noting.</p>
<p>However, Mr. ghost did not stop casting his own magic to avoid the magic skeleton offered by Chuwu. Sure enough, when the three skeletons could be rushed to the front of his eyes, the figures flashed, and Youji and GUI Li flew from both sides to block Mr. GUI. Youji&rsquo;s hands were intertwined, holding the strange Dharma seal. The palm was different from the Dharma seal of the Middle Earth Buddhism. In a moment, a beam of silver light appeared in the palm of her palm, which quickly magnified against a skeleton. The skeleton was like being burned and shocked. When it came, the skeleton suddenly scattered, and it was Youji&rsquo;s &ldquo;rosefinch seal&rdquo; that broke the spell.</p>
<p>On the other hand, he turned his right hand over and the magic wand appeared in his hand. However, he did not sacrifice the blood sucking beads as usual. On the contrary, he turned the black stick like a firecracker upside down and rushed forward with the black stick.</p>
<p>The two skeletons were cut down at the same time, but they were still less than three feet around the black stick. Under the urging of the strange magic method, a red light flashed all over the black stick. The stick body lit up immediately, and the black gas gushed. It was even more ferocious than those two skeletons. In a flash, the two skeletons collided with each other. The black sticks penetrated into the demon bodies of the two skeletons like tofu, and the black gas surged. After a moment, the two skeletons were in a state of darkness The skeleton opened its mouth, but could not make any sound. It dissipated quietly, and the remaining black gas was sucked in by the black stick.</p>
<p>In addition to the blood sucking beads and the original object of the stick, the ghost stick is the ancestor of these ghosts and demons, and also the natural killer. When the blood sucking old demon attacked Zhang Xiaofan with the skeleton array, he suffered a huge secret loss.</p>
<p>Chuwu obviously didn&rsquo;t expect that these people could break their own witchcraft so easily. He was stunned for a moment. At this time, Mr. GUI&rsquo;s practice was completed. His arms suddenly trembled, and a red light came down from the sky. It was Fu Long ding that was sacrificed by him. The sky was bright red, and there were birds singing and cow crowing in the red light. The voice was shrill, and his power seemed to be more powerful than before.</p>
<p>The red light fell like a curtain, and I was caged in it. Chuwu felt as if there was a mountain on his body, and he could hardly breathe. However, the monsters in southern Xinjiang were always fierce and fierce. Chuwu was deeply in adversity, but he was even more angry, roaring and struggling.</p>
<p>At this moment, the figure on the Fulong tripod flashed, and the ghost King fell from the sky, flying down in the red light of the Fulong Ding like lightning.</p>
<p>Chuwu seemed to be aware of it and raised his head in a rage. But the ghost king had reached its head and roared. The red light trembled and dazzled. The scene could not be seen clearly in the periphery. Only the ghost King&rsquo;s figure flickered, and something suddenly appeared on his hand.</p>
<p>Chuwu&rsquo;s body was shaking, shaking from head to foot. After a moment, the red light became quiet, and the mysterious things in the ghost King&rsquo;s hands disappeared. However, Chuwu&rsquo;s original lustrous fur suddenly faded, and all the seven orifices on the tiger&rsquo;s head bled. Ghost king a long smile, the right hand suddenly cut down, hard into Chuwu hard skull.</p>
<p>Chui gave out an earth shaking roar, and finally fell down.</p>
<p>Note 1: Chuwu in Shanhaijing Hainei Beijing: Lin&rsquo;s state-owned rare animal is as big as a tiger. It has five harvests and its tail is longer than its body. Its name is Chuwu, which travels thousands of miles every day.</p>
<p>Another note: there are strange animals in the south of Shenzhou, which are similar to tigers in shape, with long tail and five kinds of fur. They are called the king of beasts. (to be continued. )</p>
