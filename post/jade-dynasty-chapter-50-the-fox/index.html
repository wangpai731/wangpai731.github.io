      <p>Zhang Xiaofan stayed for a while. He didn&rsquo;t expect to see her again so soon. He didn&rsquo;t recognize her. But he finally lived and died in the blood hole of the dead soul pit. He had a strange feeling in his heart. He had to smile awkwardly and said, &ldquo;how can you come here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stone beside see Zhang Xiaofan look some strange, strange way: &ldquo;Xiaofan, who is this person?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan rushed out: &ldquo;she is&hellip;&rdquo; Suddenly, I realized that if someone knew the identity of Biyao and the relationship between myself and Biyao, I was afraid that the trouble would not be shallow, so I would go back to my mouth.</p>
<p>Stone heart is strange Zhang Xiaofan want to say and stop, but Bagao has smiled there: &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t ask him, I and he is a new acquaintance, but see one side, he also don&rsquo;t know my origin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stone understood this, but when he saw Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s face, he suddenly smiled strangely. He put his head to Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s ear and said softly, &ldquo;brother Zhang, I don&rsquo;t think you look right, is it interesting to this girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s surprise was extraordinary. His face turned white, and he said in a hurry, &ldquo;you mustn&rsquo;t say anything. I, I and she have nothing to do with each other!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Baguio stood there and looked at him with a smile. When she heard these two words, her face suddenly sank. She snorted and said with a sneer, &ldquo;yes, how could I have something to do with him, a shameless and despicable guy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everyone was stunned. When she saw Zhang Xiaofan just now, she was obviously surprised. Unexpectedly, her face turned faster than her book. In addition, she said &ldquo;shameless and despicable&rdquo;. For a while, everyone looked at Zhang Xiaofan strangely.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was embarrassed, but he didn&rsquo;t know how to distinguish them. But in anyone&rsquo;s eyes, they all thought it was a quarrel between a couple of little lovers, and they all laughed.</p>
<p>Stone looked at the sky and said to Zhang Xiaofan, &ldquo;brother Zhang, it&rsquo;s not early. Let&rsquo;s go in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan can&rsquo;t get away from this embarrassing scene. Hurriedly agreed, is talking, suddenly, Baguio but in the side of a drink: &ldquo;old liar. Stop for me! &quot;</p>
<p>They look back. It turns out that on Monday, Xianxian and Xiaohuan are going to slip away when everyone is not paying attention, but they are seen by Biyao, who is looking at the sad flowers in Biyao&rsquo;s hands, which are white and full of cold.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was startled and stopped at once, saying, &ldquo;wait a minute, how did they get on with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biyao glanced at Zhang Xiaofan and said coldly, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s none of your business!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan had a closed door and was depressed, but on Monday, Xian had just suffered a lot from Baguio. At the moment, it&rsquo;s hard to see someone come out for him. How can he let it go. Quickly said: &ldquo;little brother, you can save me. Just now, I was in the small town. I was kind enough to make a face for this girl. Unexpectedly, she couldn&rsquo;t listen to the truth. When she didn&rsquo;t do what she wanted, she started fighting against my grandparents and grandchildren&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>Baguio said angrily: &ldquo;nonsense, you old liar, full of nonsense, swindle, take advantage of people&rsquo;s money. Now you dare to accuse me and fight! &quot;</p>
<p>After that, the formula on the hand is condensed, and the sad flower is full of white light. The surrounding area is reflected like the daytime, and Zhang Xiaofan is eager to make a move. &ldquo;Biyao, wait a moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, Baguio didn&rsquo;t hear, let alone talk, for a moment. Sad flower left his hand and flashed again and again in the air. He only heard the sound of &ldquo;peeling&rdquo;. In a moment, the white light was dazzling, and the bright moon and stars in the sky lost their color together. He saw flying flowers all over the sky, brilliant and dazzling, full of fragrance and nose, whistling.</p>
<p>This is a rare spectacle. Unexpectedly, the immortal saw it in his eyes on Monday, but he was as frightened as a ghost. He turned his head and ran with a small ring. His right hand was still in his arms. He took out a piece of yellow paper. From a distance, it seemed that it was a kind of Rune paper used by folk Taoists to catch ghosts.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan once saw the power of this magic weapon of Biyao in the abyss of the dead spirit, and saw that the immortal on Monday didn&rsquo;t seem to understand the Taoism. He couldn&rsquo;t bear it. Finally, he stood up to block in front of the ancestor and grandson of the immortal on Monday. Before he was born, he had to help the immortal on Monday to block this for a while.</p>
<p>But when Biyao saw Zhang Xiaofan suddenly jump out, her eyebrows wrinkled, and her jade like face seemed to flick a smile, flying all over the sky, she suddenly stopped in the middle of the sky, and she was flying in front of Zhang Xiaofan, but she didn&rsquo;t move forward.</p>
<p>Only to see her face is still cold, cold way: &ldquo;what do you do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan took a look at her and lost three points in his heart. Nah, he said, &ldquo;they are not people who practice Taoism. Why do you bother them? Forget it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biyao snorted and waved her hand. The flying flowers all over the sky suddenly went back to her. However, under the brilliance of the stars and the moon, they became a white flower again and flew back to her hands: &ldquo;then why don&rsquo;t you ask him what&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan is also curious. Now he turns to Monday fairy and asks him whether Monday fairy is still vague. Unexpectedly, Bagao inserts a question beside her. It&rsquo;s all the key points. Zhang Xiaofan and stone all understand. It turns out that after Monday fairy made a fortune from the fat woman successfully, he is greedy. Seeing that Bagao&rsquo;s clothes are expensive, he ignores the small ring and blocks her eyes Stop, get together.</p>
<p>But the wisdom of Baguio is so great that he can not be compared with ordinary people. How could he deceive her in three or two sentences. At first, because of Xiaohuan&rsquo;s accurate view, she also said the past of Baguio was right. However, when Baguio inquired about it carefully, she could not tell the fairy on Monday directly. On Monday, the fairy was full of nonsense, which revealed the flaws. Baguio was furious, so she had to teach the old, the young and the young liars a lesson.</p>
<p>On Monday, immortal saw that the momentum was not right, and he actually got into a big trouble. He knew nothing about the cultivation of Taoism. But when qingyunzi was wandering in the Jianghu, he still had some skills to protect his life. Among them, there was a Taoist magic spell of earth escaping, which escaped for the time being. Unexpectedly, during the transmission, the cultivation was not enough and the direction could not be grasped, but it happened to fall near Zhang Xiaofan and the stone.</p>
<p>As for Biyao, she was the only daughter of the leader of the devil Kingdom sect at the beginning. How rare was she in the Jianghu? She only used magic to search around, and immediately found the old liar in this position. In an instant, she came after him.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan stayed for a moment, stared at the fairy on Monday and said, &ldquo;what you said to me in the daytime about the difficult future is also false?&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Monday, the fairy&rsquo;s eyes turned, but before he spoke, he heard that Baguio over there could not help laughing out: &ldquo;so you actually fell for him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This smile dissolved her cold look. Zhang Xiaofan felt embarrassed. He thought it was not worth starting for him this time, and he felt more ashamed in front of Biyao. Now that you&rsquo;ve made a face, go away.</p>
<p>On Monday, Xian was shocked and cried bitterly. When the stone nearby saw the embarrassing scene, he reminded Zhang Xiaofan, &ldquo;brother Zhang, let&rsquo;s go in. It&rsquo;s important to do business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan nodded. Then she ignored others and turned to enter the forest with the stone. After a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, Biyao said: &ldquo;the forest is full of demons. What are you two going to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan said, &ldquo;we are going to go in and get rid of demons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he pulled the stone. Step in quickly. Stone looked at the grandson and Bagao behind him, and followed them in. The scene immediately became cold. Biyao&rsquo;s face was cold. Looking back, on Monday, she immediately put her hand on her chest and tried to block it, but whether she could block it was another matter.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, Baguio did not start, pondered for a moment, but said to the fairy on Monday, &ldquo;what do they do in, do you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Monday, the immortal was stunned. During the day, he was also in Xiaochi town. Naturally, he knew the reason. He said, &ldquo;yes, there is a black stone hole in the forest. There is a three Tailed Fox in it. They are going to kill the demons for Xiaochi town. What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biyao snorted, her eyes slightly lowered, and her mouth murmured, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just a little bit of a Taoist, actually&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Monday, Xian saw her as if standing there in a daze. How can we let go of such a great opportunity as the way of thinking? Let&rsquo;s pull the small ring&rsquo;s hand and walk lightly. Wait for Biyao to come back. They had gone far, only to see a figure.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s still easy to catch up with Biyao&rsquo;s skill, but she doesn&rsquo;t seem to have this meaning. Instead, she turns around and looks at the dark forest in front of her. He was stunned.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan and the stone walked into the forest, but saw the trees were tall and straight, the branches and leaves were luxuriant, blocking the moonlight, and the forest was dark. Walking, there was silence all around. From the depths of the forest, it seemed that there was a light mist like a veil.</p>
<p>They looked at each other, and the stone whispered, &ldquo;be careful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan nodded, and both of them offered their magic weapons. They were alert and walked forward.</p>
<p>He walked for a while, but saw that the ancient trees in the forest were towering and the air was cloudy. It seemed that he had reached the depth of the forest. At this time, they suddenly heard a soft and sad voice from the fog floating in the forest:</p>
<p>Little Songgang, the moon like frost,</p>
<p>People like floating flocs are also hurt.</p>
<p>Ten years, three thousand years,</p>
<p>I hope we don&rsquo;t forget each other.</p>
<p>The female voice is gentle and soft. Although the figure is not seen, there is a sense of sadness. Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s face changed when he looked at the stone. In the middle of the night, he was in the desolate place. He was afraid that most of them were ghosts.</p>
<p>Then they walked carefully to the sound.</p>
<p>The mist drifted gently, gradually enveloping the figures of the two of them.</p>
<p>Just before they went in, the green shadow flashed, and Baguio appeared where they had just stood. Looking at the fog in the dark ahead, she frowned, thought for a while, and then threw herself into it.</p>
<p>At night in the forest, I was in a trance in the dark. Occasionally, there was a few inches of moonlight, falling from the gap of the leaves on the top of my head, shining on the Bush, shaking gently.</p>
<p>Around, as if only the distant low insect chirp.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the stone caught Zhang Xiaofan. Zhang Xiaofan was shocked and said, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; whispered the stone</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan listened attentively, only heard a faint sigh, floating from the front.</p>
<p>A moonlight, like a bright light in the dark, a frost bloom, gently illuminated, reflecting the fog there, gently drifting. In the dark, a woman in white walked out slowly, stood in the light, and looked at them faintly.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan and the stone held their breath.</p>
<p>That is a very soft and beautiful woman, long and straight hair is not curled up, draped on the shoulders, as soft as water; white skin, there are graceful eyebrows, delicate nose, red lips light, eyes wave like water, looked over, but like water, saw their inner depth.</p>
<p>She was a woman who seemed to be distressed at first glance. She stood there timidly, in the moonlight, staring at them.</p>
<p>Time, as if also stopped at that moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you came to kill me?&rdquo; She asked quietly.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was shocked by the stone. When the stone bit his lower lip, he calmed down and said, &ldquo;are you the three evil foxes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her eyes were like water. She glanced at the stone and saw it on Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s face. At that moment, Zhang Xiaofan felt like a gentle hand caressing his face.</p>
<p>He was surprised. He didn&rsquo;t expect that there was such a charming woman in the world. It&rsquo;s not like human beings.</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t answer. Only slightly frown, as if there is a kind of sadness, engraved in her light eyebrows.</p>
<p>She looked up at the moon again, but there was no time to see it. Hang in the sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s me.&rdquo; She&rsquo;s a quiet tunnel.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>The night was deep, and there seemed to be something in the darkness behind her, fluttering quietly.</p>
<p>The stone sank down, and the huge golden mace in his hand was &ldquo;broken.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Gradually, the trees around it seemed to be golden. Zhang Xiaofan is standing beside him, also breathing deeply.</p>
<p>But the woman didn&rsquo;t seem to have any big reaction. At a glance, she moved her steps slightly and walked to the side. The white sleeve robe waved gently. They saw the Bush move away, but a well came out. From a distance. The stone beside the well is old and green, which seems to be quite old.</p>
<p>She went to the well, looked down, and gently combed her hair with her hands.</p>
<p>When they saw that she was acting strangely, they did not dare to move.</p>
<p>Only listen to the voice of the woman floating in this forest, said: &ldquo;this is an ancient well of three thousand years, legend, as long as in the full moon night, with devout wishes, look down on it. We must be able to get what we want. &quot; In her voice, it seemed a little sad, &ldquo;but from here. After seeing it three times, why is his illness still not improving? &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan and stone look at each other stunned, look at her look and speech, clearly is a sad woman trapped by love, but stone in these things is more firm than Zhang Xiaofan. Frown, step forward, when the wind in the woods began to rise, angry way: &ldquo;shameless monster, dare to confuse the world, come and die quickly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman turned around and looked at the two of them like water eyes, ignoring the stones, but looked at Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s eyes more often. Suddenly she said softly, &ldquo;is there a woman who is deeply concerned in your heart? Come and have a look. &quot;</p>
<p>When the wind blows through the trees, the chill suddenly rises.</p>
<p>The branches on the top of the tree are rustling.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s heart was confused, but he could not help but step forward.</p>
<p>The stone was startled, not to mention much. The whole man rose up in the air. He saw the golden light of breaking evil. He let out a roar in the air. He fell down on the woman and looked at the rapid trend. He was not a delicate woman, but a strong man who also made meat sauce.</p>
<p>But the woman&rsquo;s body seemed to be like a fallen leaf, which was blown up by the strong wind of breaking evil spirit, and she drifted back to avoid the shock of the stone. Then, she was floating in the middle of the sky, her sleeves were flying, and suddenly opened. In a moment, the forest was full of demons, and the demons were roaring. In the darkness behind her, at the same time, countless ferocious eyes opened at the same time.</p>
<p>When the stone was in focus, it just listened to countless howls, and the black pressed a fierce shadow, leaped out of the darkness, and over the white figure of the woman, &ldquo;shoosh, shoosh, shoosh, shoosh, shoosh, and claw to the stone.</p>
<p>But the woman, at the moment, did not look at the stone, a pair of soft eyes, only looking at Zhang Xiaofan who approached the ancient well step by step.</p>
<p>The moon shines on him like frost or snow.</p>
<p>Deep in heart, can there be a deep memory of people?</p>
<p>He is infatuated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Xiaofan!&rdquo; A exclamation came from behind. Baguio flashed out and flew quickly. She said in a hurry, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment, Zhang Xiaofan seemed to be slightly stunned, floating in the middle of the air and looking at his charming woman, his face also slightly changed.</p>
<p>But then he looked down.</p>
<p>So, I looked down deeply.</p>
<p>The wind stopped and everyone held their breath.</p>
<p>What on earth did he see?</p>
<p>With a loud roar of the stone, the demons from the siege are shaken away. The huge body grabs the magic weapon and breaks the evil spirit. The red light on the face flashes again and again. In a moment, the face seems to be bleeding. He rushed up for a long time, and suddenly fell down. He was like an arrow flying from the string. With a &ldquo;poof&rdquo; sound, he broke the evil spirit and plunged into the land. At the same time, he gave out a loud drink in his mouth:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Broken!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The whole world seemed to be still for a moment.</p>
<p>All the land within two cubits of the square suddenly sank down, and the trees on the top seemed to be pulled deep into the ground by the invisible giant hand. Only near the ancient well where Zhang Xiaofan is, the land and trees are not affected.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, the whole staff is brilliant as if it were inhaled. With the sound of the word &ldquo;broken&rdquo; in the stone, countless lights come out of the way. They are as fast as lightning. Those black ghosts flying in the mid air will scream and scream for a while. The demons that are shot will either fall to the ground or simply evaporate into nothing.</p>
<p>As soon as the soft woman&rsquo;s face changed, her face seemed to turn white, and she said, &ldquo;absorb the essence of civil engineering and kill the evil spirit force, and break the evil spirit staff!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stone solves the demons around him. At the first time, it looks at Zhang Xiaofan. Biyao stops and looks at him.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan raised his head slowly, his face didn&rsquo;t seem to be abnormal, but he was vaguely confused. Then he seemed to wake up, breathe deeply, stand beside the stone, and face the soft woman floating in the air.</p>
<p>The woman looked at him deeply and suddenly said, &ldquo;what do you see?&rdquo; (to be continued. )</p>
