      <p>This past event of Biyao seems to her to be a deep pain. She has been deeply buried in her heart in recent years. Unexpectedly, at this critical moment of life and death, she looks back again. Her mind is agitated. In addition, her food is scarce and her body is weak these days. She has been in a coma for a long time.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan looks at the young devil cult girl who is still clinging to her sleep. He shakes his head and grins bitterly. Not long ago, he was a patient who came back from a circle at the juncture of the ghost gate. Unexpectedly, at this time, it&rsquo;s her turn to be Biyao&rsquo;s disease. It&rsquo;s hard not to die for these two people to fall down first and then.</p>
<p>After another while, Zhang Xiaofan was drowsy, but he sat up straight on his own. Because Biyao was lying in his arms at the moment, looking at her haggard and slightly painful face, Zhang could not bear to leave.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not easy to sit like this. He sat on the platform with one foot hanging in the air and one foot stepping on the ground, half reclining. His body was quite straight and there was no place to lean on. After a long time, the body was sore everywhere. Especially where Biyao tightly grasped him, her fingers were strong. After she passed out of sleep, the strength was not reduced, and it really hurt into the bone marrow. Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s temper was also Stoic. He bit his teeth and endured it. He changed people, just afraid that he would jump up early.</p>
<p>However, Rao is so guilty. Zhang Xiaofan cried in his heart, but after all, he didn&rsquo;t leave. After a long time, his sleepiness also came up, and he sat and dozed in the pain and ache of numbness.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan stretches and wakes up, feeling pain all over his body. He is sighing. Suddenly, he finds that he is lying on the platform without knowing when, but the original Bi Yao is gone.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was shocked. He stood up and looked around. There was still no shadow of Biyao in the cave. It&rsquo;s so empty that there&rsquo;s not even a sound. Suddenly, Zhang Xiaofan felt a chill in his heart, just like a person suddenly staying in the grave. He frowned. Stand up, do not want to, then began to look for Bagao.</p>
<p>After looking for the Tianshu stone room, I went to the treasure room again, but I didn&rsquo;t see the figure of Biyao. Zhang Xiaofan thought for a moment and walked out. It wasn&rsquo;t long before he saw the figure of Biyao in the stone room where the two evil spirits of the demon sect were enshrined.</p>
<p>In front of the kind-hearted virgin and ferocious tianshaming throne, Biyao knelt on the ground, her shoulders raised, and though she tried to suppress it, she still made a low choking voice.</p>
<p>She was crying.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan stayed in the local area, no matter how he imagined it, he would not think of the strong and competitive witch cult woman crying secretly in front of the statue. He stands there. At that time, I was at a loss, but after all, I walked slowly, hesitated and said: &ldquo;you, er, you, how do you Don&rsquo;t cry! &quot;</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, it&rsquo;s OK that he didn&rsquo;t speak. When he heard his words, the originally unbearable sadness suddenly broke out in Biyao&rsquo;s heart. His voice immediately rose a lot, crying loudly and slowly raising his head. The original Jade also seems on the face, also hung the Pearl like tears at the moment.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was stunned. He himself was just a teenager. How to understand the thoughts of these daughters&rsquo; families. At once, I was in a hurry. It seemed that Biyao was crying because of him. I even stuttered: &ldquo;you, you don&rsquo;t, this, this way I, I, no, you, No. I mean, I&hellip;&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>Biyao&rsquo;s eyes were misty with tears. Seeing Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s busy appearance, she shook her head and clenched her teeth. However, she could not bear the heartbreak. After enduring the tears for more than ten years, they burst out today.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s me. I killed my mother!&rdquo; This is a woman deeply trapped in the painful past, with some sadness and sadness.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan immediately shook his head and looked at her fragile and helpless figure. He felt a trance in his heart. It was like seeing the same helpless figure many years ago: &ldquo;no,&rdquo; he went up and said in a low voice, soft voice, &ldquo;your mother is the one who loves you the most. At that time, you were still small and didn&rsquo;t understand anything. How could you harm others?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biyao choked, &ldquo;but Dad always hates me. I know he hates my death. He blames me for killing his mother!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan whispered, &ldquo;no, don&rsquo;t think about it. Didn&rsquo;t your father blame you? Didn&rsquo;t he come to save you? Has he ever been bad to you these years?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biyao&rsquo;s body shakes for a while, as if her face is white. Zhang Xiaofan looks from here. Her original beautiful face, pear blossom with rain, and the feeling of sad place, are also moving.</p>
<p>But she raised her head, behind the tears, looked at Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s eyes, but Zhang Xiaofan did not dare to look directly, turned away his eyes.</p>
<p>After a long time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re fine.&rdquo; All of a sudden, she was so quiet.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan felt deeply, didn&rsquo;t know where, suddenly jumped, immediately calmed down, smiled: &ldquo;no, but we are going to die together. It&rsquo;s nothing to comfort you before we die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biyao slowly stopped crying, wiped away tears from her eyes, sighed in a low voice, and said, &ldquo;yes, we are going to die together.&rdquo; Speaking of this, she suddenly thought of something and said to Zhang Xiaofan, &ldquo;have you ever regretted that you and I died here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was stunned for a moment, and suddenly his mind turned to countless pictures, as if at this moment, he went back to Qingyun Mountain and dazhufeng, &ldquo;I naturally regret it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was so deep.</p>
<p>After hearing this, Biyao&rsquo;s face immediately sank and said, &ldquo;hum, I don&rsquo;t know how many people want to die with me in the holy religion, but you just don&rsquo;t think about it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s anger went up, but he took a look at Biyao. Suddenly his anger went away again. He just sighed and shook his head and said, &ldquo;maybe, but if I could bury myself on the bamboo peak, I would die without complaint.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biyao&rsquo;s face was gloomy, and she stared at him. She was silent for a long time. Suddenly she said, &ldquo;are you for your elder martial sister ling&rsquo;er?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan jumped up, pointed to her and said, &ldquo;you, how do you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turning to the beginning, Baguio said, &ldquo;you said it some time ago when you were seriously ill and talked nonsense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan stayed, just wanted to say something to blame her, but on second thought, seeing that he and she were going to die here, not only could he not see elder martial sister from now on, but even after he died, he would be transformed into a spirit, and he could not see the scenery of dazhufeng!</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t know. Can elder martial sister remember me?</p>
<p>He thought of it here. All of a sudden, frustrated and cold, a long sigh, the deep sense of grief is hard to extricate themselves. Turn around and walk out. Looking at his back, Biyao was stunned.</p>
<p>After a long time, she slowly turned around, looked at the two statues, and bowed down: &ldquo;Virgin mother. May you have compassion on the world, protect him and protect him. I hope you will hold the power of opening up the sky and save him&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>Her voice suddenly stopped, and the whole person lay on the ground, motionless. At that moment, it seemed as if all around was quiet, but in her mind, it was like the sea of waves. And a glimmer of light flashed in the waves, but loomed, and she tried to catch it and think of it.</p>
<p>She slowly raised her head and carefully looked to the statue of Tiansha Mingwang at her right hand. Over and over again, she had an idea in her heart and cried out loudly, &ldquo;no, no, there is something missing from the statue&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at it over and over again, not daring to breathe. Finally, her eyes fell on the empty right hand of the statue.</p>
<p>She jumped up and couldn&rsquo;t help but rejoice. She cried out, &ldquo;open axe. Yes, where&rsquo;s the axe? &quot;</p>
<p>According to the legend of demon religion, the virgin of Youming is the God who nurtures thousands of creatures, while the king of Tiansha is the God who opens the world and controls the punishment, which is quite different from Pangu, the ancient giant God. It is said that the emperor Tiansha Mingwang was holding a &ldquo;giant axe&rdquo;. Therefore, later generations for its statue must also have this huge axe appearance. But the right hand of the statue was empty. Biyao knew that among the demons, Emperor Tiansha Mingwang was one of the two great gods, and no one would deliberately disrespect him. The blood refining hall, which was built in the beginning, was also a sect of the demons, which must have a reason.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan went back to the cave, sat on the platform, speechless, and was thinking of the place where she was on the bamboo peak. Suddenly, she saw Biyao with a happy face and rushed in. When she saw him sitting there, she said in a loud voice, &ldquo;if you want to live, come here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Zhang Xiaofan was shocked, but saw that Baguio rushed into the treasure room on the right side like a gust of wind. He hesitated for a moment, but finally he could not resist the desire for life and followed in. Just after stepping into the stone room, I heard a cheer from Bagao. I saw Bagao laboriously picking up a huge iron axe from a pile of iron garbage. It was very hard to see her. It should be very heavy.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan ran over and helped her hold the axe. He thought it was very heavy to start with it. Both of them couldn&rsquo;t bear it. He was surprised and said, &ldquo;what are you doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you want to live, you can help me to move this iron axe to the statue,&rdquo; said Biyao</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan took a breath of cool air and said: &ldquo;you, what are you going to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biyao is too lazy to say more. He drags the axe to go, but he doesn&rsquo;t walk a few steps. Zhang Xiaofan gasps. Zhang Xiaofan shakes his head and sighs, but he finally goes there. They work together and spend nine cows and two tigers to drag the axe to the stone chamber where the statue is. Then Zhang Xiaofan turns his eyes. He is unwilling to hear Biyao say that he wants to take this heavy guy Put it in the hands of the evil god.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s suspicions that he was the eldest one in his heart were originally. Now he heard that he was going to work for the evil spirits of the demon sect, and he was very angry. However, he still couldn&rsquo;t help Biyao. Seeing her sweating and working hard alone, he thought that it would be better to finish one of her wishes before he died, so he went forward and helped her as much as he could,.</p>
<p>The axe looks huge. Now it&rsquo;s actually carried, and the weight is even more incredible. After two people have no food for a long time, they miraculously finish the seemingly impossible task. After they put the axe on the right hand of the emperor Tiansha Mingwang, Zhang Xiaofan sat on the ground, gasped and said: &ldquo;you, Huhu, you, if you can&rsquo;t find a way out, Huhu, yuan We could have lived for three days, now there are only three hours left. &quot;</p>
<p>Biyao also gasped for breath, but the excitement in her eyes couldn&rsquo;t be concealed. After a short rest, she went to the statue and observed it carefully for a while. After adding a huge axe to the statue, she was really powerful and powerful. She gave a respectful salute to the God of the Ming Dynasty and said, &ldquo;master Ming, please forgive my disciples for being rude.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she reached for the axe and shook it tentatively, up and down, but there was no movement. Originally, the axe was put in by herself. If there was any movement, there was just now. Zhang Xiaofan sat on the ground and watched her strange movements and shook her head.</p>
<p>Biyao frowns tightly. In a low voice: &ldquo;why not? The mechanism is here&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was anxious when he spoke. He had more strength in his hand and moved his axe. Unexpectedly, the right hand of the statue of Tiansha Mingwang also moved a minute. Suddenly, in the stone room, it seemed that there was a heavy organic sound.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan jumped up, and Biyao was even more delighted. They looked at each other, and Zhang Xiaofan ran over. Together with Biyao, they grabbed the axe and pulled it hard. They saw that the axe was lifted to the mid air from a low state with the right hand of emperor Tiansha Mingwang. A moment later, there was a deafening roar in the stone chamber.</p>
<p>The second person was shocked and only felt the roar in his ear. It&rsquo;s hard to bear the pain, so I pressed my hand on my ear. After another moment, the roar was still heard, but on the stone wall behind the statue, the huge and hard stone wall slowly retreated to both sides, revealing a channel to come out, step by step and up the stone steps, all the way up to the dark place ahead.</p>
<p>At this time, the stone chamber where the statue is located suddenly vibrated violently.</p>
<p>There were stones falling on their heads. They hardly spoke. They ran to the stone steps at the same time and threw themselves into the darkness.</p>
<p>Actually, 800 years ago. When the blood refining Hall of the demon cult built the blood dripping hole, it had considered the situation of being attacked by the enemy in case of decline in the future, so it built this passage in the hinterland of the middle mountain of the stone chamber. Once the enemy attacked, it would escape by this way. After a while, the blood dripping hole will collapse, burying the enemy and countless secrets of the blood refining hall together.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan and Biyao run hard. They only hear the loud noise and the stones flying. If they jog a step, they are afraid they will die here. They really take out their last strength and run forward. They didn&rsquo;t run far. It was dark in front of them. In the narrow and dark secret Road, they fell many times and bumped many times. They only heard the roar and roar around them. The stones flew like the whole mount Kong Sang was angry. They vibrated a lot. But finally, with a desire for survival, they saw a ray of light in front of them.</p>
<p>The entrance of the secret cave was originally opened in the middle of kongsang mountain. Under a cliff in the shadow of the mountain, the trees are luxuriant and very secret. No wonder no one has seen it for 800 years. Most of the descendants who want to come to the blood refining hall today don&rsquo;t know about it.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan and Biyao stumbled out. Almost at the moment when they fell to the ground, they only heard the roar of &ldquo;roar&rdquo;. The huge rocks weighed down and the dust was flying. They blocked the hole tightly. From now on, no one can see the secret in the mountain.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Crawling on the ground, Zhang Xiaofan gasps for breath. His fingers are tightly holding the grass on the ground. It&rsquo;s a taste of running on the edge of life and death. It&rsquo;s really breathless. For a long time, his mood relaxed slowly. He raised his head and looked to the side. He saw that Biyao was beside him. The white face had some light dust at the moment, as if she felt Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s look. She also turned to look over.</p>
<p>The joy of rebirth slowly emerged in their faces. Biyao&rsquo;s lips moved, as if there were waves of water flowing in her bright eyes, crystal clear in the hazy. She gave a little choking shout, a relief after the infinite pressure, and could not think of anything else, except that the sky was very blue, the mountains were so high, the wind was blowing, the mountains were dripping green, the shadows were whirling, the trees were surging, and the world was full of moving beauty Li.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We, we survived!&rdquo; She cheered, facing the blue mountains and the blue sky.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan laughed loudly, beside her, watching her open arms, showing the most beautiful smile in the world.</p>
<p>In the crackling sound, the fire devoured the wood, made a crisp sound, and emitted light smoke. Biyao sat beside the fire, watching Zhang Xiaofan clean up a newly caught wild rabbit with a thick branch, and then put it on the fire to bake. As the fire burned, the rabbit meat gradually became golden yellow, and the oil particles also condensed into water drops, dripping down.</p>
<p>Under the mountain forest, a delicious fragrance, overflowing. She was very hungry in the cave. Biyao couldn&rsquo;t help her saliva and saliva, but Zhang Xiaofan was not in a hurry. She looked at the fire, reached out to her waist habitually, and suddenly she was stunned, and then her face brightened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; said Biyao</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan happily took out a small bag from his waist and said with a smile, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine that all the dry food has been lost, but these things are still there. I haven&rsquo;t paid attention to them in the last few days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Biyao looked at the small bag, Zhang Xiaofan carefully opened the package and revealed several small bottles and jars. He was curious. He picked up some of them and smelled them. Then he was stunned and looked at Zhang Xiaofan, who could hardly speak: &ldquo;this, these are salt spices&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan smiles. &ldquo;Yes, I always take it with me when I go down the mountain. I&rsquo;m afraid that if I stay in the wild, I can make some delicious food. I didn&rsquo;t expect it would be useful today. &quot;</p>
<p>Biyao looks up and down at Zhang Xiaofan. He can&rsquo;t speak for a while. He carefully sprinkles these things that don&rsquo;t know whether they are spiced or salted on the rabbit meat. Then he slowly turns the branches and bakes them. The air is more and more fragrant. She had never met such a man of integrity. Unexpectedly, he came out and put the seasoning on him. It seems that he is a cook more than a disciple from a famous and decent school.</p>
<p>After a while, Zhang Xiaofan sniffed and said, &ldquo;OK, you can eat it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Baguio had been waiting for a long time, but felt that the fragrance almost seemed to be all pervasive. She put in all the pores on her body. When she smelled it, her body seemed to float. It&rsquo;s a lot lighter. As for the mouth, let alone the mouth. If it&rsquo;s not carefully hidden, I&rsquo;m afraid that even the voice of belly &ldquo;cooing&rdquo; will be heard by this kid.</p>
<p>At that moment, Zhang Xiaofan was very kind, and finally said that it was finished. A golden and fragrant rabbit in front of him was almost drooling. He could not help but stretch out his hand, but he forgot for a while. A touch of the hand changed &ldquo;ah&rdquo;, retracted back, but was burned.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan said with a smile, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t worry!&rdquo; Then he took the branch away from the fire and moved it up and down. Let the grease flow down, the temperature on the meat is lower, so I carefully tear off a rabbit&rsquo;s hind leg, hand it to Biyao, and smile: &ldquo;eat it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biyao immediately reached out and took the rabbit. Just as he was about to open his mouth, he suddenly saw a gentle smile on Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s face, and looked at his smile. The sunlight in the forest came down through the thick leaves, bit by bit, and some fell on his face, which was so bright.</p>
<p>For some reason, she blushed suddenly, turned her head, turned her back to Zhang Xiaofan, and began to eat. Zhang Xiaofan was stunned for a while, but he didn&rsquo;t care. He was already hungry. He tore off another rabbit&rsquo;s leg and chewed it up.</p>
<p>After eating half of it, he suddenly saw Biyao turn around and look at him. He was slightly surprised and said, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter? By the way, is this meat delicious?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is a faint red halo on Biyao&rsquo;s face. The light wind from the deep forest gently sweeps her long soft hair and brushes her white face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s delicious, eh&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan: &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biyao: &quot; I&rsquo;m done. &quot;</p>
<p>Her face has a touch of gentleness, a trace of secluded shyness. Zhang Xiaofan opens his mouth slightly, but he is infatuated.</p>
<p>Biyao lowered her head slightly. Suddenly, they were silent. For a while, Zhang Xiaofan suddenly woke up and said, &ldquo;ah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was sweating on his head and stuttering in his mouth. He could not say: &ldquo;I, I didn&rsquo;t look, no, you look at me Ah, no, ah, here you are. &quot;</p>
<p>Say close eyes, rabbit leg handed past, somehow, unexpectedly dare not open eyes.</p>
<p>But for a long time, Bagao seemed to have no movement. Zhang Xiaofan summoned up his courage and slowly opened his eyes. When Bagao looked at him, his face looked like a smile, but his eyes were gentle. There was an indescribable charm. He said with a low ground and a smile: &ldquo;would you like to give this to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan did not understand. He looked into his hands. His face was red and his ears were red. He was helpless. What he handed to Biyao was half of the rabbit&rsquo;s legs that he was holding in his right hand. Most of the rabbit&rsquo;s meat was put by his left hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, no&hellip;&rdquo; Zhang Xiaofan was so embarrassed that he took back the shameful rabbit leg like lightning and handed over the intact rabbit meat. He said: &ldquo;I am, I am, I want to&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo; Baguio took the rabbit, tore off a piece of meat and put it into his mouth, chewed it gently. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s delicious. The best thing I&rsquo;ve eaten in my life is the rabbit you bake now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s heart leaped, and saw the beautiful and beautiful face of Biyao, half smiling, half speaking seriously. He was afraid to look at it again. He bit half of the rabbit&rsquo;s leg with his mouth and buried himself in it.</p>
<p>The rabbit was soon wiped out by the two hungry people. For the first time in many days, it&rsquo;s really fun. Biyao finds a mountain stream. They wash it by the water, but they are sleepy. In other words, the nerves in the mountainside have been tight, I just feel that I have been walking on the edge of life and death, so I come out, the whole person is relaxed and sleepy.</p>
<p>First of all, Bagao couldn&rsquo;t support her. She lay down on a small green lawn beside the stream, and Zhang Xiaofan felt sleepy. She lay down beside her, but she felt the sun was warm and gently sprinkled on them. She couldn&rsquo;t help looking back at Bagao. I saw the washed Baguio, although her hair was still a little messy, but her face was as white as jade when I first met her. Her skin was as white as snow, and she could almost burst by blowing. Now she closed her eyes and lay there quietly. The breeze blew, and her hair tips moved gently. In the sun, they emitted a soft light.</p>
<p>Suddenly, in her deep sleep, Biyao seemed to see something, her brow slightly wrinkled, her right hand stretched out habitually, grabbed Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s shoulder, snuggled up beside him, and then, by her lips, she fell asleep with a light smile, so relieved.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan stayed, but looked at her haggard but still beautiful face, but in any case did not have the courage to take her hand away, he lay there motionless, gradually, his sleepiness also came up, closed his eyes, as if also forgot this matter, as if it was normal again, and went to sleep peacefully.</p>
<p>The breeze in the forest still blows gently, through the treetops, through the green leaves, through the quiet flowing streams, with gentle ripples. Finally, it blows over these two young people. (to be continued. )</p>
