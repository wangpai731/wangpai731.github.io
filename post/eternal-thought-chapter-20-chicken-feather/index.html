<p>I&rsquo;d like to present today&rsquo;s update. By the way, I&rsquo;d like to draw a vote for the &ldquo;starting point&rdquo; 515 fan Festival. Everyone has 8 tickets. I&rsquo;d like to give you some money to vote for!</p>
<p>The body of Lingwei chicken is much larger than that of ordinary domestic chicken. Its feathers are hard and its habit is fierce. It can be compared with the second layer of condensate gas after adulthood. [love to go to the small</p>
<p>Because poultry meat is edible, eggs can be nourishing, blood and bone can be used as medicine, especially the tail, which is a rare three color fire burning. Therefore, this Lingwei chicken is widely raised in the three mountains on the South Bank of Lingxi.</p>
<p>However, it was not owned by the clan, but was the personal property of Li Qinghou and the other two mountains. His disciples specially raised them. On this Xiangyun mountain, three areas were enclosed for the breeding of Lingwei chicken.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun squats in the grass and looks at those Lingwei chickens. He has never seen any live chickens before in the fire kitchen, but he knows that the meat is very delicious. He also hears from Zhang daphou that this chicken likes to eat spirit insects.</p>
<p>After a long time, he didn&rsquo;t move lightly. He chose to go down the mountain and exchange a bag of spirit insects with the few spirit stones left. Then he returned to the yard.</p>
<p>As soon as he came back, his stomach was hungry again. He tried to resist dizziness. Bai Xiaochun went back and forth to look for some materials.</p>
<p>After a while, when he saw the Lingdong bamboo, his eyes suddenly brightened. These bamboos have now grown to more than ten feet in length, and they are thick and thin fists. They are very smart. They look extraordinary.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun quickly stepped forward and looked around the bamboo for a few times. With a smile, he took off two pieces of the hardest bamboo head in a Lingdong bamboo according to her knowledge of plants and plants.</p>
<p>For how to steal chicken, Bai Xiaochun has a special way. The key point of stealing chicken is to steal a word. How not to be found is a knowledge.</p>
<p>Using these two pieces of bamboo, he quickly made a bamboo cicada.</p>
<p>He learned it from his father when he was a child. It is said that it is a sharp weapon to kill a chicken and a phoenix when meeting a chicken. Then he weaves a rope with bamboo silk. After trying hard, he connects the bamboo cicada with the rope and flies out in the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to eat chicken!&rdquo; All the way, his stomach was cooing, but Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s eyes were full of green light. This state of hunger made him faster and went straight to the nearest place where the chicken was raised.</p>
<p>When he approached, he slowed down and crept close to the fence. He threw the bamboo cicada with the spirit insect in his hand. He squatted on the side, holding the rope connected with the bamboo cicada, and waited with hunger.</p>
<p>There are some wooden houses in the palisade, and there are disciples of other schools living in the distance. As for the large breeding yard, there are hundreds of Lingwei chickens. Most of them climb there, and a few of them walk back and forth. Sometimes they look up arrogantly and have a good temperament. Soon, a spirit tail chicken seems to notice something. It turns to look at the place not far away. After passing by, it immediately sees the spirit insects He opened his mouth and pecked at it.</p>
<p>But at the moment when the chicken pecked at the insect, it seemed to touch the mechanism. The bamboo that was bent suddenly bounced open. It was very clever and directly stuck the mouth of the chicken, supporting it up and down, so that the chicken&rsquo;s mouth was forced to open.</p>
<p>Lingwei chicken wants to make a sound, but its mouth is stuck, and it can&rsquo;t make any sound. It wants to crush the bamboo in its mouth, but the bamboo is extremely tough and useless. At the same time, a strong force comes from the bamboo.</p>
<p>No matter how the chicken struggles, it can only be quickly pulled without a sound. After running straight to the fence, the rope shakes, the Lingwei chicken is immediately pulled up and caught by Bai Xiaochun. His cultivation of four layers of condensing Qi is condensed in his hands. He has more tough skin and great strength. He twists the chicken neck and throws it into the storage bag. This is a very skillful move, which can be seen from a glance Old hand.</p>
<p>The whole journey takes less than 30 interest, which is still due to the cost of waiting, otherwise, it will be faster.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun was excited and went back to her yard directly. Soon, the fragrance came out. When the day was light, the chicken had been completely stuffed into Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s stomach.</p>
<p>Only chicken feathers and bones are left</p>
<p>After eating this Lingwei chicken, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s hunger suddenly dissipated, and his body was obviously replenished. His whole body was warm, which made him feel very comfortable.</p>
<p>Even the aura in her body was a little bit more, but the most obvious one was the immortal longevity work, which made Bai Xiaochun move seven or eight breathing cycles in one breath.</p>
<p>Every breath, his body will have bursts of warm diffuse, condensed on the skin, making his skin look more tough, although there is a black flash, you can look carefully, it is still white and pure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This immortal longevity work, first pain, then hunger. It is really difficult to practice, but the effect is very good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Bai Xiaochun raised his right hand, he took out his wooden sword and gently touched it on the back of his hand.</p>
<p>When he touched Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s skin, Bai Xiaochun obviously felt some resistance. He didn&rsquo;t continue, but he was more determined to practice immortal longevity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;According to the immortal longevity work, the immortality skin is divided into four levels: gold, silver, copper and iron. I should be just a beginner now. If I can breathe for ninety-one days We can achieve the small success of immortal iron Bai Xiaochun looked at the chicken bone beside his eyes, and knew the way to cultivate the immortal iron sheet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fortunately, there are enough Lingwei chickens on the mountain.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun laughs and is more interested in Lingwei chicken.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t know that the immortal longevity skill had been practiced by many people in Lingxi sect for thousands of years. Most of them gave up because they could not bear the terrible torture in the first 81 days, but some of them persisted. However, the focus of practice after this skill was the consumption of resources.</p>
<p>If you want to cultivate immortality gold skin, the cost is extremely terrible. Even a sect will not pay it easily. After all, the same resources to practice other methods of body building are more cost-effective.</p>
<p>It is also for this reason that the immortal longevity work is placed in the Sutra Pavilion, and no one is interested in it.</p>
<p>After practicing, Bai Xiaochun arranged the chicken bones and buried them in the spirit soil. As for the chicken feathers, he also threw them down.</p>
<p>After that, he went out of the courtyard and went to the place where there were many disciples of the outer gate. He raised his ears and inquired about the information. Based on his experience in the village, he knew that the time of chicken stealing needed to be improved every three to five times.</p>
<p>After some inquiry, I didn&rsquo;t hear about the loss of Lingwei chicken, but I happened to know that the tricolor tail of Lingwei chicken was actually the fuel of tricolor fire.</p>
<p>After knowing this, Bai Xiaochun immediately ran back to the yard and dug out the tricolor tail from the holy soil. She took it in her hand and looked at it for a long time. Her eyes showed deep meditation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No wonder this chicken will be raised in large quantities.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun quickly put the tricolor feather in the storage bag. For others, it is just a pure three color fire fuel, but for him, it represents three times of soul refining.</p>
<p>Not immediately to use, he planned to have the elixir, and then to refine the spirit, so that the effect of the elixir is stronger.</p>
<p>A few days later, Bai Xiaochun, who had stopped for a few days, began to be hungry again. In the middle of the night, he put down the jade slips in the second chapter of vegetation and slipped out again in the dark. When he came back, there were already two Lingwei chickens in the storage bag.</p>
<p>In this way, time slowly passed, and a month passed in a twinkling of an eye. In the past month, the whole Xiangyun mountain began to spread the loss of Lingwei chicken.</p>
<p>Even Li Qinghou knew about it. After all, in this month, there were more than dozens of Lingwei chickens lost in three places where Lingwei chickens were kept. However, he didn&rsquo;t pay too much attention to it. He didn&rsquo;t pay attention to it because he had to go out.</p>
<p>The most depressing ones are those outside disciples who are responsible for raising Lingwei chicken. These seven or eight people are not in love with chickens. After all, they are not their own, and the palm seat has not said anything. They feel that they have no face. They dare to steal chicken in front of themselves. For the chicken stealer, they have already gnawed their teeth.</p>
<p>But there is no way, no matter how they protect them, the chicken is still constantly lost. What makes them puzzled is that every time they lose it, there is no sound at all, as if the chicken is gone out of thin air.</p>
<p>However, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s body has completely recovered to normal in the past month, and even gained a little weight. No matter how he absorbs the immortal longevity work, he has a lot of chicken to supplement. His face is red and he is back to his daily life.</p>
<p>When he was in a good mood and his stomach was not hungry, his speed of studying the second chapter of plants and trees was also improved a lot. Finally, on this day, he thoroughly studied the second chapter of plants and plants. Especially after the experience of the last time, he was more comprehensive this time. Not only the leaves and stems, roots and veins, but also the villi were ripe in the chest, he was more confident that even if it was divided into dozens of pieces, he could have a glance Recognize.</p>
<p>This just held up his head and walked out of the yard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This time, I want to let everyone know that I am the turtle on top of Zhou Xinqi!&rdquo; With expectation, Bai Xiaochun goes straight to Wanyao Pavilion.</p>
<p>[it&rsquo;s about to be 515 soon. I hope it can continue to impact the 515 red envelope list. On May 15, the red envelope rain will give back to readers and publicity works. A piece is also love, must be better! ]</p>
