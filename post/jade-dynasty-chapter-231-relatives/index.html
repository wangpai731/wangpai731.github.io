      <p>I don&rsquo;t know how long I&rsquo;ve been sleeping, but I feel the familiar smell all around me. I don&rsquo;t know how long I haven&rsquo;t felt this kind of peace of mind.</p>
<p>Therefore, I also fell into a deep dream, as if I didn&rsquo;t want to wake up. But in the deep of the dream, there was always a tingling feeling, which lingered around and refused to disperse, and constantly pierced my heart.</p>
<p>With a breath, he woke up. He looked at the room in front of him like a dream. When he was a boy, he lived here and grew up. Almost all the tables, chairs, beds, doors and windows were engraved in his heart.</p>
<p>On the wall of the bed, the huge word &ldquo;Dao&rdquo; is still hanging on the wall, but the color and handwriting are a little faded, but the strokes and paintings are still as vigorous and powerful as they were when they first met.</p>
<p>The wooden frame on the window made a light noise and opened a gap. Xiaohui, a grey haired monkey, jumped in from the outside. Seeing that Gui Li had already woken up and sat half on the bed, he couldn&rsquo;t help being happy. He grinned and jumped onto the bed a few times.</p>
<p>There was a flutter in his heart, which seemed to be the same as it had been many years ago. If it was not for his own injuries and the spiritual eyes opened on his small gray head, he really had the illusion of Nanke&rsquo;s dream.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that, after all, it&rsquo;s impossible.</p>
<p>Small ash to the ghost &ldquo;squeak squeak&rdquo; to call. GUI Li looked down and saw Xiao Hui holding several wild fruits in his hands. He thought he had picked them from the outside. At the moment, he seemed to want to share them with his master. Ghost Li shook his head and said he didn&rsquo;t want to eat. Small ash also does not let much, then turn around to shout ground once again jump to the table in the middle of the house, squat down, and then open mouth big chew up.</p>
<p>He looked at everything in the room silently, and finally his eyes fell on the half opened window when Xiao Hui came in. From the window came a small piece of light, can not see things outside. But GUI Li didn&rsquo;t have to look at it and knew that outside the window was a small courtyard, where there was a pine tree and a green lawn. There was also a stone path, and on one side of the courtyard, there was a semicircular arch. All the plants and trees here have been engraved in his memory. No more.</p>
<p>The air was so fresh and sweet that even the little courtyard outside seemed to have the fragrance of grass.</p>
<p>In a trance, he felt like going home, but after a moment. A stab in the bottom of my heart awakened him.</p>
<p>Outside the door, there was the sound of footsteps.</p>
<p>His fierce eyes turned to the door. The footstep sound soon arrived at the door, but in front of the open door, the person outside seemed hesitant for a moment, and did not open the door immediately.</p>
<p>Stare at the door.</p>
<p>A moment later, the door was finally pushed open.</p>
<p>A tall and steady figure stood at the door, almost at the same time. The man also saw the wake-up. Their eyes met in midair, but neither of them spoke at once. In their eyes, there are too many complex emotions, I do not know whether it is because of this that the original thousands of words are turned into silence.</p>
<p>Monkey small ash sat on the table, spit out a wild fruit stone, and then looked at the door, &ldquo;squeak&rdquo; called a few times, and then buried his head to eat its wild fruit.</p>
<p>The man standing at the door sighed. The corner of his mouth seemed to show a bitter smile, shook his head, walked in and took a deep look at the ghost. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen you for so many years. Should I call you old seven or younger martial brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At last, he looked at the man in front of him and called out in a low voice</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elder martial brother&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everything on the big bamboo peak. Still as quiet as memory, a quiet, I do not know where other people have gone.</p>
<p>Song Daren looks at the man in front of him in silence. Once upon a time, he was his favorite little younger martial brother, and the seven students who were the least successful under the teacher&rsquo;s seat of Dazhu Fengtian. But now, time is changing, things are different, things are different.</p>
<p>Ten years ago, this is the first time we met.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How have you been these years?&rdquo; Song Daren is sitting opposite to the fierce + and asks.</p>
<p>GUI Li didn&rsquo;t answer. He was just silent. Ten years, looking back on time, such as water, unconsciously has gone through this long road, but, but how to say a &ldquo;good&rdquo; word!</p>
<p>Song Daren looks at him. Zhang Xiaofan, who was once a teenager, still has the original outline. However, there is still a lot of vicissitudes on his face. However, he is much younger than himself, but now his Taoism is much higher than himself. However, his sideburns have already seen gray hair.</p>
<p>Song Daren uttered a long sigh and said, &ldquo;how are you now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li looked down at the wound. He saw that the original rags on his chest had been changed into neat and clean bandages. It was obviously that these elder martial brothers of dazhufeng had repainted them for themselves.</p>
<p>The wound between the chest was obviously still slightly painful, but it was much better than before fainting. He was silent for a moment and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ok. Thank you for your concern.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Speaking of this, he seemed to suddenly think of something, looked at Song Daren and said, &ldquo;I You still recognize me as a younger martial brother</p>
<p>Song Daren smiles. Although the smile is bitter and astringent, he says, &ldquo;Shiniang has told us that Shifu was in his old age&hellip;&rdquo; Speaking of the two words before his death, song Daren&rsquo;s eyes were red and his voice was obviously choked up. He listened in his ears, and his body trembled slightly.</p>
<p>Song Daren calmed down and continued: &ldquo;master, he told his mother many times before he died that he never drove you out of dazhufeng, and he never thought about what you had done ten years ago. So the teacher&rsquo;s wife told us that if you still want to, you will still be the seventh of Dazhu peak in Qingyun Mountain Younger martial brother&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>GUI Li slowly lowered his head, and his body trembled slightly. His left hand was placed on the mattress and tightly grasped into a ball. His right hand covered his face and quietly wiped away the tears from the corners of his eyes.</p>
<p>There was a moment of silence in the room. After a long time, song Daren&rsquo;s deep voice began to ring again when he saw that the ghost&rsquo;s mood gradually calmed down</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t have any physical problems, you can follow me to Shoujing hall, where Shiniang is the master Wake, she wants to see you</p>
<p>“…… Yes</p>
<p>Out of the arch, you can see the familiar circular corridor. Song Daren walks in front of him without saying a word. His broad shoulders and back look like a hill.</p>
<p>He followed him in silence. I can&rsquo;t help but think of when I was a teenager. When I first came to dazhufeng, I followed song Daren all the way and slowly integrated into the world of dazhufeng.</p>
<p>Looking back. Suddenly like a dream.</p>
<p>His eyes, quietly fell on Song Daren&rsquo;s waist, this just found that, do not know when, song Daren&rsquo;s waist has been more than a white cloth. Naturally, it was for the sake of his teacher Tian&rsquo;s death that he felt filial piety.</p>
<p>He turned pale and closed his eyes.</p>
<p>After walking out of the corridor, I saw the Shoujing hall from a distance. However, it was quite different from that in Pingyue. However, there was smoke and incense coming out of the Shoujing hall today, and there was a faint choking cry.</p>
<p>Song Daren quietly walked toward the Shoujing hall. After two steps, he suddenly realized that he looked back.</p>
<p>But I found that Gui Li Zheng Zheng stood in the same place, looking at Shoujing hall, but did not step forward to keep up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li&rsquo;s face looked very pale. Somehow, he looked at the shoujingtang where the smoke and fire were blowing and crying. He felt a bit afraid in his heart. He was like a child who had done something wrong and didn&rsquo;t dare to face the parents who were going to be sad.</p>
<p>Song Daren seemed to see something, sighed and said, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo; Said. He reached out and patted him on the shoulder. GUI Li&rsquo;s body moved, took a look at Song Daren, nodded silently, and stepped up.</p>
<p>The closer we get to Shoujing hall. The stronger the smell of fireworks, the clearer the voice of choking and crying. However, although there are familiar sounds in ghost memory, there is no woman&rsquo;s cry, no Su Ru&rsquo;s, and no elder martial sister Tian ling&rsquo;er, who has been married as a woman, as he had expected.</p>
<p>Finally. Under the leadership of song Daren, he once again stood at the entrance of the gate of Shoujing hall.</p>
<p>Eight eyes line of sight, instantly turned around, stopped on his body. His body trembled faintly. His eyes looked at the past one by one.</p>
<p>Wu Dayi, Zheng Dali, he Dazhi, LV Daxin, Du Bishu!</p>
<p>These familiar faces are all in front of him one by one. Many years ago, they were his most intimate relatives and most reliable senior brother in the world.</p>
<p>Their waists are like song Daren, tied with white cloth of filial piety, their faces are sad, some eyes have been red and swollen. In the Shoujing hall, there is a big iron pot burning with fire. The elder martial brothers standing beside them slowly put the paper money in their hands into the fire.</p>
<p>There were fireworks and smoke.</p>
<p>After the smoke, Tian Bu Yi lies quietly on a spiritual bed. His dirty clothes have been changed into a clean and tidy one. It seems that his appearance and spirit are more peaceful. Su Ru, the teacher&rsquo;s mother, is sitting beside Tian Buyi&rsquo;s body, holding out his hand and holding it tightly.</p>
<p>Her expression is very sad, but she did not shed a drop of tears, in her temples, inserted a small white flower, it is also in the morning dew of wild flowers, elegant and beautiful, with a bit of sadness. She just held her husband&rsquo;s hand tightly and gazed at Tian Buyi&rsquo;s face. His daughter Tian ling&rsquo;er, however, did not appear in the hall.</p>
<p>But the rhubarb, which was not easily raised by the field since childhood, was lying on the ground beside the burial bed, and his head was listlessly lying on the ground, completely losing the temperament of jumping off.</p>
<p>Ghostly eyes fell on the field is not easy after the body, can not move again. He walked slowly, step by step. In silence, song Daren went to the side, took a piece of hemp rope and handed it to Gui Li. GUI Li looked at him, a trace of gratitude passed in his eyes, nodded, took the hemp rope, and whispered: &ldquo;thank you very much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren took a look at Su Ru and said, &ldquo;you go over there.&rdquo; After that, he went back to his classmates in silence, knelt down to Tian Buyi&rsquo;s body and knocked his head three times. When his head was raised, his eyes were a little red. He turned around and took a stack of paper money from Wu Dayi, who was kneeling beside him, and began to slowly throw it into the fire.</p>
<p>GUI Li looked at the hemp rope in his hand for a long time, and then tied the rope to his waist. The gray rope twined around his waist, with a few sorrows, but it seemed that his heart was bound here again.</p>
<p>He walked forward in silence, went to the bed, knelt down, bowed to Tian Bu Yi&rsquo;s body for three times, then turned to Su Ru and knelt down on the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Disciple&hellip;&rdquo; His voice suddenly stopped for a long time. Then he heard him speak again in a low voice: &ldquo;disciple Zhang Xiao Fan, I&rsquo;ll see you. &quot;</p>
<p>Behind him, six disciples of dazhufeng, including song Daren, looked here. Facial expressions are some complex, but more, still that kind of blood thicker than water joy and kindness.</p>
<p>Even on Su Ru&rsquo;s face, she also showed a touch of relief. She looked at the ghost. He nodded, followed by a trace of pain on the back. He looked at the field and said in a low voice, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not easy. Do you hear that? This is Lao Qi. He came back to kowtow to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li knelt down at Su Ru&rsquo;s feet, unable to speak.</p>
<p>Behind him came a choking voice.</p>
<p>The smoke was swirling and drifting slowly. Shoujing hall became a little trance, I don&rsquo;t know if it is because the master is not there. Even the hall of this work looks empty, and it doesn&rsquo;t become noisy because of the large number of people.</p>
<p>After a long time, song Daren wiped away his tears from the corner of his eyes, came up to Su Ru and said in a low voice, &ldquo;Shiniang, please tell me what happened to Master Shifu. You should inform the teachers and seniors of all the veins one by one.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also going to go to longshoufeng to inform younger martial sister linger and ask her to&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not urgent.&rdquo; Su Ru abruptly interrupts song Daren&rsquo;s words, light tunnel.</p>
<p>Song Daren is surprised by the disciples behind him. Including GUI Li, they were all stunned for a moment. In the Shoujing hall, there was no sound at all.</p>
<p>After a long time, song Daren was bold. Carefully said: &ldquo;Shiniang, after the death of Shifu, the disciples all understand that the teacher&rsquo;s sad, but this is what happened But it can&rsquo;t be delayed. &quot;</p>
<p>Su Ru&rsquo;s face did not change. Not only that, she didn&rsquo;t even look at Song Daren. In her eyes, in addition to looking at the old seven who had just returned, there was only Tian Bu Yi&rsquo;s figure.</p>
<p>Song Daren looks embarrassed. For a moment, he doesn&rsquo;t know what to do. He looks back at the younger martial brothers who are kneeling on the ground burning paper money. However, they are all looking at each other and don&rsquo;t know what to do? At this moment, Su Ru called out</p>
<p>&ldquo;Da Ren.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren said in a hurry: &ldquo;yes, Shiniang, what can I do for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru said: &ldquo;you and other people go out temporarily, do not come in without my exchange.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren stayed for a while and stepped back a few steps. His younger martial brothers all looked at him. Song Daren frowned and said that he Dazhi, the most clever one, shook his head slightly at him. His face was anxious. Song Daren looked at him, but his brow was just tighter.</p>
<p>He had been with these younger martial brothers for a long time. He understood what he was worried about. He is the one who followed Tian Buyi and Su Ru for the longest time among these disciples. No one knows better than him the deep love between the master and his wife. If Shiniang can&rsquo;t get over it when they are away, isn&rsquo;t it</p>
<p>With this in mind, song Daren&rsquo;s face was white with fright, and he couldn&rsquo;t move any more. At this time, Su Ru glared at them and said in a slight anger, &ldquo;what are you doing? Are you not paying attention to the words of my teacher mother when your master dies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plop! Plop</p>
<p>Several times in a row, in addition to the original kneeling in front of Su Ru, song Daren and other disciples of dazhufeng all knelt down and kowtowed. Song Daren repeatedly said: &ldquo;I dare not, I dare not!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru sighed, and her face showed a deep weariness. She seemed to have no strength to swear. She just waved her hand and said, &ldquo;you go out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren and others did not dare to disobey the teacher&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s meaning. They all retreated with bitter faces, but the big stone in their hearts was heavy, and they didn&rsquo;t know what to do. GUI Li gently worships Su Ru and slowly retreats. But he just steps back. Su Ru suddenly says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seven, you stay, I have something to ask you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was stunned and stopped, but song Daren and others were relieved. No matter what, as long as someone was around the teacher&rsquo;s wife, there would be no accident. At the moment, only the sound of footsteps was heard. Soon, song Daren and other six people had already left the Shoujing hall.</p>
<p>Shoujing hall, for a moment quiet down, only the burning flame devouring paper money, from time to time issued a slight crackling sound.</p>
<p>GUI Li stood in silence. He looked down and didn&rsquo;t know how long it took. He only heard Su Ru sigh and said, &ldquo;your master, you are always hard spoken and soft hearted. Ten years ago, he was still very worried about the incident. Although he didn&rsquo;t speak to me, I can see that he felt a little sorry for you in his heart</p>
<p>A red eye. Shaking his head hard, he said in a hurry: &ldquo;no, it&rsquo;s the disciple who is unworthy and has failed his teacher&rsquo;s kindness. It&rsquo;s the disciple who is sorry for the master&hellip; &quot; After that, he was choked.</p>
<p>Su Ru&rsquo;s mouth trembled slightly, and she heard the voice of crying in front of her. It seemed that she was also touched by heartache, but her eyes were hurt. But after all, I tried to hold back and didn&rsquo;t cry. She looked at Tian Bu Yi&rsquo;s face in silence and said, &ldquo;in your master&rsquo;s heart, you never thought you were a disciple who drove out the door and wall. Do you understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said in a low voice</p>
<p>Su Ru said: &ldquo;now that you have recognized him as a master, you can go over and burn him some paper money. I think it&rsquo;s not easy for him to be happy&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost sharp teeth close bite, toward the field not easy body kneel down. He said goodbye three times, tears in his eyes, and then he got up and went to the pot and knelt down. The flame in the iron pot has been much lower, presumably because song Daren and others have gone out, and no one has added paper money. GUI Li took a look at the side and saw that there were several stacks of thick paper money not far away, all of which were new products without Kaifeng.</p>
<p>All the people on Dazhu peak are monks. I&rsquo;m afraid they can&rsquo;t use paper money for hundreds of years. These things must have been bought by song Daren on a temporary basis. Think of it here.</p>
<p>Ghost in the heart is a acid, silently reached out to take a stack, untied the seal, the paper money one by one into ashes.</p>
<p>Su Ru sits beside Tian Buyi. Silently looking at the ups and downs, rolling flames, the fire reflected in the iron pot next to the face of the ghost, reflecting the light flickering.</p>
<p>She suddenly asked, &ldquo;when your master died, were you by his side?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Guili body slightly shocked, then turned the body, still kneeling next to the iron pot, at the same time facing Su Ru. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he whispered</p>
<p>Su Ru looked at the ghost and said, &ldquo;yesterday, after you fainted, I treated and changed the dressing for you. But I found that there was a unique red flame sword Qi in your body, which hurt your meridians the most. What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His heart leaped suddenly, and he felt a little sweat in his hands. After a moment, he said in a low voice: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s really the master&rsquo;s heavy hand that the disciple was injured this time, but&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he said this, he was at a loss for a moment, but he didn&rsquo;t know where to start. That night, the sudden change was sudden and the twists and turns were strange. Rao, who had experienced the world&rsquo;s disputes and turmoil for a long time, could not help but be shocked by it. What&rsquo;s more, the death of his most respected teacher in his life was more difficult to describe.</p>
<p>Su Ru snorted, and the Phoenix eyes were awe inspiring and said coldly, &ldquo;you come from the real way for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li didn&rsquo;t dare to look at Su Ru for a moment and lowered his head. After a while, he talked about it slowly. He came back to the ruins of Caomiao village and ran into a mysterious figure. He chased him all the way to the abandoned villa outside Heyang City, until Tian was not easy to die. He told Su Ru slowly.</p>
<p>Su Ru&rsquo;s face became paler and paler, especially after hearing the last part of Tian Buyi&rsquo;s death. She only grasped Tian Buyi&rsquo;s palm tightly with one hand, as if afraid of her husband&rsquo;s leaving again.</p>
<p>At last, he said in a low voice: &ldquo;this is what happened. I dare not deceive my teacher.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru&rsquo;s eyes moved to Tian. She looked deeply at the familiar and peaceful face. Perhaps, in her husband&rsquo;s heart, he didn&rsquo;t have much regret. In his heart, he thought that these were the things he should do!</p>
<p>She breathed deeply and straightened her body, although she really wanted to lie down like this and lie with her husband, no matter what, but she knew it was not time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You really see&hellip;&rdquo; Su Ru&rsquo;s voice sounds a bit erratic.</p>
<p>GUI Li didn&rsquo;t understand for a moment and said, &ldquo;teacher, what do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru looked pale and said in a low voice, &ldquo;that mysterious man is really a real master master Senior brother daoxuan? &quot;</p>
<p>GUI Li deeply breathed in air and resolutely said, &ldquo;if I see it with my own eyes, that person will turn into fly ash, and I will not mistake it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru nodded in silence. After a moment, she asked slowly, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not easy for him to say what you just said. When his mind was in disorder, he knocked you down. Was it Lu Xueqi of xiaozhufeng who killed him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ghost Li body big shock, a moment between the forehead of cold sweat, but in the end, he is still a bite of the teeth, said: &ldquo;yes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru didn&rsquo;t speak. She just stared at the ghost, as if in a trance. However, under her eyes, the expression on her ghostly face changed violently, like suffering. After a long time. Then he whispered, &ldquo;well Lu Xueqi, she is actually trying to save me. No, she is a disciple&hellip; &quot; Suddenly. With a look on his face, he knelt down on the ground and said in a low voice, &ldquo;Shiniang, thousands of mistakes are the fault of the disciples. Lu Xueqi, she&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru sighed. He said: &ldquo;I remember the disciple of Qingyun sect. Over the years, you and she are the best friends. Even if you enter the devil&rsquo;s road, I heard that she is still very worried about you. For your sake, she disobeyed elder martial sister Shuiyue&rsquo;s meaning several times, and even refused the proposal of master Yun Yi Lan of burning incense Valley, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li kneels down on the ground, his heart is in a mess, and there are thousands of words in his stomach. But I couldn&rsquo;t say a word. On the night of the great change, although he knew that Lu Xueqi had to do something to save him, Tian Buyi was the teacher who raised him and loved him all his life. In front of him, that Tianya sword was born and passed through his chest After that, he almost subconsciously refused Lu Xueqi thousands of miles away when he was deeply distressed.</p>
<p>After the turmoil in southern Xinjiang, there was a brief embrace. However, under this fate, the gap is deeper and bigger. I really don&rsquo;t know why heaven is so cruel!</p>
<p>This time in front of Su Ru, although the ghost has had such a complex mentality. But can&rsquo;t sit back and watch Su Ru misunderstand Lu Xueqi. However, he deeply understood that the teacher&rsquo;s mother was more affectionate towards her than her own. How could she ask her to be magnanimous when she was hard to accept?</p>
<p>He was speechless and did not know what to say.</p>
<p>The facts are sharp and merciless.</p>
<p>Everyone who is close to us seems to be hurt by it!</p>
<p>But at the moment, Su Ru&rsquo;s face was not as resolute as she imagined. On the contrary, after the initial sadness, her face slowly had the color of thinking. A moment later, Su Ru said sharply to the ghost: &ldquo;I remember you said just now that before you died, your mind had a short reply and recognized you, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He nodded and said, &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru said, &ldquo;what did he say to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>After thinking for a moment, he said in a low voice, &ldquo;master, after waking up, said two words to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru asked, &ldquo;what did he say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li said: &ldquo;the first sentence of master is strange, but he repeatedly says three words: don&rsquo;t blame her, don&rsquo;t blame her. The second sentence is to explain to the disciple that after the death of the master, he will take his old man&rsquo;s body back to Dazhu peak and give it to Shiniang, and then tell her that&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>Su Ru changed her face and said, &ldquo;what does he want you to say to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li said in a low voice: &ldquo;when the master was dying, he asked his disciples to tell her that she would be sad. Don&rsquo;t Don&rsquo;t do anything stupid. &quot;</p>
<p>Su Ru was stunned and speechless. Her eyes were filled with tears, and she was shaking and shaking again and again. Her whole body was weak, and she was in a state of heartbreak. Ghost Li heart pain and worry, but dare not go forward, can only kneel down on the ground, kowtow: &ldquo;Shiniang mourning!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a long time, only to hear Su Ru slightly calm down the voice, low way: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ok, you get up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li stood up and looked up. Su Ru&rsquo;s face was calm, but the sad color in her eyes was still obvious.</p>
<p>In the Shoujing hall, there is silence again. The ghost adds some paper money to the iron pot nearby. At this time, Su Ru suddenly says, &ldquo;are you dissatisfied and resentful to Lu Xueqi for killing your master?&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li was surprised. I didn&rsquo;t know what the meaning of this sentence was. I couldn&rsquo;t answer it for a moment. But Su Ru is a very clever person, plus the world has already seen through, only look at the look on the face of the ghost, it has been more than half clear.</p>
<p>She said faintly, &ldquo;do you know what it means to say&rdquo; don&rsquo;t blame her &ldquo;to you before you die</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; he said</p>
<p>Su Ru said with a wry smile, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s good as I expected. I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s not easy. He is willing to ask Lu Xueqi to kill him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li was surprised and said, &ldquo;teacher Niang, you said this&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru sighed and said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s it. The past can&rsquo;t be recalled, but it can&rsquo;t be dispersed. The secrets of our previous generation can&rsquo;t be implicated in you. &quot; She looked back silently and looked at Tian Buyi. She saw Tian Buyi&rsquo;s face peaceful and peaceful. She looked like he was asleep. She said in a low voice, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not easy. You must want me to tell him the secret&hellip;&rdquo; (to be continued. )</p>
