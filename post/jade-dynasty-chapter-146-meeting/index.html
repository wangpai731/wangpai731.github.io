      <p>There was no sound, only the sound of branches bursting from time to time in the fire. The strange boy and the ghost didn&rsquo;t speak any more. The flame was stretching and burning between them.</p>
<p>The surface color of the roast pig gradually turned into gold, and a slight burning smell appeared in the rich aroma. At this time, the surface of the whole roast pig was covered with a transparent layer of light oil drops. At last, the roast pig was turned several times and said, &ldquo;yes, you can eat it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as the words fell, Xiaohui and Taotie jumped up at the same time. Xiaohui &ldquo;squeaked&rdquo; and grabbed one of the hind legs of the roasted pig. It seemed that the pig skin, which was roasting hot, did not feel at all in its hands. However, the gluttonous food was even more powerful. He did not move his hands, feet and claws, but opened his mouth directly. Regardless of the fact that the pork was still on the fire, he directly put his head in and bit it off.</p>
<p>Taotie&rsquo;s mouth, which was originally a huge mouth, became more and more frightening. Such a large roast pig was bitten by the monster, leaving only one hind leg caught by Xiaohui and left outside.</p>
<p>Xiaohui was furious, and the monkey&rsquo;s face showed an angry expression. Holding pig&rsquo;s leg in his hand, he jumped and yelled at the same time. However, the gluttonous beast did not care about so many. His sharp teeth &ldquo;cracked&rdquo; and immediately bit the delicious pork into two sections. Xiaohui was caught off guard. He fell backward with too much force for a moment and rolled twice under the ground. When he stood up, he only grasped one It&rsquo;s a pig leg.</p>
<p>As for the vast majority of the delicious roast pig, it seems that the pig bone is directly bitten into the stomach by the gluttonous eater. It seems that the pig bone is directly crushed and swallowed into the stomach, and the food is like the wind and the remnant clouds. In particular, the four eyes on the face are squeezed to the two sides of the face by the bulging mouth, and they still shine. It is obvious that the pig bone is very enjoyable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cheep, cheep&hellip;&rdquo; Xiaohui saw that the delicious food originally belonged to him was robbed by the evil beast. How could he not be angry? But after a few shouts, he bowed his head fiercely and gnawed. It also eats very fast, but after a while a pig leg ate most of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roar&hellip;&rdquo; Gluttonous low roar again rang up, slowly turned his head to look at small ash, so big a roast pig. In this short time, he ate it clean and swallowed it directly without any bones left. And it is obvious that gluttonous food is still in its infancy, and its four eyes are shining. Staring at the last bone in Xiao Hui&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>Xiao Hui ate the last piece of meat fiercely. His three eyes widened together and looked at Taotie.</p>
<p>With his mouth full of salivation and salivation, Taotie came to Xiaohui step by step. Xiaohui waved fiercely, and the remaining bones in his hand were thrown far away in another direction. At the same time, the expression of schadenfreude appeared on his face. Unexpectedly, Taotie&rsquo;s figure flashed, such as electricity, light, even in the blink of an eye to catch up with the flying flesh and bones. A bite it, in the air a turning point, and fly back, landed on the youth side. But at this time, Taotie seemed to know that this was the last thing. He didn&rsquo;t swallow it. Instead, he was very fond of it. He put out his tongue and licked on the meat bone.</p>
<p>Xiaohui was frightened by the appearance of Taotie. After a moment, he turned to the ghost and suddenly danced and squeaked in his mouth. He looked at it for a while, then suddenly his face moved and said, &ldquo;do you say it looks like rhubarb?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Hui immediately nods and looks at Taotie. The anger on the monkey&rsquo;s face faded away, replaced by a strange and warm look. It looked at Taotie, who was licking the flesh bone for a while, then carefully moved over and slowly reached out his hand. It seemed that he wanted to feel the ferocious head of Taotie. Taotie&rsquo;s ferocious head turned and growled in a low alert voice. Xiao Hui immediately jumps back, but then squeaks twice and gets close to Taotie again, and Taotie&rsquo;s attention seems to be temporarily away from the meat bones and put on Xiaohui.</p>
<p>A moment later, Xiaohui&rsquo;s hand extended again. Taotie didn&rsquo;t move, but his four eyes looked at Xiaohui&rsquo;s hand, while GUI Li and the boy kept silent, especially the young man&rsquo;s eyes had a strange light, silently watching the communication between the two animals.</p>
<p>Xiaohui&rsquo;s hand touched Taotie&rsquo;s head and touched it gently. Taotie&rsquo;s mouth growled twice, but there was no objection. His attention returned to the meat bone in front of him. Xiaohui then slowly approached the strange animal and stroked Taotie&rsquo;s body with his hand. The monkey&rsquo;s face showed a happy look.</p>
<p>GUI Li slowly lowered his head, vaguely remembering that many years ago, Xiaohui and rhubarb seemed to be so close to each other. Time is like water, the original small ash still remember the original</p>
<p>The young man suddenly broke the silence and said with a smile: &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine that they are very predestined, are they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li looked at Xiaohui and Taotie with a look, and there was also a trace of warmth in his eyes, and said: &ldquo;not bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy turned his head and added a twig to the fire. After a long time, he suddenly said with a smile: &ldquo;this glutton has been following me for many years. I always thought that I was taking care of it. I didn&rsquo;t expect to find out today that it was much happier than me.&rdquo; The smile on his face seemed to have a hint of bitterness. He said, &ldquo;in addition to eating and drinking enough, even if it&rsquo;s not the same kind, you monkey is willing to make friends with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li raised his eyes and looked at the young man. He looked bleak, as if there was a sense of loneliness that could not be said. He said faintly, &ldquo;if you are lonely, you can go to find a friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man snorted, arrogantly said: &ldquo;this world is big, who deserves to be my friend, and who dares to be my friend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost&rsquo;s eyebrows wrinkled. The boy&rsquo;s voice was so exaggerated that he was disgusted. However, he saw that the boy seemed to think of something. His face was gloomy, and he whispered to himself, &ldquo;but there is a man who I really believe in&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at him through the burning flame in front of him and said calmly: &ldquo;how?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man&rsquo;s face was suddenly cold and sneered: &ldquo;later, I found out that she was cheating me. Not only that, she also hurt me. It was so terrible that I was almost doomed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the young man&rsquo;s look, he suddenly recalled the past ten years ago. The face of the kind monk seemed to appear in front of his eyes</p>
<p>Suddenly, he shook his head violently, but with great strength in his hands, the branches that were being added to the fire made a slight hoarse noise, which turned into powder and scattered all over the ground.</p>
<p>The boy took a look at his hand and suddenly said, &ldquo;do you have such sad past?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy looked at him, his eyes glistening. Suddenly he said, &ldquo;if you are going to die now, is there anything you wish for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was stunned and lost in his mind. This problem, which he had never thought of, suddenly appeared in front of him. He had deep hatred, great hatred, ten-year wish, and lingering white clothes. But never thought of their deep heart, what is the final wish?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to save Biyao. If you can save her, I&rsquo;ll be content to die! He had thought about this idea many times and times in his mind in the countless nights of ten years. But there is the frost face, after all, can not give up, in the heart of the secluded corner, gently floating</p>
<p>He was crazy for a moment. The night wind was bleak, and he didn&rsquo;t know how much time had passed.</p>
<p>By the time he woke up, the boy had disappeared, and the glutton on the ground seemed to have just soared into the sky, blending into the darkness, and its deep roar came from afar.</p>
<p>Xiao Hui ran up to his shoulder and squeaked twice. He looked up at the sky slowly. Suddenly, he said in a low voice: &ldquo;Xiaohui, I always want to see her, right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Hui doesn&rsquo;t seem to understand. Also lazy to pay attention to, monkey head also looked at the sky, seems to be looking for the figure of Taotie.</p>
<p>The embers of the gradually extinguished fire gradually turned into a wisp of smoke. Light floating, ghost and small ash stand in the deep mountain forest, for a long time, in the night wind, there is only a faint low voice.</p>
<p>“…… Always want to see her&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>With the passage of time, the situation has become more and more tragic. Monsters have been killed in the Middle Earth, and the common people have suffered heavy casualties. Most of the disciples of the righteous sect who went out to investigate disappeared. When a few of the disciples with a higher level of Taoism came back, they were all decorated with colors. When they reported to the upright teachers, they said that the monsters were terrible.</p>
<p>At this time, it was announced that Qingyun gate, Tianyin temple, and Fenxiang Valley, the three orthodox sects, would unite with Qingyun Mountain and invite them to deal with the catastrophe. All of them gathered in Qingyun Mountain one after another. In just a few days, thousands of people have gathered around Qingyun Mountain, most of them are Chinese people who have fled. In their eyes, these immortal monks are their last hope.</p>
<p>The Qingyun gate, which is in charge of reception, is busy. More and more Taoist friends and people come to Qingyun. Soon, the guest rooms on the Qingyun gate to Tianfeng are not enough, so we have to let other channels open their rooms. Fortunately, Qingyun gate, after all, is a millennium school with deep roots and great career. In the end, it still accepted it. However, xiaozhufeng, one of the seven veins, was not open to the outside world because it was always a female disciple and master Shuiyue had a strange temperament, which made many young foreign school students who had long admired him feel sorry.</p>
<p>However, in spite of the current catastrophe, this is still an unprecedented gathering of righteousness. The Qingyun gate is respectful to the landlord, and its reputation has increased even more than before. It seems that the world has taken Qingyun as its leader, and daoxuan, the leader of Qingyun sect, is now the first person in the world.</p>
<p>At night, all the peaks in Qingyun Mountain range are full of lights, which is a grand event that has never been seen in thousands of years. Far below the mountain, with the wind blowing, it seems that people on the mountain can also hear people talking and laughing. People who are afraid of the catastrophe seem to be in a much lighter mood under such circumstances. After all, even if the sky falls, isn&rsquo;t there a Qingyun Mountain on top of it?</p>
<p>At the moment, the quietest place on Qingyun Mountain is probably xiaozhufeng. After the good intentions of the Qingyun sect, all the sects strictly restrict their disciples and forbid them to approach xiaozhufeng. After all, if there is still a farce of climbing a traitor under the current situation, I&rsquo;m afraid that no one&rsquo;s face will look good.</p>
<p>Compared with the bustle of other peaks, Xiaozhu peak is much more quiet. Occasionally, two or three beautiful female disciples of xiaozhufeng pass by on the mountain road. The mountain breeze blows, and the tears and bamboos all over the mountain shake together and make a rustling sound.</p>
<p>This night, the moon was cold, shining on the xiaozhufeng mountain road, the bamboo shadow was whirling, and the shadow was swinging on the steps of the mountain path. In the distance came four or five female disciples of xiaozhufeng. The first one was Wen min. The female disciples, including Wen Min, looked gloomy and frowned, as if they were worried.</p>
<p>The cold wind in the bamboo forest seemed to flash with dark shadows.</p>
<p>The youngest girl next to Wen Min is only about 13 years old. She is rather timid. She looks at the dark place and looks pale. She approaches Wen Min, grabs her dress and says in a low voice, &ldquo;senior sister, senior sister, there seems to be someone there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wen Min and the others were shocked. After a while, Wen Min&rsquo;s face showed a little smile, patted the little girl&rsquo;s face and said, &ldquo;little poem. It&rsquo;s the shadow of the bamboo swaying by the mountain wind. It&rsquo;s like this every night. You&rsquo;ve just been up the mountain, and you&rsquo;ll find out after a while. &quot;</p>
<p>The girl called the little poem was relieved. But there was still some fear. She just seemed to think of something. Suddenly, she looked back at the back mountain and said, &ldquo;elder martial sister, there is no one around the moon watching platform in the back mountain. There are all these gloomy things everywhere. If we leave elder martial sister Xueqi there alone, will she be afraid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wen Min&rsquo;s face was gloomy, sighed and said, &ldquo;it was the master&rsquo;s uncle who asked you to reflect on Xueqi there.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t help it, but sister Xueqi should not be afraid! &quot;</p>
<p>Another woman standing behind Wen Min suddenly snorted, with a strong sense of injustice, and said, &ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t understand why the headmaster should treat Xueqi like this because she won&rsquo;t agree to the promotion of Huoxiang Valley?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pa&rdquo;, deep in the bamboo forest, there seems to be a slight low sound, like some small animal trampling on the bamboo branch, but the women&rsquo;s attention has been attracted to the past. She did not hear the noise, only the youngest poem seemed to have some doubts, but she looked into the deep bamboo forest and saw the shadow shaking. Can not help but face is a white, hastily turn a head not to look.</p>
<p>Wen Min sighed and said, &ldquo;in fact, the Taoist brother Li Xun is not bad. He has a good appearance and good life experience. In the future, most of the positions of the master of the burning incense valley will be passed on to him. And look at his appearance, he is also very cherish snow Qi, but the word of love is not really able to force</p>
<p>Another woman suddenly complained in a low voice: &ldquo;master is really, knowing Xueqi&rsquo;s temper, how can&rsquo;t she help her to talk to the master?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman shook her head and said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s right. Xue Qi listened to her master&rsquo;s words most and respected her leader, master daoxuan. However, she openly contradicted them on the Tongtian peak. I think&hellip;&rdquo; She suddenly lowered her voice and said in a soft voice, &ldquo;has Xue Qi already had a lover in her heart&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo; Wen Min suddenly whispered a drink, and the people were surprised. Wen Min&rsquo;s face was slightly relaxed, but his tone was still very severe. He said in a low voice: &ldquo;we should never talk nonsense about this kind of speculation. Otherwise, if it is spread to the ears of the headmaster, master and master, we are afraid that the consequences will be unimaginable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everyone was silent. The woman standing behind Wen Min was silent for a moment and said in a low voice: &ldquo;elder martial sister, in fact, in my opinion, I&rsquo;m afraid we can think of what kind of people are the headmaster, the master and the master. How can we not think of them? This time, the headmaster and the master deliberately promised to propose a marriage to the burning incense Valley, just because they knew that Xue Qi had&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>Wen MINMENG turns his head and stares at her. The woman&rsquo;s face changes slightly, sighs and stops talking. Wen Min was silent for a moment when she sighed, but she couldn&rsquo;t help sighing: &ldquo;sister Lin, in fact, we are all in the same mood. Although Xue Qi and several of us started at different times, we have already been in love with each other for more than ten years. No one wants to see her change like this.</p>
<p>But Well, I don&rsquo;t know how to say it. Anyway, I think Shifu always loves Xueqi the most. After all, she won&rsquo;t be too embarrassed. &quot;</p>
<p>The other female disciples nodded together, and they walked slowly, talking in low voice, and sighing faintly, which gradually went far away.</p>
<p>The shadow of the bamboo grove swayed, and suddenly a dark shadow seemed to float out of the deep darkness and fall on the mountain road. It was just ghostly. In this place full of deadly enemies, his face was pale and silent for a long time, and then he slowly turned back to look at the back mountain of xiaozhufeng. Behind that bamboo forest, the moonlight is as clear as frost. It is said that it is the place of the moon watching platform of xiaozhufeng, which is the six sceneries of Qingyun.</p>
<p>Most of the cliffs hanging in the air are suspended in the air, except for the latter part which is connected with the mountain. This night, the moon is bright, hanging high in the sky, as clear as water, like frost and snow, falling on the earth, falling on the moon watching platform. Although it is not as bright as the legendary full moon night, which can light up the whole Xiaozhu peak, the moonlight on the moon watching platform is gentle, which makes the whole cliff as bright as day. Especially, the smooth rocks on the ground reflect countless moons due to different angles, which makes it particularly cool and beautiful.</p>
<p>When the ghost set foot on the moon watching platform, it was this beautiful scenery that appeared in front of him. In the frosty moonlight, there is a woman in white, who is facing him, standing on the platform in front of the cliff, overlooking the endless night in the distance, standing silently.</p>
<p>The fierce face was indifferent, but a pair of eyes seemed to be shining because of the reflection of the beautiful moonlight, the figure in white. Like a fairy standing in the moonlight, there is no earthly smell at all.</p>
<p>It seemed to feel something. The figure moved. Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s cold and slightly tired voice rang up: &ldquo;elder martial sister. Why are you back again&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>She slowly turned back and said, but in the middle of her speech, her voice suddenly disappeared. Lu Xueqi had always been indifferent and plain on her face. The figure of that man stood there silently, gazing at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zhang&hellip;&rdquo; She opened her mouth slightly, but her voice was low before she spoke Xiao Fan. &quot;</p>
<p>Standing still, the moon shone on Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s ice and snow skin, almost as transparent and flawless, which added to her breathtaking beauty. Far away. He had a feeling that he didn&rsquo;t dare to get close.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you ok?&rdquo; He has thousands of words in his stomach, but the words he says are only these.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi gazed at the man, the man standing at the junction of moonlight and shadow. The expression on his face was so complicated, as if something in his heart was torturing him, but the figure was clearly in front of him! In the dream, I don&rsquo;t know how many times I think of the figure!</p>
<p>She lowered her head a little and stopped. After a long time, he said softly, &ldquo;since you are here. Why don&rsquo;t you come here? &quot;</p>
<p>The ghost Li body shakes, at this moment originally has been following in his side the small ash also did not know where to go, saw in his eyes flash the color of hesitation, to him. It seems that a few short steps also need courage.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi is still standing there, so silent, the mountain wind blowing, her white dress gently fluttering.</p>
<p>Step out of the step, walk in the moonlight. Behind her, the bamboo grove rustled in the distance. The woman in front of her quietly looked up and stood in front of her.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi looked at him, and her initial excitement and panic disappeared. Suddenly she said, &ldquo;do you remember what I said? The next time we meet, we will be the enemy who will never agree with you.&rdquo; she looked at him and slowly said, &ldquo;why do you want to see me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The corner of her mouth moved, her eyes twinkled, and she suddenly moved away from her eyes. Just as Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s face gradually faded, the man in front of her slowly turned back, as if in hesitation, as if struggling, and finally gently said: &ldquo;you, as if you are thin&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s body was shocked, and her face was shocked again, but then came joy. For the first time in her life, a faint blush appeared on her white face, such as crystal clear ruby, with endless tenderness and lingering shyness.</p>
<p>Even if there is no tomorrow, even if the front is still dark, but if the heart is warm, maybe you won&rsquo;t be afraid</p>
<p>This beautiful and cold woman, suddenly smile, like the most beautiful lily in the night, silent smile in the wind, her white body posture is as dazzling as the moonlight. The ghost stopped breathing.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi suddenly opened her mouth, word by word: &ldquo;I am very happy!&rdquo; Then, she still smile, eyes soft like lingering waves.</p>
<p>The night is deeper and the moon is deep.</p>
<p>Standing side by side on the cliff in front of the moon watching platform, we look at the darkness ahead. The mountain wind blows, and the clothes of the two people float at the same time, and their figures are in the clear moonlight.</p>
<p>Gentle, is the wind blowing on the face of the feeling!</p>
<p>In the boundless and dark sky, there are still a few stars shining quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did the people of incense Valley propose to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a long silence, Lu Xueqi calmly said, &ldquo;yes, master and master have agreed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghostly voice did not sound any change, light way: &ldquo;I come on the way, hear your several elder martial sisters talk, hear you do not want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi laughed and said, &ldquo;yes, I don&rsquo;t want to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at her in a twinkling of an eye. What came into sight was Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s indifferent face and a faint smile between her eyebrows. He was suddenly excited, as if from the deep heart of the excitement, even the body also gently shaking, can not help but blurt out: &ldquo;you go with me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s body trembled and looked at him. No, what was in her eyes at the moment was still Zhang Xiaofan at the beginning! That persistent and persistent youth?</p>
<p>Where are we going?</p>
<p>Whatever you want! the remotest corners of the globe!</p>
<p>There was a smile in her mouth, but there was a twinkle in her eyes, as if she was hesitating. But after a moment, she finally said softly, &ldquo;what about the Biyao?&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such as a basin of cold water poured from the beginning, ghost Li&rsquo;s whole body is cold, from the depths of the heart out of the cold seems to freeze him into ice. Water green figure, peaceful smile, the beautiful figure lying on the ice stone platform, in a flash, completely knocked him down.</p>
<p>He looked down in silence for a long time. Then, when he raised his head again, the excitement on his face had disappeared. Instead, he was indifferent. Lu Xueqi was staring at his changes. She felt clearly that the man in front of her body was gradually moving away from the lingering warmth and hiding in the cold darkness.</p>
<p>She breathed deeply, the corners of her mouth showed a smile, but who could see the faint tears in the corners of her eyes? The beauty that shook the soul at that moment!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next time,&rdquo; ghost Li turned around and walked away slowly. &ldquo;When we meet again, you can use your sword.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His head does not return to leave, such as the determined lover broke the love, the moonlight follows behind him, like a tender hand powerless to pull, but eventually can not hold his figure.</p>
<p>He disappeared in the dark, that&rsquo;s where he came from and where he left!</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s pale face is still hung with some stiff faint smile. Her white dress is like snow dancing in the wind. In the moonlight, until, she silently shed her first tear.</p>
<p>The teardrop bamboo all over the mountain, in the moonlight, in such a desolate night, rustling (to be continued.</p>
