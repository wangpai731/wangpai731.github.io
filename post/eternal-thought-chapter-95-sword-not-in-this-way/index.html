      <p>&ldquo;Uncle Bai What a man of God</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle Bai, this is the rhythm of going to the end on the road of public enemy on the north bank&hellip;&rdquo; When people on the south bank looked at Bai Xiaochun one by one, they all showed admiration. They were convinced from the bottom of their hearts.</p>
<p>Even a lot of people are glad that such a disaster as Bai Xiaochun is not from the north bank. Otherwise, they can&rsquo;t imagine how much trauma the south bank will suffer this time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the South Bank of our country, it&rsquo;s OK to have a uncle Bai. He can make the whole north bank crazy by himself.&rdquo; Xu Baocai has been silly for many times in this day, but he still finds that Bai Xiaochun is so strong There is no end.</p>
<p>But no matter what, even if the Tianjiao battle has changed its flavor, it is still going on. When the south bank admires and the north bank is crazy, the fourth round of the third round begins.</p>
<p>Shangguan Tianyou, guiya and Bai Xiaochun all won three games in a row. This time, they didn&rsquo;t need them to take the stage. What they had to do was to compete for the total ranking of 456.</p>
<p>Gongsun&rsquo;s brother and sister and Xu Song quickly fought each other on the stage. In the end, gongsunyun defeated Gongsun Waner and defeated Xu Song. There was no need to continue the competition. He was first out and ranked fourth in the total ranking.</p>
<p>Although Xu Song was not as good as Gongsun Yun, he won the first battle with Gongsun Waner, and finally won one game. He was also out of the game, ranking fifth in the total ranking.</p>
<p>As for Gongsun Waner, she failed in all of the five games and became the sixth place in the overall ranking.</p>
<p>The next thing to be done is the first three permutations of this Tianjiao battle! The ranking of Bai Xiaochun, Shangguan Tianyou and guiya has attracted the attention of disciples from both sides of the Strait.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that every time people on the north bank see Bai Xiaochun, they are angry. They can confirm the ghost tooth and Shangguan Tianyou, but Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s shamelessness and meanness are also recognized by the north bank.</p>
<p>At the moment, all the hopes of the north bank are placed in the ghost teeth. In their view, even if Bai Xiaochun has any more conspiracy, he will be destroyed in the face of absolute power.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first stop, Bai Xiaochun, Shangguan Tianyou!&rdquo; Ouyang Jie&rsquo;s voice, it seems, also because of the appearance of Bai Xiaochun, lost the cold, with a trace of emotion.</p>
<p>Shangguan Tianyou suddenly raised his head with a sharp flash in his eyes. At the beginning of the qualification contest, the scene that he was surpassed by Bai Xiaochun came to his mind. His eyes showed Ling mang. He stepped onto the battle platform, and the wind from the mountains lifted his long hair. At this moment, Shangguan Tianyou looked handsome and extraordinary, like a sword, which made countless disciples show their brilliance.</p>
<p>However, the people on the south bank dare not applaud. After all, Bai Xiaochun is also from the south bank. Moreover, Bai Xiaochun has too many means. They are afraid that if they applaud, they will be remembered by Bai Xiaochun, and they can only resist it one by one.</p>
<p>On the contrary, it was the north bank who cheered for Shangguan Tianyou at the moment. This cheering made Shangguan Tianyou feel uncomfortable. He knew that the north bank was not because of himself, but because of Bai Xiaochun. In other words, even if it was a pig who was fighting with Bai Xiaochun, the north bank would cheer for the pig. In this way, Shangguan Tianyou was even more displeased with Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>With a dry cough, Bai Xiaochun stepped onto the battle platform and looked at Shangguan Tianyou. He shook his sleeve and grinned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it. We are all&hellip;&rdquo; Before he finished, Shangguan Tianyou&rsquo;s eyes burst out, and his right hand raised a finger. At once, a flying sword beside him made a sharp sound of breaking the sky. In an instant, it flew out, like a flash of lightning, and appeared directly in front of Bai Xiaochun. The speed was too fast, and the distance was less than seven feet!</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s eyes shrank in an instant. At the critical moment, his body squatted fiercely. A sword wind roared over his head. Even a wisp of hair was cut off and fell from Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friars, seize the day, even if you don&rsquo;t hide this sword, you won&rsquo;t be killed. Your character is obstinate and you lack of education. Since your parents didn&rsquo;t educate you, I&rsquo;ll give you a lesson. In the future, you should remember this point. Don&rsquo;t use those devious ways to disgrace our south bank.&rdquo; When Shangguan Tianyou spoke faintly, his flying sword came back in an instant and floated in front of him.</p>
<p>The north bank was quiet for a moment and cheered. But here on the south bank, everyone was silent. When they looked at Shangguan Tianyou, they all showed dissatisfaction. Even those who had followed Shangguan Tianyou before, they all frowned.</p>
<p>They have no aversion to Bai Xiaochun. In their opinion, although he is naughty, he is not excessive. Although he is helpless, he will love him from the bottom of his heart. Even if the north bank hates him to the bone, he can come from the south bank. Bai Xiaochun represents the south bank to fight. All his things are the glory of the south bank.</p>
<p>Even everyone can see that Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s opening just now clearly wants to admit defeat. Obviously, he is not willing to fight with Shangguan Tianyou. Moreover, there is another meaning that he wants to let Shangguan Tianyou save spiritual power and fight for the biggest win in the battle with ghost teeth.</p>
<p>Shangguan Tianyou couldn&rsquo;t have heard that, but he still wanted to attack, almost in the form of a sneak attack. He even taught a lesson and insulted his parents. This behavior made many people in Nan&rsquo;an look down upon!</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun crouched down, staring at the falling hair in front of him. He put away his smile. When he got up and looked up, he looked at Shangguan Tianyou, and the words of the other party&rsquo;s lesson still echoed in his ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are arrogant and look down on me. It doesn&rsquo;t matter. I don&rsquo;t care what others think.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun spoke in a deep voice. At this moment, he seemed to be different from usual.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you attack me secretly, that&rsquo;s all. I practice for longevity. I don&rsquo;t like to fight and kill.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun raised his right hand, pulled off those dark charms on his body and threw them aside. In this moment, there was a faint sense of iron and blood on his body, which gradually rose.</p>
<p>In the crowd on the south bank, Hou Yunfei&rsquo;s eyes coagulate and his body vibrates uncontrollably. He looks at Bai Xiaochun at this moment. The familiar feeling that he felt when he was in the Luochen family appeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what qualifications do you have Teach me a lesson for my parents Bai Xiaochun suddenly raised his head, blood in his eyes, his parents left early, which had a great impact on him, and even the reason why he wanted to live forever had a great connection with it.</p>
<p>His character is optimistic, which he deliberately put out from childhood. If he is not optimistic, a young child saw his father and mother die, and lived with his parents&rsquo; bodies for several days in the room. He would not believe it. He cried for his father and mother, until the body smelled, until the villagers buried him. He stayed for a long time, even for a period of time, he liked to talk to himself Talk about Such a child, after growing up, this life will be dark.</p>
<p>He used laughter instead of crying, and turned his yearning into a belief in longevity. He always remembered the words of his parents before their death that they would not give up and let themselves live well.</p>
<p>He is mischievous, but he has discretion. Many things he didn&rsquo;t mean to do. His heart is always kind.</p>
<p>He is afraid of death, and even gives people the feeling of cowardice, but in the face of peer crisis, love triumphs over death, he can roar, tremble back to fight for death.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s funny, but he&rsquo;s affectionate, Zhang daphou, Li Qinghou, Hou Yunfei, Du Lingfei, Hou Xiaomei, headmaster, all the people who are good to him, he will remember all his life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What qualifications do you have?&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s body burst out with a bang. The speed was so fast that he suddenly appeared in front of Shangguan Tianyou. Shangguan Tianyou&rsquo;s eyes shrank suddenly, and his hair stood up. Before he could react, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s fist, with a silver light, fell.</p>
<p>With a bang, the light of protection on Shangguan Tianyou appeared. However, the light of protection could not be blocked at all. In an instant, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s fist fell on a small shield which appeared quickly in front of Shangguan Tianyou.</p>
<p>With a bang, the shield trembled, and was hit by Bai Xiaochun directly, hitting Shangguan Tianyou&rsquo;s chest. Shangguan Tianyou spurted blood, and his body was vigorously pushed. After stepping back more than ten steps, the blood spurted out again, and his face showed disbelief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is Tianjiao?&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun spoke lightly. At this moment, he didn&rsquo;t lift his chin, and did not show the lonely appearance of an expert. However, at this moment, he gave everyone a feeling like the scorching sun. Countless inspirations came from the south bank, and all the north bank was shocked.</p>
<p>Ghost teeth eyes burst out of fine awn, the leader on the terrace and others, all look changed, look dignified.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bai Xiaochun!&rdquo; Shangguan Tianyou feels humiliated. He roars. When he pinches the formula with both hands, five flying swords suddenly appear outside his body. Each of these five flying swords, each of which emits amazing sword spirit, runs straight to Bai Xiaochun under the control of Shangguan Tianyou&rsquo;s sword spirit gymnastics.</p>
<p>The speed is so fast that it seems to have turned into five sword dragons with a thickness of half a Zhang and a length of more than ten Zhang. Some of them collide with each other, some jump out of the arc and roar away, and even cracks appear in the battle platform. With this momentum, one sword can kill ordinary disciples, and two swords can kill other arrogants. For example, Tianjiao, such as Gongsun Yun, also admits defeat under the three swords. At the moment, the five swords appear. In a moment, the whole battle platform is full of sword spirit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know the sword technique, and I don&rsquo;t have the body of the sword spirit, but in my opinion, the sword It&rsquo;s not used like that Bai Xiaochun calmly opened his mouth, raised a finger with his right hand, and immediately turned the golden black sword into a golden light, and flew out in an instant. In front of him, he cut a sword in front of him!</p>
<p>You can have three swords or five swords. I only have one!</p>
<p>When the sword was cut off, it made a huge noise and formed a sword storm!</p>
<p>If this sword is cut off, you can lift light as light as you can, and it also contains lifting light like heavy!</p>
<p>With this sword cut off, the spirit power in Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s body is accurate, without any waste of volatilization!</p>
<p>He really doesn&rsquo;t know how to use a sword. He knows how to control the tripod with purple Qi. He knows that lifting a heavy piece of wood with a leaf can&rsquo;t lift a heavy piece of wood. But if you roll the leaves together, you can lift stones, tear the leaves into strips and weave them together, and you can lift bigger rocks!</p>
<p>He knew that it was the use of spiritual power!</p>
<p>One way, not ten thousand, but in condensate With his undead silver skin, is invincible!</p>
<p>Boom! Boom!</p>
<p>When the five swords of Shangguan Tianyou were touched, the five swords were all twisted, and all of them broke out. However, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s sword storm broke out in front of Shangguan Tianyou.</p>
<p>The wind set off Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s long hair. He stood on the battle platform with a calm look. He did not carry his hands or swing his sleeves. But this calm, against the backdrop of the sword storm, became an eternal picture and was deeply imprinted in the hearts of all the disciples on both sides of the Strait.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He really is Bai Xiaochun At this moment, everyone&rsquo;s heart was shocked.</p>
