      <p>In a flash of time, in the past few months, Bai Xiaochun was very familiar with the area of Xiangyun mountain&rsquo;s inner disciples, and the freshness of becoming an inner disciple gradually diminished.</p>
<p>Most of them are in the cave. They either practice or refine the elixir in the refining pharmacy. He also refined a lot of oestrus pills.</p>
<p>In such a day, he felt very happy. For him, practice is for long life, so that his cultivation is higher and higher, so as to obtain a longer life.</p>
<p>And refining the elixir is his interest. His ideal is to refine the elixir of immortality. For this great dream, he keeps refining the elixir, which is just the cruelty of reality. After a few months, Bai Xiaochun finds that he has no herbs.</p>
<p>Even if you have the ten thousand spirit stone, which is the first reward for Tianjiao battle, you can&rsquo;t buy the materials needed to refine the third level elixir. Even if you entrust those Xiuzhen families, the price is too high.</p>
<p>The best way is to have enough contribution points and go to the sect for exchange.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Contribution point&hellip;&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun is sitting in the cave with a sad face. What he lacks most is the contribution point. Now he hesitates for a while. He resolutely goes out of the cave and goes to the stone tablet where the inner disciples give the task.</p>
<p>This place is different from the sea of people in the outer gate mission area. There are not many disciples in the inner gate here. They are all in a hurry. It seems that time is precious. When Bai Xiaochun comes, she stands there and looks at the stone tablet of the task and chooses to go.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be dangerous</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t give less contribution!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Long term can&rsquo;t be&hellip;&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun murmured, and finally his eyes fell on a task, which was issued by the patriarch of the clan. He needed to send out the core of the beast, a kernel, and offered a high price of 1000 contribution points.</p>
<p>In the barren mountains not far from Lingxi, Bai Xiaochun pondered for a moment. This kind of jimie is introduced in the fourth chapter of spirit beast. To be exact, it is not a fierce beast, but a magical life relying on parasitism.</p>
<p>It will choose to parasite on some fierce animals, so that the fierce animals will have an extra head, until the head is completely formed, the fierce beast withers and dies, and the jimie beast matures and turns into a nine day bird.</p>
<p>Strangely, in the parasitism stage, this beast has great medicinal value. However, if it breaks its skull after it matures and becomes a nine day bird, its whole body will have no value at all. Even the nine day bird can only survive for nine days. Its only mission is to choose a fierce beast again and continue to parasitize before it dies.</p>
<p>Like samsara</p>
<p>In a sense, this kind of killing beast is a rare and eternal thing, which has always existed in endless reincarnation.</p>
<p>When Bai Xiaochun had memorized the fourth chapter of the spirit beast, he was also very impressed by this letter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The difficulty of this task is to search for jimie animals. The barren mountains are too big. It is very troublesome to search one by one, and it will take a long time. Therefore, such a high contribution point is given.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun also inspected the barren mountains. He knew that although there was a large area there, most of the fierce animals were under the foundation, and few of them were comparable to those of the foundation.</p>
<p>After thinking for a moment, Bai Xiaochun took the task and did not set out immediately. Instead, he went back to the cave and straightened out. After that, he went out and set foot on the Jinwu sword and left quickly.</p>
<p>The barren mountains are not far away from lingxizong. At the speed of Bai Xiaochun, he can fly in one day. However, he does not have enough training. Sometimes he flies and sometimes runs across the earth. In this way, after four days, he finally comes to the barren mountains.</p>
<p>This place is majestic. From a distance, you can see the ups and downs of mountains everywhere, as if you can&rsquo;t see the end. The ground is green, forming a dense jungle, and from time to time, there are birds and animals chirping.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun wandered around the barren mountains until half a month later, he found a valley. In the barren mountain range, this is the place where the forest passes through. In this valley, Bai Xiaochun sits on a big tree and looks at the valley area in front of him. His eyes slowly show his brilliance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too time-consuming to use the normal method, and it&rsquo;s just a chance. If you&rsquo;re lucky, you may find one. If you&rsquo;re not lucky, it&rsquo;s hard to find one in a month.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This time, it&rsquo;s time to embody my wisdom.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun raised his chin, his body shook and suddenly left.</p>
<p>A day later, Bai Xiaochun felt the direction of the downwind in a mountain. He was about to take the love pill. He suddenly remembered something and called out to all around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there anyone? Is there any fellow Lingxi clan here? &quot; His voice was so sharp that it sounded as if he was calling for help.</p>
<p>In the distance, there is a figure in the jungle. At the moment, he is fighting with a fierce beast. He looks cold and arrogant. He is wearing the robe of the inner disciples of Lingxi clan. He hears Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s cry from a distance, showing contempt in his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s another disciple who came here because he didn&rsquo;t have enough practice. What&rsquo;s the use of shouting at this moment? Only the strong can come to this barren mountain range.&rdquo; He looked disdainful and did not have the idea of rescuing. After all, although zongmen talked about unity, there were still some people who had a cold nature, which was inevitable.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun yelled for a long time, but no one answered. He was relieved and quickly threw out a handful of estrus pills. In the bang, all the pills exploded and turned into powder and went away with the wind.</p>
<p>No matter what the wind blows, all the things come out.</p>
<p>The roar reverberated, and Bai Xiaochun heard the wings behind her back and went straight to the distance.</p>
<p>Suddenly, after the roar, he was still in the area of cold and fierce, and all of a sudden, there was no shock in his eyes.</p>
<p>But in the moment he avoided, all the fierce animals in this area all roared and rushed out one by one. Their eyes were red and all of them were crazy. The young man was terrified and ran for his life. A large number of fierce animals roared after him, frightening him to call for help.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that Bai Xiaochun walked away and couldn&rsquo;t hear</p>
<p>Three hours later, in the area of a wind outlet, Bai Xiaochun called out again. After waiting for someone to respond, he threw down a lot of estrus pills.</p>
<p>Soon, in this area, there was also a roar.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun didn&rsquo;t stop. In the next two days, he took the valley as the center, and dropped the faqingdan in all the areas around. This large area was connected together. The powder of faqingdan covered all directions, which made all the fierce beasts in this area crazy, and the roaring sound was more intense, even furious and rampant.</p>
<p>When he was about to lose control, Bai Xiaochun quickly returned to the valley he had first chosen. Here, his eyes were shining and he waved the golden black sword. After sweeping a road, he took out a large number of female fragrant pills, crushed them carefully and sprinkled them here. Gradually, the fragrance here was very rich.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun was very cautious and carefully avoided. When she quickly retreated, she changed a suit of clothes. After making sure that she was not contaminated with the powder of female Xiangdan, she hid in the valley and looked down at the path below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fierce beast, darling Come on. &quot; Xiaoyang is waiting for Xiaoyang.</p>
<p>As time went by, with the spread of the fragrance of female Xiangdan, slowly, all the fierce animals in this large area were already crazy under the stimulation of oestrus pill. At the moment, they suddenly smelled the female fragrance, roared wildly, and rushed towards the valley. Soon, more and more fierce beasts ran wild, almost becoming an animal tide, and the ground was shaking.</p>
<p>After a while, when the first wave of ferocious beasts arrived, Bai Xiaochun immediately stood up and looked down. In a blink of an eye, a large number of fierce beasts with different shapes were flying by on the path in the valley. All kinds of roaring roared. Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s eyes widened and looked at the countless fierce beasts below. Suddenly, her eyes flashed and her right hand pinched a finger. Immediately, the golden black sword flew out and went straight to the group A tiger among the beasts.</p>
<p>On the back of the tiger beast, there was a second head. The golden light flashed. The second head exploded instantly, and a core flew out. It was caught by Bai Xiaochun. After being thrown into the storage bag, the golden light flew again and went straight to another fierce beast with a second head in the distance.</p>
<p>For a long time, even the valley was shaking, as if to be smashed by those fierce beasts. Bai Xiaochun was flying with flying colors. He manipulated the flying sword and kept shining until the tide gradually dissipated. He was overjoyed to find that he had collected ten cores of killing animals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m still smart.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun complacently looked at the inner core of the storage bag. His body shook and left this large area to go to the next area.</p>
<p>Until Bai Xiaochun left for a long time, in this area, in the jungle, a young man&rsquo;s clothes were damaged, his appearance was miserable, his body was shaking, he struggled to walk step by step, he wanted to cry without tears, his eyes were at a loss, he looked faint, as if like the north cold</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with the barren mountains What&rsquo;s wrong with this world The fierce animals here don&rsquo;t eat people, but I I&hellip; &quot; Tears came out of his eyes and he was out of his wits.</p>
<p>Every day, when he throws Wild Medicine in the mountains, there is no time for him to throw wild drugs.</p>
<p>Several times, some disciples immediately responded. At this time, Bai Xiaochun would tell the other party about her plan with apology and sent a kernel as a token of thanks to persuade people to leave. She also hoped that they would tell other students that they would send a kernel of gratitude when they left here during this period of time. Many of the disciples who saw Bai Xiaochun immediately recognized Bai Xiaochun After Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s plan, everyone&rsquo;s body trembled and ran quickly.</p>
