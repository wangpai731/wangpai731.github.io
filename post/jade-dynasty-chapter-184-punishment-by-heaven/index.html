      <p>On the jade wall without words, countless ancient and clumsy gold characters appeared. Such strange things are under the people of Puhong, and none of the monks in Tianyin temple have ever seen it. On the jade wall, there were auspicious rising and dark red flickering. The solemn golden light with strange and unpredictable red light gave people a feeling of breathlessness.</p>
<p>In the middle of the sky, he looked up to the sky and screamed, and his eyes seemed to be very painful. Then he moved his eyes to the jade wall without words and looked at the countless rolling and undulating fonts carefully. Around his body, the strange light of soul biting became more and more bright, and the Demon power emanating from his body became more and more powerful.</p>
<p>Even the Tianyin Temple monks on the ground felt an unprecedented cold breath, which came from the air and shrouded them. After three days and three nights of training of Buddhist array, the power of blood sucking demon seems not to be weakened, but it seems to have been fully stimulated, which is unprecedented.</p>
<p>There was anxiety on Pu Hong&rsquo;s face. At this critical moment, his face was as changeable as that in the sky, and he was hesitant.</p>
<p>But Pufang was a little worried. He looked at the ghost in the sky, which was bathed in the dark blue light. His brow was tight. He called out to master Puhong: &ldquo;what should I do now, elder martial brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong took a long breath and resolutely said, &ldquo;this man is a descendant of Puzhi junior brother, and is also the place of his lifelong ambition. We can&rsquo;t help it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as the words fell, master Pu Hong gave an order and sat down again. He praised the Buddha, and the sound of Sanskrit singing rose again. Then, the monks of Tianyin Temple saw the abbot practicing the Dharma and followed him one after another. A moment later, a solemn golden light rose again from the monks of Tianyin temple.</p>
<p>However, the Buddha&rsquo;s light and golden light is different from that of the Buddha array which turned into ghosts three days ago. In contrast, the ghost in the sky seems to have not noticed the golden light gradually rising from the ground under his feet to cover himself. His spirit at the moment seemed to be completely attracted by the words flashing on the jade wall without words.</p>
<p>No one would have thought that even if the monks of Tianyin temple under the wordless jade wall had seen it with their own eyes, they could not understand it at a glance, and they were flashing out on the wordless jade wall at the moment.</p>
<p>On the jade wall, the holy land most revered by Buddhists, it is the fourth volume of the classic book of heaven!</p>
<p>The way of heaven is vast and the world is changeable. Who can predict how many points?</p>
<p>The monks of Tianyin temple worship Buddha Day and night, which is still unknown; the ghost has experienced ups and downs. The vicissitudes of life, but also can not know!</p>
<p>Just at the moment of the ghost, but where still want to get so much, in his eyes, almost instinctively attracted by these flashing words.</p>
<p>The ups and downs of the words and phrases are astonishing to show all the fractures and incomprehensions in his previous hard study of the book of heaven. For example, when a pedestrian is facing numerous cliffs and cliffs on the road ahead, he is hesitating, and suddenly there is a road on the cliff and a torrent across the bridge. What a happy state it is. How can you be distracted?</p>
<p>For a moment, many difficult and obscure places in the past practice suddenly seemed to open up one after another. Ten years ago, when I saw the general outline of the first volume of the book of heaven in the blood dripping cave of the ten thousand bat ancient cave in kongsang mountain, the time has passed like a tide in the past ten years. This man stood between the clouds of the sky and felt for the first time that he was breathing with heaven and earth, but forgetting everything.</p>
<p>Breathe, breathe deeply!</p>
<p>From head to toe, every part of the body seems to explode. He was surrounded by countless strange noises. All kinds of breath in the body are boiling, like huge waves and surging. Blood sucking Demon power is cold. The pure Yang Qi of XuanHuo is fiery; Taiji Xuanqing Dao is peaceful and upright, and the great Brahma Prajna is as solemn as a mountain; moreover, the Qi of the three volumes of the book of heaven, which has been practiced by ghosts and Li in the past, is extremely strong.</p>
<p>Heaven and earth change, nature is mysterious!</p>
<p>Under the dark clouds, the strange light of the figure in the sky was getting brighter and brighter under the darkening sky. It has the power to go against the heaven. Thunder rumbled in the sky, and lightning began to move in the clouds, as if the heart of heaven was already angry. In the clouds, the strong wind, the cloud curtain slowly began to rotate, on the top of the ghost, gradually seems to show the appearance of a huge vortex.</p>
<p>However, his eyes are still attracted to the jade wall without words. He seems to know nothing about his body.</p>
<p>At this moment, the voice of Sanskrit singing on the ground was very loud, and the solemn and golden light rose to the sky, and the ghost in the sky was immediately enveloped in it. This golden light is so strong that it gathers the power of dozens of Tianyin Temple monks. It is not unusual. It immediately suppresses the evil power light from Gui Li and covers it.</p>
<p>With the golden light, it seems that the thunder and lightning in the sky seems to be restrained and gradually weakened. The weird huge vortex that was slowly forming on the sky seems to be gradually fading away.</p>
<p>Looking at the sky, master Pu Hong slowly breathed a sigh of relief, and suddenly heard the withered old monk next to him coldly say: &ldquo;this man&rsquo;s practice has triggered the&rdquo; heavenly punishment and severe thunder &ldquo;. We can see that the evil spirit is so strong that heaven can not tolerate it. The abbot is desperate to rescue him, but he may not be right. &quot;</p>
<p>Master Puhong&rsquo;s face changed and he turned to look at him. The haggard old monk looked at him coldly. Master Puhong was speechless for a moment. In fact, it&rsquo;s not the right way for master Pu Hong to feel the strange and killing power of ghosts and Li. It&rsquo;s hard to say whether he&rsquo;s right or not. However, as long as you think of Puzhi&rsquo;s younger brother, who died with hatred, and his great compassion in the face of Puzhi&rsquo;s Dharma remains a few days ago, the deeply moved master Puhong can&rsquo;t abandon it.</p>
<p>At the moment, master Pu Hong was speechless. After a long time, he was about to speak. Suddenly, there was a commotion around him. Many people breathed softly. At the same time, there was a strange smell in the Dharma array. He looked up quickly and his face changed suddenly.</p>
<p>Under the suppression and protection of the Buddhist array, which was jointly urged by many Tianyin Temple monks, the Demon power on GUI Li has been pressed down and wrapped in the golden light array. The mysterious wind and cloud in the sky could not be found, and was slowly disappearing. Unexpectedly, at the moment, the ghost was suppressed to a faint light, and suddenly again bright again, and the turbulent breath was even better than before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boom!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A thunder burst in the sky.</p>
<p>The strong wind, thunder, the ghost once again roared up to the sky, flashing light all over the body. Green, red, gold and red flowed continuously, and finally slowly converged and merged, which turned into the simplest black and white gas. However, the black and white gas was also quite strange. Sometimes it&rsquo;s white, sometimes it&rsquo;s black. It&rsquo;s unpredictable, but it&rsquo;s faint and powerful, which is felt by all the monks in Tianyin temple.</p>
<p>In the air. The golden light array, which contains the magic power of ten monks in Tianyin temple, can&rsquo;t resist the impact of the new Dharma from Gui Li, and gradually weakens. At the same time, the clouds and clouds were rolling in the sky, and the huge whirlpool appeared again, and this speed was faster than before, and it was forming rapidly, and it was above the ghost.</p>
<p>From the ground to the sky, I saw the clouds whirling wildly. The thunder rumbled, and there was a strange &ldquo;silk&rdquo; whistling sound, like the ferocious mouth of the sky, who was about to choose a person to eat.</p>
<p>Most of the monks on the ground felt pain at the moment, and it was more and more difficult to maintain the golden light array. At the moment, not only did the ghost and fierce fight against the golden light from the array, but also, above the curtain of heaven, within the mysterious whirlpool, there was an irresistible force from the sky to the bottom, tightly against the golden light array.</p>
<p>Golden light array of enemies on both sides. The light was fading rapidly. Master Pu Hong and others were all shocked. At this moment, however, the sky thundered. From the whirlpool, where the bottom of the whirlpool is not visible, a thick electric light bombards from the sky and hits the golden light array.</p>
<p>All the monks in the temple are red in their faces. Some have already vomited blood. The golden light array flickered and finally disintegrated and became invisible.</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong was upset. As the leader of the array, he was greatly shocked. But at the moment, his mind was above the sky, and under his anxiety, he stood up.</p>
<p>The golden light array was scattered, and the ghost was no longer suppressed. The pressure on the body dissipated in an instant. However, I felt that the whole body was one of the pines, and the new breath of Zhenyuan in the body was constantly circulating for a moment, and it was extremely happy.</p>
<p>However, before he could do something to disturb the heart of heaven, he could only see the dark clouds deep in the sky. In the roar of thunder, like a column of light descending from the sky, Pei could not be appropriate. He wanted to run through the heaven and earth. He was bombarded by the thunder, which was coming to him.</p>
<p>The place I passed was extremely blazing, and the sound of hissing around the light column was endless. I wonder if it was because the temperature was too high that everything around it was forged.</p>
<p>And what we are facing is the great power of the heaven and earth. There is no way to avoid, no place to hide</p>
<p>Seeing that Gui Li was about to be hit by the huge beam of light, master Pu Hong and other monks couldn&rsquo;t bear to watch, and turned their heads one after another. Master Puhong was even more distressed. However, he could not understand that he had a good intention to turn the evil spirit out of him. How could it become such a result, which has not been seen in thousands of years, only exists in biography The sky in the middle of the story, Li Lei!</p>
<p>Is it true that God can not tolerate this man?</p>
<p>The column of light arrived in a twinkling of an eye, but before reaching the body, he looked pale and opened his mouth in the loud and violent wind. However, no sound was heard at all, and they were submerged in the great power of heaven and earth. But seeing that he was covered by the divine power of heaven and earth, his seven orifices were bleeding and his face was sad and desperate. That is to say, in the past, he had been loyal to protect his soul eating magic wand, and now he is facing the punishment of heaven, and he is also suppressed.</p>
<p>Everything seems to be over!</p>
<p>From the majestic sky, it seems that there is also a faint elegy echoing in the sky.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, the wordless jade wall, which had been gradually dim behind GUI Li, seemed to sense something. Countless flashing fonts flashed again, especially the nine big characters in the middle: Heaven and earth are not benevolent, taking all things as cudgels, which are dazzling and dazzling. When you look at the momentum, you can see that there is a faint trace of unruly arrogance.</p>
<p>Even if it is, in the face of countless people worship heaven, it seems that the invincible punishment of heaven, the light on the jade wall, has never had the slightest retreat!</p>
<p>The light on the wordless jade wall was as bright as the brightest spark, and no one could see it again. At the same time, there was a huge and incomparable radiance rising from the sky. The boundless momentum was directed against the mysterious whirlpool in the sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boom</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boom</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boom!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the sky, the thunder was deafening, and the sound seemed to have the power of splitting the sky. In a moment, the powerful celestial punishment light column moved a few minutes, left the ghostly body, and was splitting on the unyielding brilliance of the wordless jade wall!</p>
<p>Two columns of blazing light. The earth and the Earth collided with each other, the mountains on the ground vibrated, countless huge rock walls cracked and thunder rumbled. All animals howl, like the end of the world.</p>
<p>That day, the earth, can not directly look at the dazzling glory!</p>
<p>Heaven and earth solidify, as if at that moment.</p>
<p>On the jade wall without words, the stone wall was smooth as a mirror. From the middle of the stone wall, there was a crack, and then countless slits stretched out from the center to all directions and became bigger and bigger. Finally, in the noisy howl, a loud noise, this huge mountain wall rocks fly away, collapsed!</p>
<p>horizon. The huge column of light slowly dispersed, the low dark clouds seemed to have vent, the wind gradually stopped, the thunder also slowly stopped. Then, the sky seemed to return to calm, dark clouds gradually dispersed, the peaceful sky, gradually lit up.</p>
<p>A figure, slowly falling down from the air, is just ghostly. But at the moment, his face was covered with blood, and he was unconscious, and what protected him was a light of mysterious brilliance. After his body fell to the ground, he swayed a few times, and finally he scattered gently and disappeared.</p>
<p>The monks in Tianyin temple are staring at the fallen jade wall in front of them. They can&rsquo;t say a word.</p>
<p>This sleep. It seems like a long sleep.</p>
<p>It seems that there are many people walking around, very busy, and some people are talking with each other. Their voices are sometimes loud and sometimes they are quarrelling. But more often, it&rsquo;s still quiet.</p>
<p>He was in the dull silence, and he did not know how long he had slept. He felt vaguely, but he did not wake up.</p>
<p>Perhaps, such a deep sleep, but it is the expectation in his heart!</p>
<p>The sound of footsteps sounded outside the door. FA Xiang in the meditation room took a look outside. He quickly stood up and saluted the master Pu Hong who came in outside the door. Master Pu Hong nodded and looked at the ghost who was still sleeping on the Zen bed and said in a low voice, &ldquo;is he OK?&rdquo;</p>
<p>FA Xiang nodded his head and said: &ldquo;since then, benefactor Zhang has been in such a coma. But his breath is mild, there is no vision, and there are no other injuries in his body. He should have waked up long ago, but somehow, he is so sleepy? &quot;</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong pondered for a moment and said, &ldquo;he was lucky to escape under the severe thunder. He is extremely lucky.</p>
<p>I think that the punishment was a kind of heavenly power that can&rsquo;t be seen for thousands of years, but I don&rsquo;t want it to happen to him. Is it Is he really a monster that heaven can&rsquo;t tolerate? &quot;</p>
<p>As soon as FA Xiang&rsquo;s face changed, he took a look at master Puhong quietly, but there was no other color in his face. Then he quietly put his heart back and said in a low voice, &ldquo;master, are some martial uncles arguing with you again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong gave a bitter smile, but did not speak.</p>
<p>The law is silent.</p>
<p>After a long time, master Pu Hong said slowly, &ldquo;the wordless jade wall is the most precious treasure of the holy land of Tianyin temple, and it is also a Buddhist trace handed down by our ancestors. This time, it was destroyed by Tianxing because of my selfish intention. I have decided that after this benefactor Zhang wakes up, I will resign from the position of Abbot to all the monks in the temple, and from then on, I will understand Buddhism on the wall, so as to redeem my sin. &quot;</p>
<p>FA Xiang&rsquo;s face changed greatly and he said, &ldquo;master, how can you say that? It&rsquo;s not your fault!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong shook his head and said, &ldquo;your martial uncles are right. I am grateful to almsgiver Zhang for dissolving the grievances of Puzhi&rsquo;s Dharma body. Therefore, he made a rash decision and tried to transform it into a Buddhist holy land. It is my sin to bring about punishment and destroy the jade wall. It&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>He said this, but with a smile, he said to FA Xiang: &ldquo;but I have never regretted it. Do you know why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>FA Xiang is silent and shakes his head.</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong said with a smile: &ldquo;in that day, when the punishment was cut down, the benefactor had no luck, but the jade wall without words actually carried each other and saved the little benefactor. Although we don&rsquo;t know why this happened here, the reason why we don&rsquo;t want to see benefactor Zhang die under heaven&rsquo;s punishment is that the jade wall is channeling spirits. Since the jade wall is still like this, it can be seen that I am not wrong. Therefore, of course, it is my fault to destroy the jade wall. I intend to plead for it, but I have no regrets in my heart. &quot;</p>
<p>FA Xiang clenched his teeth, raised his head and called out, &ldquo;master&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong patted him on the shoulder, and with a smile, comforted him. He went to the ghost bed, looked at him carefully, nodded, and said, &ldquo;it seems that he looks very well. If there is no accident, I expect he will wake up in the next few days. You should take care of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master, don&rsquo;t worry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong nodded his head and took a fierce look. He turned around and went out.</p>
<p>Just at the moment when he was about to step out of the door, suddenly, the ghostly body on the Zen bed moved, and a low voice came out of his mouth.</p>
<p>FA Xiang&rsquo;s body was shocked and said happily, &ldquo;master, he seems to wake up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Overjoyed, master Pu Hong came over and sat on the edge of the bed. Under the eyes of the master and the apprentice, I saw the fierce eyes moving gently, and finally opened them slowly. (to be continued. )</p>
