      <p>He opened his eyes slowly in the dark.</p>
<p>Around a dark, and then, not far ahead, slowly lit up a faint light, like a faint candle in the night, quietly burning.</p>
<p>He looked at it silently. The light was light lavender, then turning blue, then slowly turning dark green. Then he kept changing and flashing all kinds of lights. It was very beautiful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Squeak, squeak&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>All of a sudden, just beside him, there was the low voice of the little grey monkey. It seemed that it was in this darkness that even its voice could not be too loud.</p>
<p>Guili turned his head and saw the little grey monkey squatting beside him in the dim light.</p>
<p>He smiled and bit his teeth subconsciously. He wanted to hold back the pain and sit up first to see the surrounding situation. Unexpectedly, he turned over and sat up smoothly, without any pain in his whole body. He sat up smoothly and profitably, which surprised him.</p>
<p>In the dark, the light of changing color shines gently on him. Seeing the whole body inside, ghost Li was hurt by the black water Xuan snake just now. Somehow, all of a sudden, it was incredibly recovered.</p>
<p>He frowned a little. He was really surprised, but for a moment he couldn&rsquo;t think of any reason. He wanted to stand up and have a good look around him.</p>
<p>At the thought of this place, his body was still moving. Suddenly, he stopped again. It seemed that his body was suddenly stiff.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know when to start. In his hand, he still holds another palm, a white, long and gentle hand.</p>
<p>They hold so tightly, so naturally, that people forget that their hands are still together.</p>
<p>Ghost Li was stunned, and then slowly looked to the side, the quiet light, in the dark gently floating, printed that cold beautiful face. Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s eyes are still closed, and her face is still pale, at the corner of her mouth. It seems that there is also a touch of blood, just like the strange red petals, falling on the white face like the first snow.</p>
<p>Her lips, slightly pursed. As if still with a light smile.</p>
<p>Silence!</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s eyes, gazing in the dark, time like water, ten years of time. Deeply engraved in life, but like, everything has never happened, just yesterday.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boom!&rdquo;</p>
<p>All of a sudden, a loud noise broke out in this dark space, suddenly shaking the mountains, accompanied by the distant sound of the Phoenix and the roar of rage, the whole dark space vibrated violently. The little ash made a strange cry and turned into a gourd. He stumbled to the side and fell to the ground with a plop. Ghost Li also can&rsquo;t sit down for a moment and lean to the side.</p>
<p>And the force of the shock shook Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s body. She seemed to wake up suddenly with a slight shout in her mouth. She opened her eyes with her body askew.</p>
<p>The first thing that came into my eyes was darkness, then the familiar face. Sit by your side.</p>
<p>Like, ten years ago, under the abyss of death, merciless sea!</p>
<p>The vibration eased down slowly, and the peace was restored. I don&rsquo;t know what happened to the violent vibration?</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi slowly sat up and looked at GUI Li. GUI Li didn&rsquo;t dodge either. She looked at her generally. A moment later, their eyes were all lowered. Those two hands are tightly and naturally held together.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi is silent and speechless. She is motionless. The fierce lips moved a bit, then slowly let go of the hand and took it back.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi looked at the hand that had shrunk back into the darkness, which was just a moment ago, and there was a touch of warmth coming from it. In her eyes, suddenly there was a faint sadness, and then disappeared again, recovered calm.</p>
<p>She stood up, at the same time, with a slight frown on her brow. It seemed that she was also surprised by the unexpected recovery of her injuries. Then she looked around and said quietly, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s this place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ghost Li also slowly stood up, said:&rdquo; I do not know, but I remember that we are flying into the Treasury of the emperor of heaven</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi was silent for a while, and said, &ldquo;did you save me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ghost Li looked at her for a moment, then light way: &ldquo;no, it&rsquo;s your own destiny, before the stone gate closed, fly in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi turned her head and looked at him expressionless. Her eyes were still bright in the dark, as if they were shining.</p>
<p>Ghost Li didn&rsquo;t look into her eyes, turned his head away, and began to walk towards the dim light. At the same time, he said, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t owe me anything. If you want to kill me, just do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi stood quietly in the dark behind him, stood for a long time, and then gently slapped his own body dust, finishing his appearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Squeak, squeak!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just now, the dizzy little ash that had been thrown by the earthquake recovered, jumped and ran to him, then jumped onto his shoulder, lying on his shoulder, and looked into the mysterious light.</p>
<p>As we got closer, what we saw became clear.</p>
<p>This is a wooden platform standing in the dark. Half a person is tall. A round wooden column about the thickness of the baby&rsquo;s arm is connected to the ground, and on the top is a small platform one foot in size.</p>
<p>In the middle of the platform, there is a cup with an ancient shape. It looks like it&rsquo;s made of wood. If you look carefully, you can see that the whole wooden platform and the cup are completely connected with the underground trees.</p>
<p>But the most attractive thing is in this small wooden cup. The wooden cup is about three inches high and two inches wide. There is a kind of transparent liquid in the middle, and there is a small transparent stone floating on the liquid in the cup, which is made of five flat surfaces and crystal clear. It is from this stone that soft light is emitted, forming a semicircle shaped light curtain on the small wooden platform, which refracts various kinds of light and radiates around.</p>
<p>At this moment, Lu Xueqi has also come over, standing beside the ghost and looking to the wooden cup.</p>
<p>In the air, there is a strange fragrance, which is everywhere. It makes people feel refreshed.</p>
<p>GUI Li and Lu Xueqi are not equal to each other, but they can&rsquo;t see what it is at the moment. In fact, the wooden platform and the cup in the treasure house of the emperor of heaven contain the magic medicine that is said to be hidden by the emperor of heaven. Both the wooden platform and the wooden cup are connected with the strange tree at the foot. The magic medicine is preserved by the spirit of the tree itself.</p>
<p>Outside the treasure house of the emperor of heaven, the ancient Warcraft, such as the black water black snake, coveted so much that they even fought against the yellow bird, the natural enemy guarding the magic medicine, which was just a cup of magic medicine.</p>
<p>The injuries of GUI Li and Lu Xueqi suddenly mysterious recovery. In fact, it&rsquo;s also related to the elixir and the treasure house.</p>
<p>But these legends and secrets are unknown today. Neither GUI Li nor Lu Xueqi know about them. Facing these talented treasures. But it&rsquo;s just a strange frown.</p>
<p>Just thinking about it, suddenly, there was another loud noise. The whole treasure house of the emperor of heaven was shaking violently. At the same time, the terrible roar of the black water black snake came again. It seems that the ancient giant beast is extremely angry and still refuses to give up the elixir.</p>
<p>Although the treasure house of the emperor of heaven is an ancient and strange place, at this moment, for a long time, and today, I don&rsquo;t know how many times it has been hit by the black water Xuan snake. Is the power of ancient Warcraft comparable? If it wasn&rsquo;t for the treasure house of the emperor of heaven, I would have been shoveled flat by the black water Xuan snake.</p>
<p>At the moment, I can only hear the sound around me, and the pain of hard trees reverberates everywhere. It&rsquo;s a terrifying twisting sound. At the same time, there is a violent movement in the treasure house, and a small gray scream. It almost falls off GUI Li&rsquo;s shoulder. GUI Li and Lu Xueqi just feel that they are shaking around, almost unstable.</p>
<p>In principle, under such a violent impact, even the whole wooden cup connected together will be poured out. But it&rsquo;s just when it&rsquo;s shaking violently. The stone floating on the water in the wooden cup suddenly rises a fine golden light, shoots straight up, shines on the light curtain, and immediately dyes the whole light curtain as gold. Then there was a flash of light.</p>
<p>Under the light curtain, the wooden platform, which seemed to be ready to move, suddenly stopped in the violent turbulence around. It was not until the shaking around became peaceful that the golden luster gradually weakened and returned to its original state.</p>
<p>GUI Li looks at Lu Xueqi. There is a color of surprise and admiration in his eyes. It&rsquo;s really amazing that he can do such wonderful things.</p>
<p>Ghost Li looked around again. With the light of this strange stone, he saw that there was nothing in the treasure house except this wooden platform. However, looking at this stone, it is crystal clear, with immortal spirit lingering in it. It&rsquo;s not a common thing. It seems that this is the strange treasure that has been searched for many days.</p>
<p>At the thought of this place, he felt the light curtain of the wooden platform.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t touch it!&rdquo; Suddenly, Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s voice suddenly became cold and began to ring around her.</p>
<p>The fierce hand stops in the mid air, then slowly shrinks back, turns around, faces Lu Xueqi.</p>
<p>They stood face to face, less than three feet away, but just now they were still vaguely warm between them. At this moment, they suddenly became cold, instead of the cold behind the silence.</p>
<p>Ghost Li looks at Lu Xueqi, slowly tunnel: &ldquo;I want this thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi looked into the man&rsquo;s eyes and said quietly, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t let you get it unless you kill me first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost and the fierce don&rsquo;t talk.</p>
<p>The weak light in the dark, gently flowing, changing the colorful color, as if also telling what?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boom!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s another big bang that rocked the price of the earth. It&rsquo;s the same shaking of the earth and mountains. But this time, it&rsquo;s bigger than before. Although the stone lifted up gold to protect the wooden platform, the walls around the treasure house of the emperor of heaven no longer seem to be able to support it.</p>
<p>With a hoarse crack, a huge piece of wood fell from the top of the head. GUI Li and Lu Xueqi jump away at the same time, and then the loud noise continues. The black water black snake outside seems to have been in a frenzy, hitting the treasure house of the emperor of heaven ceaselessly. At the same time, the Phoenix roars in the roar, and it is more angry and furious!</p>
<p>Outside, as if also is carrying on the earth shaking decisive battle!</p>
<p>Under the pressure of huge external forces, the whole treasure house of the emperor of heaven began to slowly deform, the walls on each side began to slowly sink inward, and the broken pieces of wood fell like rain.</p>
<p>In this case, both GUI Li and Lu Xueqi are only trying to avoid the huge pieces of wood falling down, and they can&rsquo;t go to the wooden platform for a while.</p>
<p>Seeing that the treasure house of the emperor of heaven is about to collapse, but at this time, it seems to be the magic power of the ancient gods. Suddenly, there is a much bigger and more dazzling golden light on the stone, which suddenly becomes a pillar and rushes to the sky. But this time, it broke through the light curtain wrapped in the wooden platform and shone directly on the dome of the emperor&rsquo;s treasure house.</p>
<p>In the treasure house, there was a mysterious and distant voice, like the mysterious Sanskrit singing in the scenic spot of Lingshan mountain and the whisper of Jiuyou lonely soul. With the golden light column against the dome, the whole treasure house of the emperor seemed to be supported by some strong force. It stopped sinking inward, and the falling of wood blocks stopped gradually.</p>
<p>Then, in the sight of Lu Xueqi and GUI Li. In the vault of the whole Tiandi treasure house, in the dazzling golden light, suddenly, the mysterious voice sounded. As for the reason of singing, the golden characters of the size of Dou appear one by one in the sky under the golden light:</p>
<p>Heaven and earth are not benevolent, and everything is the ruminant dog!</p>
<p>The body of the ghost is shocked.</p>
<p>After a while, the nine words slowly disappeared. But the mysterious singing voice is louder and louder. In an instant, the dazzling golden light suddenly bursts into all the spaces of the treasure house of the emperor of heaven. On the walls around, under the golden light, one by one, the golden characters appear in the air. The strokes are vigorous, as if they are flying.</p>
<p>Around GUI Li and Lu Xueqi.</p>
<p>In the roar, fly around!</p>
<p>GUI Li and Lu Xueqi were awed by this amazing sight, but then they were attracted by the mysterious words around them. They watched hungrily and forgot everything around them.</p>
<p>At this moment, there seems to be a voice in his heart shouting:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tianshu! Tianshu! This is the third volume of the book of heaven! &quot;</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Apart from the treasure house of the emperor of heaven, Faxiang and other people are far away from the sky. Looking at the fight between two ancient strange animals on the strange tree, their faces are involuntarily white.</p>
<p>Originally full of life. On the huge tree trunk with luxuriant branches and leaves and surrounded by numerous vines and flowers, it seems that it has been devastated once in thousands of years, with broken branches and leaves and withered flowers everywhere. It&rsquo;s a tragedy.</p>
<p>In front of the tree trunk and outside the Tiandi treasure house, the black water Xuan snake tightly coiled around the stone gate of the Tiandi treasure house. The huge snake head roared to the sky, and the god beast, the yellow bird, fluttered its wings, waving its wings every time. Even the Dharma phase and others who are watching in the distance can feel the strong wind.</p>
<p>The yellow bird has orange feathers, and its wings are more close to 100 Zhang. It has a sharp beak and sharp eyes. Its feet are also sharp and huge. At this moment, it constantly dives down and attacks the black water black snake with its sharp beak and huge claws. And the black water Xuan snake&rsquo;s mouth continuously spews out poisonous gas, the snake&rsquo;s head shakes, its tusks are sharp, it fights back with all its strength, and it sometimes hits the treasure house of the emperor of heaven.</p>
<p>The god bird and the giant snake fight with each other. It&rsquo;s dark and changeable. It&rsquo;s also good that they fight in this desolate place. Otherwise, with the strength of these two ancient strange beasts, the most prosperous place will be destroyed by them.</p>
<p>Now, the fierce black water black snake has been scarred. It used to be like a demon. The huge wounds are visible one by one. The dark red blood keeps flowing out, and the trunk under the body is dyed as the dark red color. Like it and other ancient Warcraft, originally the whole body is as hard as stone, and only like a yellow bird and other sharp claw beak, can it be hurt.</p>
<p>However, although the black water snake was seriously injured, the yellow bird itself was not so good. Originally a beautiful feather like a Phoenix, now in the fight with the black water Xuan snake, he was bitten by the black water Xuan snake for several times, and fell off countless times. There are also several wounds on his body. It can be seen that the bone and blood gush out, and the chest is dyed red nearby.</p>
<p>At this moment, the two giant beasts temporarily stopped attacking. The black water Xuan snake was perched on the treasure house of the emperor of heaven, while the yellow bird fell on the nearby tree trunk. The two sides confronted each other. The black snake roared and the yellow bird Fengming. It seemed that they were demonstrating against each other, and there was no half meaning of retreat.</p>
<p>But from the appearance, it seems that the black water black snake is in a bad situation. After all, the terrain here is not good, and it can only stand on the trunk of the tree, while the yellow bird can flutter its wings and attack from all directions, taking advantage of the advantages. In addition, the yellow bird is the natural enemy of the black water Xuan snake and other Warcraft. It is naturally resistant to the gas and venom of the black water Xuan snake. Although it is still afraid, it can&rsquo;t hurt the root or be fatal after being bitten.</p>
<p>One of the most powerful skills of the black water black snake has basically lost its effect in front of the yellow bird. In addition, the terrain is not good and the general situation is not good. It seems to realize this, and it is extremely angry. Suddenly, the snake&rsquo;s head turned, and while the yellow bird was still in the distance, it hit the treasure house of the emperor.</p>
<p>The yellow bird is furious, and in the sound of the clear roaring Phoenix, its wings rise again.</p>
<p>But this collision was gathered by the whole body strength of black water black snake, and then it went down. Not to mention, the huge tree trunk under the body was shaking violently. On the treasure house of the emperor of heaven, cracks were all over the place in a flash. Even on the huge Shimen, several cracks were hit by this collision.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, after resisting the countless impacts of the terrible power of the black water snake, now. The mysterious power in the treasure house of the emperor of heaven finally began to collapse.</p>
<p>In the distance, FA Xiang and other people looked at each other and took a breath of cool air.</p>
<p>The yellow bird shrieked. Fly to the sky, rush down, sharp beak like a huge arrow, shoot at the black water snake.</p>
<p>The sky and the sky change in a flash. It seems that there is a violent wind, forming a huge vortex. It looks like a tornado, and the yellow bird rushes down in the fierce rotating wind.</p>
<p>The black water black snake roared loudly. The huge snake&rsquo;s eyes suddenly shot out endless fierce light and fierce look. Regardless of the attack of the Yellow birds in the sky, they once again used the huge snake&rsquo;s head to hit the emperor&rsquo;s treasure house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boom!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a flash, the sand flies and the dust flies. &ldquo;Cackle cackle&rdquo; the sound of tearing resounds all over the world. Finally, after a loud noise, the dome wall of the treasure house of the emperor of heaven collapses, and is smashed away by the black water Xuan snake with incomparable strength.</p>
<p>Almost at the same time, the yellow bird stormed down, and the tornado suddenly shrouded the black water Xuan snake. People only heard that the black water Xuan snake gave out a loud roar, which was extremely bleak.</p>
<p>There seems to have been some great damage.</p>
<p>The strong wind is very strong. The Dharma phase and other people are like ants floating in the wind. They have to back up a lot.</p>
<p>When the dust is falling, the roar is not abated. When they saw it, they saw the blood running across the head of the black water black snake. The blood in the snake&rsquo;s eyes on the right was like a spring. It was a yellow bird that had blind an eye!</p>
<p>And just at this time, he was hit in the treasure house of the emperor of heaven. The golden light flickered slowly, and then gradually faded.</p>
<p>The black water snake and the yellow bird were not interested in the fight for a while, and looked down at the same time.</p>
<p>In front of these two monsters, even the huge treasure house of the emperor of heaven is like a child&rsquo;s toy.</p>
<p>In the dust, in the treasure house of the emperor of heaven, two figures stagger to stand up. It is GUI Li and Lu Xueqi. But the little ash, which had been lying on his shoulder, fell off his shoulder and hid under the wooden platform, holding the wooden pillar tightly with his hand to stabilize his body.</p>
<p>I think that under the impact of the black water Xuan snake, the situation just now in the treasure house of the emperor of heaven must not be very good. Looking at GUI Li and Lu Xueqi, although their faces were slightly pale, they were still calm, while Xiao Hui was scared of &ldquo;no monkey color&rdquo;, and his mouth was squeaking and squeaking.</p>
<p>The ghost and Li calmed down, and then the body shook. There was a big and incredible beast on both sides. The tiger looked at them, and they were all murderous. You don&rsquo;t need to think about it. It&rsquo;s not a good place.</p>
<p>But before he could respond, the wooden platform in the treasure house of the emperor of heaven and the transparent liquid in the wooden cup on the wooden platform were already seen in the remaining snake&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, the black water Xuan snake&rsquo;s eyes shot out uncontrollable greed, and the huge snake head suddenly rushed down, and the yellow bird would not stand by, with a clear roar, the sharp beak also pecked down.</p>
<p>These two giant beasts, at the same time, are powerful. No matter how high Ren GUI Li and Lu Xueqi are, they can only instinctively control the magic weapon and fly away quickly. But the spirit just flew up, suddenly a body shock, at the same time behind the &ldquo;squeak&rdquo; call, has been lying on the shoulder of the ash is now hidden under the wooden platform, did not follow up.</p>
<p>Although his temperament has changed greatly with the past, he has a deep feeling for Xiaohui. He doesn&rsquo;t want to think about it now, so he has to go back to pick up Xiaohui. Unexpectedly, when he just stopped, the yellow bird and the black water snake were all together in the sharp roar. Their wings vibrated and a gust of wind came, which pushed the ghost and Lu xueqisheng far away.</p>
<p>The spirit is very anxious, but the power of the yellow bird is so great that he can&rsquo;t help flying far away and can&rsquo;t control his body easily. He&rsquo;s afraid that he&rsquo;s not tens of feet away from the trunk. His eyebrows were wrinkled, his body was clear and bright, and he immediately flew back.</p>
<p>At the moment, the battle between the yellow bird and the black water black snake is close to the white heat. Now the black water black snake has a clear goal, which is to snatch the small cup of magic medicine. But the yellow bird naturally can&rsquo;t let it touch it, so it doesn&rsquo;t fly anymore. It stops on the tree trunk. Two giant beasts are around the small wooden cup, biting and pecking, and howling. But for a while, under the influence of the power of the other, they can&rsquo;t bow down to reach the magic medicine.</p>
<p>The little ash hid under the wooden platform and was afraid at first, but gradually found that the two big guys were fighting desperately on their own, and then they quietly looked out of their heads. But from this view, we can see that the light curtain originally shrouded around the wooden cup disappeared with the collapse of the emperor&rsquo;s treasure house.</p>
<p>Little ash slowly climbed up to the wooden platform, looked up, only to see that in the middle of the sky, the head of the snakehead reached out and pecked, fighting happily, and from time to time, huge scales and feathers fell down like rain.</p>
<p>The monkey grabbed his head and blinked. Lower his head to see his side of the wooden cup, the liquid, such as water, reflect their own appearance. One of the stones, floating on the water, doesn&rsquo;t sink. It&rsquo;s crystal clear. I don&rsquo;t know what it is.</p>
<p>He glanced at the wooden cup. Suddenly lying on the top, put his head into the wooden cup, and Gulu Gulu began to drink.</p>
<p>Gulu, Gulu, Gulu</p>
<p>The black water snake and the yellow bird, who were fighting just now, and the two monsters, who were fighting just now, were suddenly frozen.</p>
<p>Gulu, Gulu, Gulu</p>
<p>This small sound is not worth mentioning among the numerous terrible loud sounds. But I don&rsquo;t know why, all of a sudden, everything in the whole world is still, only the funny monkeys are left to drink.</p>
<p>The cup is very small, and the liquid in it is only about half a cup. The monkey soon finished drinking the ash. Then he raised his head and looked around. In the middle of the sky, the black water Xuan snake looked down and didn&rsquo;t seem to respond. He looked up as like as two peas at the opposite side of the dead, and the yellow bird looked at the little gray and looked at the black snake.</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>Tut tut.</p>
<p>Suddenly, there was another strange sound. Black water snake and yellow bird looked down at the same time.</p>
<p>However, Xiaohui sticks out his tongue and smacks twice, then the monkey head shakes. Obviously, the water in this cup doesn&rsquo;t taste very good. It&rsquo;s far worse than the delicious food cooked by his master in the kitchen of dazhufeng in Qingyun Mountain. Xiaohui is not satisfied. At this time, the monkey&rsquo;s eyes turned and he saw that the water in the cup was drunk out. But there is also a small bright stone, lying quietly in the wooden cup, and simply took it up, and then gently threw it into the air, opened his mouth, like a human eating peanuts, ah Wu, swallowed.</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>In the distance, Dharma phase people sweat together!</p>
<p>Suddenly, there was only one roar and one sharp roar. The black water Xuan snake and the yellow bird rushed down at the same time. The beak of the snake head and the bird hit the poor little monkey together. The little gray was shocked and lost color. Even the monkey hair on the head stood up in fright. But there was no escape at the moment, so they had to face down instinctively on the wooden platform and hold their heads with their hands.</p>
<p>Seeing that Xiaohui is about to die under the joint attack of the two big beasts, in this moment of urgency, a clear flash of light, it&rsquo;s the spirit and strength that makes it, reaches out to lift Xiaohui, and then flies away with all their strength.</p>
<p>As soon as they left the wooden platform, they heard the roar behind them. The whole remains of the Tiandi treasure house were destroyed</p>
<p>The black water snake roars on the trunk, but it is invincible on the land, but it has no way to deal with the flying enemy. After a long time of calling, it can&rsquo;t. In addition, the magic medicine has been lost, and there are natural enemies here. Finally, it turns angrily and slowly climbs down the huge tree, and soon disappears in the fog.</p>
<p>However, the crisis between the ghost and the ash has not disappeared. The black water black snake can&rsquo;t help it, but there are also the beast yellow birds that have been running for 80000 miles in nine days. Now they are waving their wings, and they are unwilling to give up their pursuit.</p>
<p>The yellow bird is extremely fast, but just now it has had a fierce fight with the black water black snake. It has been injured and lost a lot of physical strength. Secondly, it has a little flexibility, making a sharp turn in the mid air, which has not been overtaken by the yellow bird. But even so, the yellow bird&rsquo;s tired body is gradually catching up with it. If it can&rsquo;t fly far, it will be overtaken by the yellow bird. The little ash lying in the ghost&rsquo;s arms screams loudly. It&rsquo;s very anxious. It just barks twice, and suddenly makes a &ldquo;Er&rdquo; sound. I don&rsquo;t know whether it&rsquo;s full or what it just drank. At this time, it burps.</p>
<p>GUI Li is angry and funny. He can&rsquo;t cry or laugh, but he can&rsquo;t care so much now. He can only try to avoid the fierce wind behind him.</p>
<p>Just as he was flying, he suddenly saw a flower bed in front of him, which was different from the mess around him. The flowers were still flourishing, and there was a faint red light.</p>
<p>He was shocked. In a moment, he saw what was hidden there. Unexpectedly, they also came here, but how could they not tell themselves?</p>
<p>There was a moment of doubt in his mind, but after all, it was a life and death moment. He could not think so much. He immediately flew there and the yellow bird followed him.</p>
<p>In the distance, Lu Xueqi and other people exclaimed. Seeing the sharp claws of the yellow bird, they would catch the ghost on their back. Seeing the angry look of the yellow bird, they would not give up if they didn&rsquo;t kill those people who stole the magic medicine of the emperor of heaven!</p>
<p>As time goes by, the birds run out of energy to make green light like electricity, whizzing past the flower bed, while the Yellow birds pay no attention to the others, catch up closely, and fly to the flower bed.</p>
<p>Abrupt change.</p>
<p>Under the flowers, suddenly, the red light soared. Even above the sky, there appeared an ancient tripod, which was full of red color. It was the tripod of Fu Long, the treasure of the ghost king.</p>
<p>And a man standing on the Dragon tripod, with a calm face and a word in his mouth, is the ghost king.</p>
<p>The mysterious incantations reverberated again. At the same time, Qinglong and Youji appeared beside the flower garden, waving their hands in succession. In an instant, under the mysterious and unpredictable spiritual force of Fulong Ding, the array of &ldquo;trapped dragon Que&rdquo; was launched again. The red light swept up, connected one by one, forming a dark red light curtain, converged on the high-altitude Fulong Ding, and trapped the yellow bird in it.</p>
<p>How can the yellow bird hang on to be captured? He rushes right and left at once, but I don&rsquo;t know if he has consumed too much power after fighting with the black water Xuan snake, or if the magic power of the trapped Dragon Palace is too strong, and he bumps into the wall several times, but he can&rsquo;t rush out anyway. Instead, he is shocked by the mysterious force, and his whole body injury is more serious.</p>
<p>At last, it seemed to know that there was nothing to do. The yellow bird stopped in the red light curtain and stopped moving.</p>
<p>Ghost king a long smile, fell down, ghost Li also slowly holding small ash, fell beside him, at this moment Qinglong, Youji, also stood over.</p>
<p>The ghost Li frowned, looked at the ghost king, but the ghost King smiled a little, waved his hand and said, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll talk about it later.&rdquo; Said, he looked far away, looked at the faraway FA Xiang, Lu Xueqi and others, suddenly smiled to the ghost: &ldquo;you say, how do we deal with these people?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ghost Li body a shock, but see ghost King although smile amiable, but in the eyes, pure light flickers, there is a trace of cold inside.</p>
<p>All around, suddenly it was quiet again. (to be continued. )</p>
