      <p>There was silence all around.</p>
<p>The night is deep, and it&rsquo;s a sad time.</p>
<p>The long street is silent, and the bright moon is hanging in the sky. Under the clear light, the two people standing on the desolate street will pull out their long shadows.</p>
<p>What kind of emotions, like thousands of words entangled in the heart, just face, but can not open up.</p>
<p>Late night lonely wind, gently blowing clothes.</p>
<p>The Tianya in Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s hand is shining with a faint blue light, slowly falling down and recovering.</p>
<p>There was a sharp silence.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi looks at the man in front of her. Under the moonlight, ghost Li suddenly has a kind of breathless feeling.</p>
<p>No hands, no fighting, no bleeding, but somehow, every time he faced this beautiful woman, under her eyes, he always had inexplicable emotions.</p>
<p>Cold as snow&rsquo;s peerless face, it seems that when I first met that year, she was a tall and beautiful woman.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, once upon a time, she had her own shadow in her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That woman just now, but the gold bottle of the joy sect?&rdquo; Lu Xueqi suddenly quietly tunnel.</p>
<p>Ghost Li Zheng for a while, silently nodded, said: &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi looked at him. There seemed to be a flash of light in the bottom of his eyes. He said lightly, &ldquo;are you with her all the time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Almost subconsciously, ghost Li immediately shook his head and said: &ldquo;no, I have nothing to do with her</p>
<p>Ge. &quot; His voice suddenly turned low, and he felt a slight difference in his mood, as if to explain something.</p>
<p>But the strange light in Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s eyes has disappeared. It&rsquo;s like the pressure on her shoulder is suddenly relieved. Even her face seems to be softened.</p>
<p>However, the two people are still far away, just like a deep gap.</p>
<p>Moonlight, like water, lingers in this desolate street.</p>
<p>In the distance, the figure pursued by Jin pinger and Li Xun has disappeared. It seems that only two of them are left in the huge mountain stronghold.</p>
<p>They are sworn to be good and evil, but no matter who they are. There&rsquo;s no point in fighting at the moment. Cold and bright, Lu Xueqi suddenly said: &ldquo;you Can you accompany me? &quot;</p>
<p>Ghost Li looks up, there is a trace of surprise in his eyes.</p>
<p>Walking slowly on the deserted street, the night is deep. Moonlight is like water.</p>
<p>On both sides of the street are ruins. It&rsquo;s just that the night wind blows. It&rsquo;s far away from the mountain head of the hometown for thousands of miles. It&rsquo;s quiet, but it seems to have a touch of tenderness.</p>
<p>Two people are walking side by side.</p>
<p>However, they still left three feet away, intentionally or unintentionally, they seemed to be hiding something.</p>
<p>But in such a bleak night, how can we not let people feel entangled?</p>
<p>Light fragrance, in the wind, beside, vaguely floating.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you remember the first competition between the two of us in the seven pulse martial arts of Qingyun Mountain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi suddenly broke the silence, quietly tunnel.</p>
<p>Ghost Li body a meal, in the heart some surprised. In his impression, Lu Xueqi is not a talkative person. But somehow she seemed a little strange tonight.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, he nodded and said, &ldquo;I remember that you were able to use the magic sword to resist thunder at that time. It&rsquo;s amazing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi took a look at him and said lightly, &ldquo;but I lost the competition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he said in a low voice: &ldquo;at that time, you were far ahead of me no matter how you practiced. In fact, I&hellip;&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I lost.&rdquo; Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s face showed a trace of gloom and said softly: &ldquo;in fact, I knew at that time that you deliberately stopped at the last moment. But I don&rsquo;t know how. I couldn&rsquo;t control my aggressive heart. At that time, I couldn&rsquo;t tell the truth to the joyful master and uncle. &quot;</p>
<p>Ghost Li smiled and said, &ldquo;how can you still remember these little things after so many years?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi looks up at the bright moon in the sky. In silence. Her beauty, in the moonlight, is like a bright and light flower.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since then, I have remembered you in my mind.&rdquo; She&rsquo;s soft and quiet.</p>
<p>As soon as his body shook, he suddenly raised his head. However, he did not expect that Lu Xueqi, who was always cold, would utter such words. Just looking at the beautiful figure of that beautiful woman in the moonlight, but clearly in front of us.</p>
<p>In his heart, suddenly there was a kind of foreboding feeling, just like, quietly coming disaster, waiting quietly in front of him. He felt it, but he couldn&rsquo;t escape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Later, we went to the dead spirit abyss of kongsang mountain to fight with the people in the demon sect and fight with the ghosts and demons. You saved me regardless of your life, and I will generally treat you&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She said so softly, her voice was floating and there was a trace of unreality. It was ghostly, No. It seemed that at this moment, he once again became Zhang Xiaofan. The past years emerged in front of him.</p>
<p>Just, he can&rsquo;t say a word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At that time, we were in a desperate situation, dying struggle, but I have never been afraid. If I had died with you like that, I -&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned around and faced the man. She had never seen the brilliance in her eyes. She had never seen it. She was buried in the deep feelings of thousands of tenderness. Even between her snow like skin and cheeks, there was a faint pink and touching beauty.</p>
<p>“…… I am willing too! &quot; She said slowly, but it was as firm as breaking ice and cutting snow.</p>
<p>The night is just right!</p>
<p>The evening breeze is flying!</p>
<p>Face to face, both of them suddenly fell silent.</p>
<p>Guili&rsquo;s mind is in a mess, and thousands of thoughts and thoughts flow in his mind, but it seems that there is a voice crying out in a chaotic and turbulent tide:</p>
<p>Baguio!</p>
<p>In an instant, he was cold from head to foot, cold blood, cold heart.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi quietly looked at the man in front of him, and saw all the changes of his face and expression in his eyes. At first confused, then confused, perhaps there is a trace of panic, but all of a sudden is apathy, will be wrapped in their own strict apathy!</p>
<p>But she eyes tenderness, but never slightly reduced half, still whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Later, liuboshan, tongtianfeng, things one after another, I am on the side, watching you gradually change. At the end of the day, on the top of Tongtian peak, under the sword of Zhuxian, I know that you can never turn back after that sword is blocked by that green Yao girl. &quot;</p>
<p>There was a smile on the corner of her mouth. But it was full of bitterness and seclusion: &ldquo;you really don&rsquo;t look back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li secretly clenched his hands, and his fingernails were deeply in his hands. He breathed hard, clenched his teeth, and let his indifference not collapse.</p>
<p>Just Just</p>
<p>Just how can he face this woman coldly?</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you?&rdquo; He was in a low tunnel.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi a sad smile, eyes blurred, moonlight figure. It&rsquo;s bleak and beautiful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t regret it. Ten years ago, I still remember you in my heart. If possible, I would like to give up everything and go to the ends of the earth with you. But, after all, it is impossible! &quot;</p>
<p>She bit her lips, low, and slowly repeated, &ldquo;impossible, impossible&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, look up!</p>
<p>Her lips were as white as that. The skin on the face is pale as if to be transparent. Only her eyes are bright as the lonely moonlight hanging in the sky at the moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Qingyun gate raised me and raised me. Master loves me and teaches me. I can&rsquo;t betray Qingyun in any way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you today that you should understand my mind, and then cut off my ten years of delusion in front of you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her white hand, tightly holding Tianya, seemed to utter these words with all her strength.</p>
<p>Every word. It&rsquo;s like a sharp blade, falling on the heart of the ghost.</p>
<p>But he was silent and said nothing.</p>
<p>Deep, look!</p>
<p>This once so engraved in the deep heart of the man ah! Stand right in front of you. But it&rsquo;s like the end of the world!</p>
<p>Tianya, scabbard!</p>
<p>Flashing the blue light of the beautiful arc, flashing in the middle of the air, in front of the body, draw!</p>
<p>In the deserted street, between two people. Just one step ahead of the ghost, he made a deep crack.</p>
<p>Two people apart!</p>
<p>The moonlight is bleak, and the night is dark!</p>
<p>She is white like snow, windless but fluttering, like a fairy, in her bright eyes, all tenderness and pain are only in her deep heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Farewell tonight, and see you in the future. You and I are our enemies.&rdquo; There was no trace of blood on her pale face, and even her body began to shiver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For ten years, I have been dancing swords in the back mountain after my infatuation,&rdquo; she said quietly, &ldquo;tonight, let me dance for the last time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zheng!</p>
<p>The heaven Ya divine sword is like the sound of a Phoenix, rising to the sky for nine days.</p>
<p>A woman in white, like snow, flies up in the bleak and beautiful moonlight, like a nine day fairy who falls to the earthly world and dances madly.</p>
<p>The sword light is as quiet as a dream, dancing for thousands of years. The past years, slowly emerged, and passed.</p>
<p>Who is sighing softly, whose eyes are dim?</p>
<p>Sword light is like snow, whose heart is hurt?</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s crazy!</p>
<p>She dances alone!</p>
<p>When the wind blows, the clouds gradually open.</p>
<p>The ruins were scattered.</p>
<p>Stones go around, dust is flying, wind is bleak.</p>
<p>Her figure is floating, like floating in the wind, gathering in all directions, and the sky is dark.</p>
<p>Only left, the shadow of the quiet floating!</p>
<p>What is it that screams quietly in the heart and impulsively in the chest?</p>
<p>He can&rsquo;t, can&rsquo;t, can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trembling. Maybe I&rsquo;m going forward?</p>
<p>That step rises, be in the air, see to want to stride over the deep mark on the ground.</p>
<p>The wind is howling and the shadow is frost!</p>
<p>The sword, like autumn water, fell from the sky, breaking through the air in the sharp sound, but stopped abruptly at the tip of his brow.</p>
<p>Just now, the wind roared all over the sky, gradually calmed down, and the rolling stones slowly stopped. The sky is open again, the moonlight is bright again, and the brightness is like water.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s peerless face is right in front of his eyes, like ice and frost, only in those bright eyes, there seems to be a touch of feelings, gentle as water.</p>
<p>Their eyes fell on the middle road</p>
<p>Deep marks!</p>
<p>The coldness of Tianya divine sword seems to come from the tip of the sword across the air. It cools his body all over, making him wake up abruptly from his lost dream.</p>
<p>Her face is not human.</p>
<p>The fierce steps, stop in the air, slowly, slowly &ndash;</p>
<p>take back!</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi holds the sword&rsquo;s hand, slowly drops down, that person&rsquo;s body, finally or from this deep mark above, quietly retreated back.</p>
<p>Then she smiled</p>
<p>That smile is like a lily blooming in the night in the past life and this life!</p>
<p>But a moment later, she frowned and stooped, with a whisper, and spat out a mouthful of blood.</p>
<p>Little red, sprinkled on her white clothes, like bright and exotic flowers.</p>
<p>She still smiled, finally looked at the man, turned around, drove the sword, flew, turned into white light, crossed the night sky, disappeared in the sky under the silent bright moon.</p>
<p>Only left, a lonely man, silently looking at the street in front of him, the one dyed red</p>
<p>Deep marks!</p>
<p>In the dark, Jiuwei Tianhu Xiaobai holds Xiaohui and looks at everything happening in that street from afar. Little ash seemed to be a little uneasy and moved in her arms.</p>
<p>Xiaobai patted his head gently, stretched out his scaly white fingers and put them on his lips, making a gesture not to talk.</p>
<p>Xiaohui calmed down, but then he kept his eyes on the owner&rsquo;s bleak figure, and did not relax for a moment.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how long ghost Li stood before the deep mark on that street. He just stood and did not move.</p>
<p>And Xiaobai seems to be very patient, waiting quietly in the dark. At this moment, even Xiaobai, who is always active, becomes very quiet.</p>
<p>Finally, ghost Li&rsquo;s body moved for a while, then seemed to be very laborious general back body, turn round. From a distance, the man&rsquo;s face was as pale as death.</p>
<p>Xiaohui&rsquo;s body stirred uneasily again.</p>
<p>Far away, it seems that the ghost said something in a low voice, but no one can hear clearly. After a moment, he looked up at a loss and finally left slowly.</p>
<p>After he went far away, Xiaobai came out with the ash and came to the deep mark on the street that Lu Xueqi had made with Tianya divine sword.</p>
<p>She gazed in silence, sighing for a while.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Love in this world is heartbreaking! Pity these two men. They are so excellent, but they are like fools. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Squeak, squeak!&rdquo; Shrieking, Xiaobai is stunned, but Xiaohui, the monkey, doesn&rsquo;t want to.</p>
<p>It jumped down from Xiaobai, sat on the ground beside him, hated and didn&rsquo;t talk. It also learned how to be angry. It held its hands around its chest, and its cheeks were puffed up.</p>
<p>Xiaobai chuckled and whispered, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you like me saying your master is a fool?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohui nodded repeatedly, squeaked a few times, blinked and blinked. Although he was still angry, his long tail quietly folded back, and slightly entangled on Xiaobai&rsquo;s ankle.</p>
<p>Xiaobai smiled and shook his head, squatted down, gently stroked the monkey&rsquo;s head, and then his eyes drifted away. After a long time, he said softly: &ldquo;in fact, how can you know that my wish for thousands of years is just to be such a fool once, and then there is a fool to treat me well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that woman really wants to break the love and justice, that sword has already been stabbed down. I think at the end of the day, although she pointed at GUI Li with her sword, she didn&rsquo;t know how much she expected GUI Li to cross over regardless of everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just that if GUI Li crosses over, he will not be GUI li&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In his mind, there is a Baguio after all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaobai said in a low voice. Xiaohui didn&rsquo;t seem to understand. He grabbed his head with his hand and stared at Xiaobai blankly.</p>
<p>Xiaobai was stunned for a moment again, and then he smiled. Then he came back to his senses, reached out his hand and picked up Xiaohui. He smiled and said, &ldquo;forget it, their affairs and their knots can always be solved by himself.</p>
<p>Besides, who can say clearly about the future? &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, ash?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaobai held up Xiaohui and asked with a smile.</p>
<p>The little grey tail was shaking in the air, and &ldquo;squeaking&rdquo; called several times, shaking its head, but did not know whether it understood or not? (to be continued. )</p>
