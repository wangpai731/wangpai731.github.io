      <p>The sky gradually brightened up, and the fire which had been burning for a night in the Seven Mile cave finally subsided. It&rsquo;s just that after the flame burns, all that remains is broken walls and smoky black wood.</p>
<p>Although the Dharma is high in humanity, he has been busy for a whole night, and there are some scorched marks on his body. Some disciples of the burning incense Valley who have a slightly lower level of Taoism also have some black ashes on their faces.</p>
<p>However, when they stood still, breathed a sigh of relief, and looked around again, the eyes of ordinary Miao people towards these foreigners were full of hostility, and they did not have any good feelings for their help.</p>
<p>FA Xiang laughs bitterly. Although he feels wronged in his heart, he can&rsquo;t explain anything. Just as he wants to go back and say something to others, all of a sudden there is a commotion in the incense valley behind him.</p>
<p>FA Xiang was stunned for a moment. He turned his head and saw that shangguance fell from the sky to the ground and walked slowly.</p>
<p>He was the first to fly away last night, but it was the last one to arrive overnight. This master of incense burning Valley immediately made everyone present look at each other in awe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, hey! &ldquo;A sneer, but issued incense burning Gu Lushun&rsquo;s mouth,&rdquo; elder martial brother, you come so early! &quot;</p>
<p>Shangguan CE&rsquo;s face was expressionless, but his eyebrows were tightly wrinkled, and he could see that he was worried. He was too lazy to take care of Lv Shun. He went near and looked around. He shook his head slightly and sighed. He said to Li Xun, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s almost over here. Take your younger martial brothers back to the burning incense Valley first! &quot;</p>
<p>In fact, Li Xun was full of angry questions. He wanted to ask the martial uncle where he had gone last night. Otherwise, it would have been much easier to deal with the evil and fierce, and would not have caused so much trouble if he had the master of Shangguan&rsquo;s policy.</p>
<p>Just thinking about it, he did not dare to offend the Shangguan policy, which was second only to the leader of the valley, Yun Yilan. He agreed and said in a low voice, &ldquo;yes. &quot;</p>
<p>Lu Shun stood beside him in a rage and said to Shangguan, &ldquo;what do you mean? You didn&rsquo;t run alone last night. Will you give orders when you come here today? &quot;</p>
<p>Shangguance said faintly, &ldquo;I had an accident last night. After returning to the valley, I will talk with you in detail. &quot;</p>
<p>Lu Shun&rsquo;s face changed and he had to say something. Shangguan CE was obviously impatient. &ldquo;Old four, go back and talk about it! &quot;</p>
<p>Shangguance&rsquo;s face was not angry but powerful. When he drank this, Lu Shun did not dare to say anything more. Li Xun hesitated for a moment.</p>
<p>Finally, he said to Shangguan: &ldquo;uncle, after we go back, the Nine Tailed Tianhu &quot;</p>
<p>Shangguan shook his head and said, &ldquo;the matter of Jiuwei Tianhu is not urgent. Let&rsquo;s go back and talk about it. &quot;</p>
<p>Li Xun didn&rsquo;t dare to say anything more. He nodded and took the crowd away. Before leaving, he couldn&rsquo;t help but look back at Lu Xueqi who was standing with FA Xiang in the distance.</p>
<p>The woman in white had a cold look and didn&rsquo;t even look at him.</p>
<p>Li Xun sighed in his heart. Like turning over the bottle of Schisandra, I can&rsquo;t say the feeling, slowly go. Although Lu Shun was reluctant, he also followed.</p>
<p>Shangguan sighed and turned around. He bowed to FA Xiang and Lu Xueqi and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m really grateful for your great help to Bigu. &quot;</p>
<p>FA Xiang and Lu Xueqi didn&rsquo;t dare to be rude. FA Xiang said with a smile, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s very kind of you, uncle Shangguan. Qingyun, Tianyin and incense valley. This is a righteous family. It&rsquo;s a matter of duty to help others. It seems that martial uncle looks bad. What happened last night? &quot;</p>
<p>Said. He raised his eyes and looked at shangguance, and his mouth showed a kind smile. He was kind and peaceful, just like a Buddhist monk.</p>
<p>Shangguance snorted in his heart, but his face showed a grateful smile and said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not a big deal. I met a few thieves and wasted a little time. That&rsquo;s all. However, since things are generally good here, Bigu dares not bother you any more. Please go back to the mountain! If there is a chance in the future, I will visit the Mountain Gate with elder martial Brother Yun, the valley master. &quot;</p>
<p>FA Xiang and Lu Xueqi look at each other. Both of them are smart people. How can they believe shangguance&rsquo;s story of meeting a few thieves. The mountain bandits who can rob Shangguan&rsquo;s policy are not born yet! Even though they knew that Shangguan&rsquo;s policy had the intention of shirking, they could not expose it directly in person. They had to make a courtesy and nod their heads.</p>
<p>Shangguance said some more polite words, and then he got up and left.</p>
<p>Looking at his disappearing figure in the clouds, Lu Xueqi suddenly said, &ldquo;his mind is so heavy. &quot;</p>
<p>With a smile, FA Xiang said, &ldquo;yes! I don&rsquo;t know what he did last night In the middle of his speech, he suddenly stopped. Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s face was indifferent or indifferent, with no sense of smile. At first glance, the woman in white looked at the distance, and her eyes were complicated and hazy in her bright eyes. However, her mind was a little heavier than that of Shangguan CE.</p>
<p>What was she thinking?</p>
<p>The Dharma minister chanted the Buddha in a low voice and said nothing.</p>
<p>Mountain top.</p>
<p>Xiaobai helped GUI Li and looked at the last two alien figures in the Qili cave. They also flew to the sky and gradually disappeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re gone. &ldquo;Xiaobai said with a smile.</p>
<p>GUI Li silently withdrew his gaze at the cloud. After a moment of silence, he said, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go down! &quot;</p>
<p>Xiaobai nodded, but looked at the body and said in a soft voice, &ldquo;why don&rsquo;t we have a rest first! You&rsquo;re bleeding so much again. &quot;</p>
<p>Ghost Li shook his head and said, &ldquo;my body doesn&rsquo;t matter. It&rsquo;s important to find a great wizard. &quot;</p>
<p>Then he was the first to stand up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cheep, cheep. The familiar scream was heard nearby, and a gray shadow jumped out of the side and jumped onto the shoulder two or three times. Although the movements of the figure seemed somewhat astringent and unstable, the monkey who finally woke up from the drunkenness was obviously in a good mood and grinned.</p>
<p>Xiaobai also stood up, went to the ghost, glared at Xiao Hui angrily and said, &ldquo;what are you laughing at? Last night, you stupid master almost died, you know? &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hiss! &quot;</p>
<p>A low angry roar, but it is a small gray lying on the shoulder of the ghost, showing his teeth and looking around. The two monkeys grasp into fists and wave up and down, looking for someone to fight.</p>
<p>Xiaobai snorted and said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t pretend to be you! &quot;</p>
<p>The monkey&rsquo;s small gray eyes turned up and turned his white eyes at Xiaobai. He called twice and drew back his body. He held on to the ghost&rsquo;s lapel. He looked indifferent, but stuck to his master.</p>
<p>Ghost Li reaches out to touch its head, also did not say what. Continue to go down the mountain, Xiaohui turned his head, big is proud, to Xiaobai tongue do grimace.</p>
<p>Xiaobai smiles bitterly. Even the monkey&rsquo;s mouth is groaning and sighing &quot;</p>
<p>They went to qilidong and met the Miao people again. Everyone&rsquo;s eyes are full of resentment. Some of them saw the appearance of ghosts and fierce bloody demons last night, and their faces were even more frightened.</p>
<p>Seeing GUI Li&rsquo;s hard work, Xiaobai took a few steps to help him. When GUI Li was just about to break free, he whispered, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid these Miao people won&rsquo;t let us see the great wizard. &quot;</p>
<p>GUI Li was helped by Xiaobai. He was not used to it. He wanted to break free and walk alone, but he was stunned when he heard Xiaobai say so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? &quot;</p>
<p>Xiaobai looks forward, and the ghost follows her eyes. They are walking up the mountain where the Miao altar is located. But at the bottom of the mountain, there are dozens of strong men of Miao nationality, guarding the only access to the mountain. When they saw the two foreigners coming, almost everyone was facing a big enemy. Some soldiers had already picked up their swords and guns and pointed them at GUI Li and Xiao Bai.</p>
<p>He was silent, but his steps did not stop. He continued to walk towards the crowd. Xiaobai looked at him and said, &ldquo;what if they don&rsquo;t let us go up? &quot;</p>
<p>GUI Li didn&rsquo;t speak.</p>
<p>Lying on the shoulder of the monkey Xiao Hui is now looking around. Look between big is surprised, obviously don&rsquo;t know why oneself just sleep for a night, here become the earth shaking.</p>
<p>As soon as they got close, Xiaobai did not expect that all the Miao soldiers retreated, and they were hostile to each other. Gathered on the way to the altar on the hillside, the weapons came out of their scabbards one after another, facing the two devils.</p>
<p>The corner of his mouth twitched for a moment, and a trace of irritation flashed in his eyes. However, at this moment, he finally knew that it was not the time to force him to come. It was good to say that once the Miao people were injured, even if the great wizard was safe, he would not be able to cure Biyao for himself.</p>
<p>He took a deep breath and whispered, &ldquo;we want to see the great wizard. &quot;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I can&rsquo;t understand him or I don&rsquo;t want to pay any attention to him. The Miao soldiers didn&rsquo;t even change their faces. At the moment, even Xiaobai also frowned, big feeling thorny.</p>
<p>At this time, the voice of Tu Magu, the leader of the Miao people, came from behind the crowd: &ldquo;the great wizard is seriously injured and can&rsquo;t see visitors. You&rsquo;d better go back! &quot;</p>
<p>The crowd made way for a way, and Tu Ma Gu came out slowly from behind. His face was cold and his clothes were bloodstained. Obviously, he had a hard time last night. At the moment, his look at GUI Li Xiao Bai is quite different from that of yesterday.</p>
<p>He was silent for a moment and said, &ldquo;is the wizard OK? &quot;</p>
<p>Tu Ma Gu sneered and said, &ldquo;thanks to you, he is not dead. &quot;</p>
<p>GUI Li breathed a sigh of relief, but Xiaobai couldn&rsquo;t listen to it any more. He said faintly, &ldquo;the great wizard is injured, but we have nothing to do with it. Even if you are angry, you can&rsquo;t be angry with us.</p>
<p>&quot;</p>
<p>Tu Magu has been very angry since last night. The reason why he still talks to these two foreigners is that they didn&rsquo;t kill Miao people last night, and they saved a child. But at the moment, listening to Xiaobai&rsquo;s cold words, his anger rose and his eyebrows were about to get angry.</p>
<p>A few words came from behind the crowd, but suddenly the young wizard looked at them and said.</p>
<p>Tu Magu was obviously stunned for a moment. Some of them couldn&rsquo;t believe it. He asked in a low voice in Miao language. The young wizard nodded definitely.</p>
<p>With a long sigh, Tu Ma Gu turned around and said, &ldquo;the great wizard wants to see you. Follow this wizard up! &quot;</p>
<p>Both GUI Li and Xiao Bai are in a daze. Xiao Bai frowns and thinks how the great wizard will know that he has arrived at the foot of the mountain. However, GUI Li&rsquo;s heart is filled with joy. Since the great wizard is willing to see himself, he is probably willing to cure Biyao.</p>
<p>They followed the young wizard through the crowd and walked up the mountain. The eyes of the Miao people were puzzled and angry. But the great wizard Yu Wei was still there. No one in the audience came out to stop them. It was not long after they left that some Miao people spoke to tumagu, and many of them joined in, thinking that they did not want to see evil foreigners enter the altar again.</p>
<p>Tu Ma Gu yelled a few words, and at the same time looked at the direction of the altar on the hillside. The voices of the Miao people gradually decreased.</p>
<p>GUI Li and Xiao Bai followed the wizard who led the way to the platform in front of the altar. At the same time, they noticed that at the front of the platform, the ground was originally made of huge rocks. It cracked into innumerable slits, extending in all directions from where the great wizard stood last night, and the rock in the center became a smashed shape.</p>
<p>They looked at each other. Xiaobai&rsquo;s expression did not change, but his heart was slightly shaken. This area of Southern Xinjiang is located in the border area. It has never entered the eyes of the Xiuzhen sect in the Middle Earth. Not only the righteous school despises it, but also the demon sect. Just this time. The witchcraft in southern Xinjiang is so strange and unpredictable that it can not be underestimated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huhulu &ldquo;The wizard at the front was urging him with strange and strange Miao language, and GUI Li and Xiao Bai went back and went.</p>
<p>The altar was deep, and the darkness inside was like an endless tunnel, swallowing their figures in.</p>
<p>Far away from the south of qilidong where Miao people live in southern Xinjiang, the towering, steep and rolling mountains are the 100000 mountains that people in southern Xinjiang have heard of.</p>
<p>Here, all year round, it seems that there is no sunshine, dark clouds linger, and black wind howls. Occasionally bold hunters go hunting in the mountains in famine years. But they never came back.</p>
<p>Among the five ethnic groups in southern Xinjiang, from a long time ago, there was a warning handed down by their ancestors that they would never enter the evil mountain range, because there were the devil king that all the people in southern Xinjiang were afraid of, and the terrible barbarians under him.</p>
<p>For many years, this common commandment has been passed down from generation to generation among the five ethnic groups in southern Xinjiang. With the passing of time, the dark cloud shrouded 100000 mountains add a bit of mystery.</p>
<p>And the only access to that horrible and mysterious world. At the moment, it still exists quietly in the gloomy cave at the foot of the mountain. From time to time, there are strange shrieks, which make the teeth sour. Body chills. In the legend of Southern Xinjiang, that is the angry roar of the mysterious and terrible demon king.</p>
<p>The Lich dressed in black, like a ghost, suddenly appeared beside the cave. Although it was dawn at the moment, it seemed that darkness was still enveloped around him.</p>
<p>Behind him. Slowly appeared a huge beast, four feet on the ground, prominent claws extremely sharp. With its back and waist arched and its long and stout neck, it is a huge head. At first glance, it is almost thought that it is the dragon in the legend of the Middle Earth. After a close look, it is found that there are still differences. The beast has a large mouth and extremely sharp teeth. A pair of eyes radiate fierce light from time to time, and looks around warily, as if it wants to eat people.</p>
<p>The Lich was in front of the beast, almost a third of its height. But somehow, the dragon was very respectful to the man in black.</p>
<p>The Lich seemed to be as alert as the dragon around him. At the moment, he was also looking around carefully. After confirming that no one was following him, he turned his head and nodded to the dragon and said, &ldquo;go back! &quot;</p>
<p>There was a muffled sound in the depths of the dragon&rsquo;s throat, which might have been agreed, but it sounded as deafening as a roar.</p>
<p>The Lich was obviously used to the dragon&rsquo;s reaction. After a moment, the Lich disappeared into the cave and disappeared into the darkness. However, the dragon was too large to get into the cave. Looking at its appearance, it seemed that it was about to make a move. Suddenly, its body stopped suddenly.</p>
<p>In a huge but low roar, the ferocious dragon turned slowly.</p>
<p>It seems that something suddenly startled the sensitive dragon. At the moment, it looks ferocious and looks around again. At the same time, the nose above the mouth keeps stretching. Obviously, it has a keen sense of smell and is sniffing something in the air.</p>
<p>But there was silence around, and nothing happened, and the Dragon sniffed for a while and found nothing. The Dragon seemed confused, but after a long time, it finally decided to give up. It turned around again, yelled in a low voice and exerted its strength on all fours. In the roar, the giant beast rushed directly to the high and steep mountains.</p>
<p>It is vigorous and vigorous, with huge feet galloping. Its sharp claws are deeply grasped into the rock and soil on the mountain, and are nailed deeply like steel nails to stabilize the body. I saw it running on the ridge like flying, in a twinkling of an eye on the high mountain, gradually disappeared in a dark cloud.</p>
<p>After a long time in that gloomy cave, a long cry suddenly came out from behind a clump of flowers and plants in the distance. It seemed that they had been nervous for a long time before they relaxed.</p>
<p>A moment later, the Yellow figure of Golden Vase goose floated out of the flowers and fell outside the dark cave. Facing the dark cave, her face gradually showed a thoughtful expression. After a long time, she seemed to have made a decision. She bit her teeth and moved her figure. She also floated into the cave and sneaked into the mysterious world. (to be continued. )</p>
