      <p>&ldquo;Chen Fei?&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun blinked. Her eyes quickly swept over Chen Fei and the two people around him. After realizing their accomplishments, he was determined.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bai Xiaochun, even if you kneel down to beg for mercy, it&rsquo;s too late. At the beginning, your idea made us become disciples of other schools. I, Chen Fei, have been waiting for this day for a long time.&rdquo; Chen Fei laughs and raises his right hand. Suddenly, the cultivation of the five layers of condensation gas suddenly erupts. Many fallen leaves are lifted around, which looks quite impressive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After Chen Fei entered the outer gate, I practiced all my time, and finally arrived at the fifth floor of condensate gas. Bai Xiaochun, I told you clearly today that I wanted to bully you and break your bones and tendons!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chen Fei smiles with arrogance and complacency. He pinches the formula with his right hand. With a buzzing sound, a green flying sword appears in front of him. The sword is only half a foot in size. It looks very simple and has a faint chill.</p>
<p>The two behind Bai Xiaochun also grinned grimly. Qi Qi scattered his accomplishments, and a flying sword appeared in their hands.</p>
<p>Surrounded by these three people, they are absolutely sure that they will crush Bai Xiaochun by three dozen and one. Especially, their knowledge is not the same as before. They have already analyzed that Bai Xiaochun has not completely mastered the method of lifting heavy weights as light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t go down the mountain all the time, it&rsquo;s all right. Now that you&rsquo;ve gone down the mountain, you&rsquo;ll know how much you&rsquo;ll pay for the mistakes you made in those years.&rdquo; Chen Fei only felt a breath from his chest. At the moment, with this speech, he vomited out most of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You three stop me here, don&rsquo;t worry about the door rules?&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun looks at Chen Fei and asks curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Door gauge? Ha ha, it&rsquo;s outside the gate. Besides, you&rsquo;re not good at skills. You can&rsquo;t blame others for your broken bones and tendons. If you don&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;ll end up apologizing later! &quot; Chen Fei said with a proud smile that he could even imagine the next look of Bai Xiaochun, which must be very ugly. Even he was ready for the subsequent taunts.</p>
<p>But soon he felt something was wrong. Bai Xiaochun was too calm. In the face of her three people&rsquo;s encirclement, her face did not show the change she wanted, and even showed her strangeness. She even put on a master&rsquo;s posture and spoke with pride.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it. I&rsquo;m relieved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chen Fei&rsquo;s eyes shrunk, and he felt that something was wrong. But at the moment, he couldn&rsquo;t bear to think more about it and roared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo; As soon as the words come out, he immediately flies his sword to Bai Xiaochun. At the same time, the two people behind Bai Xiaochun also immediately pinch the Jue and dart out in front of him.</p>
<p>Seeing the three flying swords approaching Bai Xiaochun, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s face showed a smile. He didn&rsquo;t even take out the magic weapon. His body stepped back to withdraw. Chen Fei and the three felt that Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s figure had disappeared with a flower in front of them.</p>
<p>When he appeared, he was standing beside the big man on the fourth floor of condensate gas on the left side. The big man suddenly opened his eyes. Before he could react, Bai Xiaochun clenched his fist with his right hand and blew it out.</p>
<p>The blow was too fast, and it fell directly on the big man&rsquo;s stomach. With a bang, the man trembled, and a mouthful of blood gushed out, and his body arched up. If he was hit by a strong force, he suddenly flew out and hit the big tree on one side.</p>
<p>The big tree trembled a few times, and the big man&rsquo;s blood spurted out again, and he fainted directly.</p>
<p>This scene changes too fast. Another big man with four layers of gas condensate on one side looks at Bai Xiaochun in horror, and his mind is buzzing. If there are countless thunders passing by, he would never have dreamed of it. Bai Xiaochun is here It&rsquo;s so fast, but it&rsquo;s so powerful that it&rsquo;s appalling.</p>
<p>Chen Fei&rsquo;s face changes suddenly. He takes a breath backward. His body subconsciously retreats. When he looks at Bai Xiaochun, he is unbelievable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too weak.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun put on the appearance of an expert, as if he felt aloof and arrogant in the world, and could not find an opponent. With emotion, she stepped out and came to the front of another man with four layers of aura.</p>
<p>The big man let out a roar, and his whole body cultivation broke out. He urged the flying sword in front of him to go straight to Bai Xiaochun. However, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s speed was faster. After the immortal longevity skill was completed, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s body and speed were amazing. At the moment, he avoided the flying sword, and he still clenched his fist with his right hand.</p>
<p>With a bang, the big man screamed bitterly, and his blood gushed out. His body was suddenly rolled up. There was no big tree behind him. He was rolled out more than ten years ago and fell to the ground. His internal organs were shaking. He could not get up and was almost dying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too weak.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun shakes her head and looks at Chen Fei, whose legs are shaking at the moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You You&hellip; &quot; Chen Fei&rsquo;s mind is buzzing, and the whole person is almost stupid. He can&rsquo;t imagine that he still has a chance to win at the first moment, but the next moment he finds that Bai Xiaochun is like a transformation, comparable to a fierce beast.</p>
<p>The two fists made Sheng Sheng faint. It was hard for him to measure how much strength it needed. At the moment, he swallowed his saliva subconsciously and his body suddenly retreated. He could not bear the thought of fighting at all. The only thought in his mind was to escape.</p>
<p>But he didn&rsquo;t wait for him to step back. Bai Xiaochun was so fast that he caught up with him in an instant. His right hand was still a fist when his right hand was raised. At the moment of falling, Chen Fei&rsquo;s body suddenly flashed, and a small shield appeared, blocking Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s fist.</p>
<p>With a bang, Bai Xiaochun gave a slight pause. At the same time, the shield trembled and his aura was dim. He was directly hit by this blow.</p>
<p>Chen Feiwei is so scared that he spent a lot of contribution to buy this small shield. Even if it is the sixth layer of condensate gas, it can&rsquo;t be broken in a short time. However, Bai Xiaochun knocked him out of touch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bai Xiaochun, you Don&rsquo;t bully people too much! &quot; Chen Fei was shocked and made a shrill voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I can tell you clearly that today is to bully you and break your bones and tendons!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s heart was full of joy. Seeing the other party&rsquo;s fear, Bai Xiaochun never let go of this kind of comfortable thing. He not only repeated the other party&rsquo;s words, but also spread his whole body&rsquo;s cultivation. The cultivation power of six layers of condensation gas suddenly broke out, setting off a strong wind all around, and even his hair was dancing with astonishing momentum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Condensate layer 6&hellip;&rdquo; Chen Fei&rsquo;s eyes are almost bulging out, and his scalp is numb. When He staggers back, Bai Xiaochun has already caught up with him, and hits Chen Fei directly without a shield this time.</p>
<p>Chen Fei&rsquo;s whole body trembled, blood gushed out, and his body was rolled up in the scream. However, he had a strong back and a strong back, and he still had five layers of condensing gas. Instead of fainting, he tried his best to escape. At the moment, his heart was bitterly bitter, and he hated why he chose to be here, between this place and the ancestral gate There is still some distance.</p>
<p>Seeing that Bai Xiaochun comes again like a fierce beast, Chen Fei gives out a shrill voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bai Xiaochun, you are not afraid to violate the rules of the door!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Door gauge? Ha ha, it&rsquo;s outside the gate. Besides, you&rsquo;re not good at skills. You can&rsquo;t blame others for your broken bones and tendons. If you don&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;ll end up apologizing later! &quot; Bai Xiaochun coughed, repeated the other party&rsquo;s words again, and then kicked him out.</p>
<p>This kick directly kicks Chen Fei into the air. Chen Fei spurts blood again, showing despair in his eyes. Before he falls down in the scream, Bai Xiaochun has already rushed over, punching and kicking.</p>
<p>Chen Fei was afraid, and the sound of the scream continued to spread. At the end of the day, the whole person was bloated, and even the scream was gradually weak.</p>
<p>His face was pale and his bones were broken. When he looked at Bai Xiaochun, he showed a strong fear to the extreme.</p>
<p>In his view, Bai Xiaochun is a fierce beast in human skin. From the beginning to the end, Bai Xiaochun didn&rsquo;t use any magic weapon. With her strong body and amazing speed, she crushed them directly.</p>
<p>The two men, who were far away on the fourth floor of condensation gas, also woke up at the moment. Watching the scene, they felt their scalp numb and frightened. They quickly pretended to be in a coma. They did not dare to move, for fear of attracting Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s attention.</p>
<p>Seeing Chen Fei dying, Bai Xiaochun feels bored and takes his aura. In the fear of the three, he turns over their storage bags, takes away all the items, and takes away all the shields. Then he continues to hum a tune and walk along the mountain road to the ancestral gate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn it, who told me that Bai Xiaochun won Xiaobi in Xiangyun mountain by chance!&rdquo; Looking at Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s back, Chen Fei wants to cry without tears. If he had known Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s terror, he would not have come to find Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s trouble.</p>
<p>The two big men with four layers of gas condensation, with sad faces, showed strong fear when they looked at Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elder martial brother Chen, what to do If not, let&rsquo;s not mess with him and defuse it. I heard that Xu Baocai has resolved with him. &quot; They looked at Chen Fei eagerly.</p>
<p>Chen Fei is also bitter in the bottom of his heart. After a moment&rsquo;s silence, he bites his teeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naturally, I want to revenge, but what can I do if I can&rsquo;t fight back I&rsquo;ll think about it carefully&hellip; &quot;</p>
