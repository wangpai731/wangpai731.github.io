      <p>[latest broadcast] tomorrow is 515, the start of the anniversary, the most welfare day. In addition to the gift bag and schoolbag, this &ldquo;515 red envelope crazily flipping&rdquo; must see that there is no reason why the red envelope should not be robbed~</p>
<p>Du Lingfei&rsquo;s words made the outside disciples laugh. They didn&rsquo;t believe that Bai Xiaochun could be better than Du Lingfei in this aspect.</p>
<p>In particular, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s last words, to their ears, are simply impossible, which is clearly in the same blind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If this white little innocent see, then his grass and tree attainments, in the first three chapters, is enough to compare with elder martial sister Zhou Xinqi. How can this be possible?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This man is so boring that he must be exposed this time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seeing that all around them laughed at each other, Bai Xiaochun stood there and frowned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you finished?&rdquo; His face gradually cooled down, and he was really angry. If he fought, he would not be like this. But for a man who aspires to become a great pharmacist, he feels that it is a kind of shame to question the vegetation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can question my luck, you can question my magic weapon, but in this way of vegetation, don&rsquo;t look at the whole world with your shallow knowledge!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After his voice came out and his face was serious, his thin body gave people a feeling of tall and straight mountains. His cold expression made those outside disciples in this place dumbfounded in ridicule.</p>
<p>Even Du Lingfei was stunned for a moment. Bai Xiaochun at the moment was quite different from her previous appearance, as if she had changed a person.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This Lingzhi, let&rsquo;s call it black and white flower. There are gold and silver root, Tianhuang leaf, luocao, jiudiguo, whorled flesh, Yunhua, Xufeng stem and YangGuo&hellip;&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun snorted coldly and swung his sleeve. At the moment, he was no longer as cute and hateful as before. He turned his back and looked at the people around him coldly. Slowly, he seemed to have an indescribable momentum and appeared on him.</p>
<p>With the spread of his words, his momentum became stronger and stronger, and everyone around him looked surprised.</p>
<p>Du Lingfei, in particular, frowned and looked at Lingzhi carefully. She knew that all the herbs mentioned by Bai Xiaochun were recorded in the first three chapters of the plant, but she couldn&rsquo;t see any of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems that you really want to recite all the first three chapters of vegetation, so that you are more successful than me. If you can recite one by one, then you will win the game.&rdquo; Du Lingfei snorted coldly. She still didn&rsquo;t believe that Bai Xiaochun was really recognized.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, if you have the ability to recite the first three chapters of vegetation, you will win naturally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you are shallow. If you don&rsquo;t recognize it, you should admit it directly. If you don&rsquo;t recognize it, you will be looked down upon by others.&rdquo; People around him sneered and sneered.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun looks at Du Lingfei coldly, and then looks at the people. Suddenly, he smiles and takes back his eyes. He speaks faintly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A hundred grass roots, 30 years into a hundred grass, take its meridians baked, filled with Lingshui, grafted on the wild leaves, can become spots here.&rdquo; White small pure right hand a finger, a wind fell on the spirit plant, exposed a leaf under a subtle spot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaven&rsquo;s barren leaves, every nine leaves melt together, turn into a leaf, devour burning flowers and grow, it&rsquo;s here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Baizhuo flower does not become a flower under a hundred years old. When a hundred year old flower blooms, it immediately grafts a four leaf ginseng into a hundred flowers, which can nourish the barren leaves. This white flower is Baizhuo!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four leaf ginseng, with warm fire and warm roasting, wither leaves and essence into the ginseng, can promote the development and integration of flat seed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And pingbeizi&hellip;&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s voice was calm. Every word he said would sweep the wind. He found the traces of grafting on the spiritual plant. He said it very carefully. Even the method was said. People around him began to look ironic, but gradually the ridicule disappeared. One by one, their faces changed one after another. Then he breathed quickly and changed greatly. At the end of the day, every other disciple of the outside school, unexpectedly They all look incredible. In particular, a few more people were directly shocked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s impossible!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God, how could it be so!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Every word of Bai Xiaochun echoed like an invisible slap, which directly hit these people. All the people here were medicine children. Before they could not see the secret of the spirit plant, but now in such a detailed introduction of Bai Xiaochun, they all recognized them immediately.</p>
<p>What Bai Xiaochun said was absolutely right and correct. He was a man who slapped all the other disciples here!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s accomplishments in grass and trees are incredibly To such an amazing degree Those outside disciples&rsquo; mind has already roared, before the ridicule, now became the hot tingling on the face.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, it&rsquo;s Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s method of introduction, which is clearly the reverse deduction. From a grafted spiritual plant, it directly introduces the grafting method. This reverse deduction requires a person&rsquo;s attainments in plants and trees to an incredible degree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This It&rsquo;s a reversal. He His understanding of plants has reached such a level&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a medicine boy, to deduce the spirit plant cultivated by palm base, this This&hellip; &quot; Elder sun also opened his eyes, with incredible.</p>
<p>Li Qinghou eyes showed a strong light, this moment of Bai Xiaochun, let him also feel incredible.</p>
<p>Du Lingfei&rsquo;s face was momentarily pale, and her body staggered back. With her accomplishments in vegetation, she immediately realized what Bai Xiaochun said. She even felt a trance for many times, which made her extremely embarrassed.</p>
<p>At the moment, Bai Xiaochun didn&rsquo;t use any skills, but with the words he said and his understanding of the plants, the words were like magic weapons, which made Du Lingfei unable to resist. He only felt that his mind roared. If there was thunder, he would step back again and again, and his face would be more and more pale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fire Pinellia ternata, nine hot days, so that the spirit bead sun between heaven and earth and not die, into the Pinellia fruit, produce blackhead flower! This is the last spirit grass I can see After half a column of incense, Bai Xiaochun finished the last sentence. His eyes were like electricity. After sweeping around the crowd, he looked at Du Lingfei.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elder martial sister Du, you all belong to the same family. The way of vegetation is broad and profound, and there is no absolute. Otherwise, your achievements in vegetation will stop here. Since you ask me to recite all the first three chapters of vegetation, how difficult is it?&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun raised his chin and swung his sleeve. He stood there reciting one by one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lingdong bamboo&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dilongguo&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ink roots&hellip;&rdquo; He opened his mouth with a calm look. As he recited, it was relatively quiet. Only Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s voice reverberated. It seemed that after hitting everyone with one slap, he swung his hand and fanned out the second slap again.</p>
<p>Gradually, even if the people around them had no face to see people, they could not help but breathe in again. Even immediately, someone took out some plants and jade slips and compared them. Slowly, those people who compared with each other were shaking their bodies and their eyes were more intense.</p>
<p>Du Lingfei&rsquo;s face became more and more pale, and her body retreated again. When she looked at Bai Xiaochun, she was like seeing a ghost.</p>
<p>In fact, she had never seen anyone recite 30000 kinds of herbs in such a way. In her opinion, this kind of thing is inconceivable to her. If someone can do it, then this person&rsquo;s attainments in vegetation will be against the heaven.</p>
<p>As time went by, Bai Xiaochun recited it so fast that he recited an hour at a time. For people here, they did not know how to spend the time. Almost all of them took out jade slips to compare with each other.</p>
<p>An hour later, when Bai Xiaochun finished the last herb, the people in this place broke out a shocking noise after the death like silence, and even spread all around, which was heard by many outside disciples outside the square.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God One is right, all right, this There is such a thing</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thirty thousand herbs Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s attainments in vegetation are so amazing that he What&rsquo;s his ranking in the stone tablet of plants and trees? &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To compare Du Lingfei with Bai Xiaochun in the attainments of plants and plants, this is to hit a stone with an egg!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In these four weeks, Du Lingfei looks at Bai Xiaochun, and her heart is full of bitterness. Even in the previous fight, she has never been like this. But now, in terms of her accomplishments in vegetation, it can be said that she has been completely crushed.</p>
<p>She had no idea that Bai Xiaochun, who was lucky and had many magic weapons, was so lucky that she could not see clearly her accomplishments in vegetation.</p>
<p>This kind of attack made her laugh bitterly, threw Ling Yunxiang, turned around and left quickly. She felt embarrassed that she didn&rsquo;t stay here any more.</p>
<p>As soon as Du Lingfei left, all the other disciples around him were embarrassed. Most of them clasped their fists toward Bai Xiaochun and left quickly. It can be imagined that the shock in their hearts will last for a long time.</p>
<p>Soon, in the martial arts arena, all the disciples had left, leaving Bai Xiaochun standing there. He coughed and felt that he had been Some make things big, quickly pick up Ling Yunxiang, and look back carefully at Li Qinghou.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Disciple Go first. &quot;</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun said, quickly back, a slip of smoke ran no shadow.</p>
<p>In the martial arts arena, elder sun looked at Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s back, leaving a shock in his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Palm seat, this son Extraordinary Elder sun spoke softly.</p>
<p>Li Qinghou laughs, laughs with a big sleeve and goes to the top of the mountain.</p>
