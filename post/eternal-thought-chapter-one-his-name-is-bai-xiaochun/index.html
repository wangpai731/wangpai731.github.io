      <p>Maoershan is located in the Donglin mountains. There is a village at the foot of the mountain. The people are simple and live on farming. They are isolated from the world.</p>
<p>In the early morning, in front of the gate of the village, the villagers in the whole village were seeing off a 15-year-old boy. The young man was thin, but white, and looked very clever. Although his clothes were ordinary blue clothes, they were washed white. They were put on the young man and matched with the purity in his eyes, which gave him a smart feeling.</p>
<p>His name is Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father, fellow villagers, I&rsquo;m going to cultivate immortals, but I can&rsquo;t bear you.&rdquo; Young face not give up, originally clever appearance, now looks more simple.</p>
<p>Around the villagers, looking at each other, immediately put out a reluctant color.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Xiaochun, your parents left early. You are a Good boy!! Don&rsquo;t you want to live forever? If you become an immortal, you can live for a long time. Let&rsquo;s go. When the young eagles grow up, they will fly out Out of the crowd came an old man with gray hair. He stopped for a moment when he said &ldquo;good boy&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you encounter anything outside, you should stick to it. If you go out of the village, don&rsquo;t come back, because your road is ahead!&rdquo; The old man looked kind and patted the boy on the shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Longevity&hellip;&rdquo; With the encouragement of the old man and the villagers around him, he nodded heavily, took a deep look at the villagers around him, turned around and took a big step, and gradually walked out of the village.</p>
<p>Seeing the youth&rsquo;s figure far away, all the people in the village were excited. The sadness in the eyes was replaced by joy. The old man with a kind face was shaking at the moment, and tears were flowing from his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaven has eyes, this white rat wolf, he finally Finally, who told him to see the immortal nearby? You have made great contributions to the village! &ldquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The white rat wolf finally agreed to leave. He pitied my chickens. Because the white wolf was afraid of the crowing of chickens, he did not know what method he used to instigate a group of children to eat chicken and eat all the chickens in the village.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Spring Festival today!&rdquo; The sound of cheering, immediately in this small village, boiling up, and even someone took out gongs and drums, happy to beat up.</p>
<p>Outside the village, Bai Xiaochun did not wait to go far away when he heard the sound of gongs and drums and cheers from the village behind him.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun steps a meal, look a little strange, dry cough, accompanied by the ears of gongs and drums, Bai Xiaochun along the mountain road, walked up the Maoershan.</p>
<p>Although Mao&rsquo;er Mountain is not high, there are many shrubs. Although it is early in the morning, it looks dark and quiet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two dogs said that when he was chased by a wild boar a few days ago, he saw a fairy fly by&hellip;&rdquo; When Bai Xiaochun was walking on the mountain road, his heart was pounding. Suddenly, there were bursts of noise in the forest beside him, like a wild boar. The sudden sound made Bai Xiaochun, who was already nervous, suddenly felt cold behind his back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who, who is there!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s right hand quickly took out four axes and six wood knives from his luggage bag. He still felt uneasy. He took out a small black incense from his arms and grasped it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t come out. Don&rsquo;t come out. I have an axe and a wood knife. The incense in my hand can also summon thunder. If you dare to come out, you will die!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun screamed with trembling arms, and ran down the mountain road with those weapons in his hands. Along the way, he jingled and fell all over the ground.</p>
<p>Maybe he was really scared by him, and soon the sound disappeared. There were no wild animals running out. Bai Xiaochun was pale, wiped his cold sweat, and wanted to give up going up the mountain. But when he thought that the incense in his hand was left by his parents before his parents died, it is said that his ancestors had accidentally saved a fallen immortal. When the immortal left, he left this incense as a reward and once said that he would take it Bai&rsquo;s blood is a disciple. As long as you light it, the immortal will come.</p>
<p>But so far, he has ordered the incense more than ten times, but he has never seen the immortal come. Bai Xiaochun begins to doubt whether the immortal will come. This time, he made up his mind because there is not much left in the incense. On the other hand, he heard from the villagers that he saw some immortals flying from the sky in the first few days here.</p>
<p>So he came, thinking that he was closer to the immortal, maybe the immortal would have noticed it.</p>
<p>After a while, he looked down at the top of the mountain, and felt that he was still standing at the top of the mountain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For three years, my parents have blessed me, and I must succeed this time!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun took a deep breath and ignited the incense carefully. Immediately, the strong wind was blowing around. The sky was even more cloudy in the blink of an eye. Lightning flashed through the sky, and deafening thunder exploded directly in Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s ear.</p>
<p>The loud voice and powerful momentum made Bai Xiaochun shiver. He felt that he would be killed by thunder at any time. Subconsciously, he wanted to spit out the incense, but he struggled to resist it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For three years, I have ordered this incense twelve times. This is the thirteenth time. I must hold back this time. Xiaochun is not afraid. I should not be chopped to death&hellip;&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun remembered the experience of the past three years. Not counting this time, he ordered it 12 times. Every time, it was like thunder and lightning. The immortal didn&rsquo;t come. He was scared to death. He spit to put it out every time. Strange to say, this incense looks extraordinary, but in fact, it is just like pouring water to extinguish it.</p>
<p>In Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s panic, hard to wait in the thunder, not far from here in the sky, there is a long rainbow is rapidly roaring.</p>
<p>Changhong is a middle-aged man, this man is gorgeous, immoral, but it is dusty, even if you look carefully, you can see the deep fatigue in his look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to see what kind of person he is. He has ordered a root fragrance for three years!&rdquo;.</p>
<p>At the thought of his experience in the past three years, the middle-aged man became angry. Three years ago, he noticed that someone had ignited the incense sent out when he was still condensing gas. He remembered a section of human relationship in the ordinary world at that time.</p>
<p>This just flies out to seek, originally according to his plan, will come back soon, but did not think, just looking for the fragrance in the past, has not yet waited far, that breath disappears instantly, broke the contact. If it is only once, the breath has appeared more than ten times in the past three years.</p>
<p>So he stopped looking for it many times, and he went back and forth for three years.</p>
<p>At this moment, he saw Mao&rsquo;er Mountain and Bai Xiaochun on the top of the mountain. He didn&rsquo;t feel angry and flew out in a flash. He stood on the top of the mountain directly with a wave of his big hand. With a wave of his big hand, the little remaining incense went out directly.</p>
<p>Thunder disappeared in a flash, white Xiaochun Leng for a moment, looked up, saw his side more than a middle-aged man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fairy?&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun carefully opened his mouth, some uncertain, secretly picked up an ax from behind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Li Qinghou, are you a descendant of the white family?&rdquo; The middle-aged monk&rsquo;s eyes were like electricity, ignoring the axe behind Bai Xiaochun. He looked at Bai Xiaochun for a while. He felt that he had a beautiful face and was vaguely similar to his old friend in those years. His aptitude was also good. His anger at the bottom of his heart could not help slowing down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The younger generation is the descendant of Bai family, Bai Xiaochun.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun blinked and whispered. Although she was afraid, she still stood up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ask you, why have you ordered a incense for three years?&rdquo; The middle-aged monk asked him what he wanted to know most in the past three years.</p>
<p>When Bai Xiaochun heard this question, his brain turned rapidly, and then he looked melancholy on his face and looked at the village at the foot of the mountain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The younger generation is a person who attaches great importance to love and righteousness. They are reluctant to leave the villagers every time I light incense. Now they are still sad because of my leaving.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The middle-aged monk was stunned. The reason was that he had never thought of it before. The anger in his eyes was less. From the perspective of words, this son&rsquo;s nature is still good.</p>
<p>In fact, when he saw the sound of the village, some of the wolf&rsquo;s eyes were hard to recognize.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell the truth!&rdquo; The middle-aged monk glared, his voice was like thunder, and Bai Xiaochun was scared to shiver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not my fault. Your broken incense always thunders every time it&rsquo;s ignited. It almost kills me several times. It&rsquo;s hard for me to escape 13 times.&rdquo; Said Bai Xiaochun pitifully.</p>
<p>The middle-aged monk looked at Bai Xiaochun for a long time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you are so afraid, why do you have to force yourself to order incense more than ten times?&rdquo; The middle-aged monk spoke slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid of death. I can&rsquo;t live forever. I want to live forever.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun said wrongly.</p>
<p>The middle-aged monk was speechless again. However, he felt that this son could be praised for his obsession. He could be put into the sect to practice, or change his temperament.</p>
<p>So a little thought, a big sleeve a roll, white small pure into a rainbow, straight to the horizon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come with me.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you going? It&rsquo;s too high&hellip; &quot; Bai Xiaochun saw that he was flying in the sky, and the abyss was below. He immediately turned pale and threw his axe around the immortal&rsquo;s thigh.</p>
<p>The middle-aged monk looked at his leg, but could not speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lingxizong.&rdquo;.</p>
