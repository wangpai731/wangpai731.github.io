      <p>&ldquo;Master, what&rsquo;s wrong with you? What happened&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu rushes to Wan Jianyi&rsquo;s side and kneels down. His hands are shaking and he wants to help him up. However, the place where he starts is soft, and a cold comes from his heart. Lin Jingyu seems to be in a bottomless ice cellar. Where he touches his hands, there is no bone in the old man that is complete.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is it? Who is it?&rdquo; Lin Jingyu&rsquo;s voice became hoarse in an instant. His teeth bit his lips deeply and his eyes burst into anger and despair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master, master&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He cried in a low voice, choked, and finally cried. He never knew that he would cry. Just in front of the old man, the despair of more than ten years ago seemed to envelop him again.</p>
<p>Wan Jian looks at the young man powerlessly. He is so sad and desperate that he can&rsquo;t be hypocritical. Maybe, in the end, someone really cares about me. Wan Jian thinks so in his heart.</p>
<p>His fingers moved, and then, as if he had been pitied by the gods, he raised his hand tremblingly.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu was shocked. He grabbed his hand and said in a hurry: &ldquo;master, master, do you have anything to say? Who did you harm? I will revenge you. Who is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wan Jian Yi&rsquo;s face became more and more pale, and even his breath was slowly lowered. But somehow, his eyes were more bright. He held the palm of Lin Jingyu&rsquo;s hand, and his fingers swayed gently</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu was stunned for a moment. He looked down. In the palm of his hand, the old and powerless finger was stained with blood. He sketched the strokes lightly and scribbled: &ldquo;little Heart&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>All of a sudden, behind Lin Jingyu, in the mist, a dark shadow flashed out, and Mr. ghost was staring at this side. Lin Jingyu is now facing Mr. ghost. Moreover, he was absorbed in Wan Jianyi&rsquo;s finger, and did not feel it at all. But wan Jian saw it. His eyes and Mr. ghost&rsquo;s eyes touched each other soundlessly in the air, as if it had been a hundred years.</p>
<p>The vicissitudes of the past</p>
<p>Wan Jianyi suddenly smiles. With a smile of blood, to Mr. ghost, and then, he shook his head.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu waited for a long time, but he didn&rsquo;t see Wan Jian continuing to write. He looked up in astonishment, but he saw that Wan Jian bent to one side, and he was out of breath.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu&rsquo;s body was shaken and his hands were shaking. He looked at his lifeless face in disbelief. After a while, he cried out, &ldquo;master&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cry of pain came from his throwing himself at the old man.</p>
<p>Mr. ghost stood quietly behind him, staring at Wan Jian&rsquo;s old face. After a long time. Quietly back, disappeared in the mist, far away in the wind, came a faint sigh.</p>
<p>At the foot of the mountain, the wolf howled, and the shrill and ferocious roar rang out from afar.</p>
<p>At the top of Qingyun Mountain, people in the right way gather on Tongtian peak. The people standing in the front, such as daoxuan immortal, Pu Hong Shangren and Yun Yilan, all have heavy faces. Frowning, looking at the direction of Qingyun Mountain.</p>
<p>The faint fishy smell can be faintly smelled in the wind, which makes people can&rsquo;t help but think of the countless cruel and ferocious monsters at the foot of the mountain. Nobody knows. What will happen after this catastrophe?</p>
<p>On the square outside the Yuqing hall, the people&rsquo;s heads were shaking, but it was quiet. Everyone was dignified.</p>
<p>In this silent moment, suddenly. In the distance, there was a roar rising from the sky, like a wolf howling, like a ghost crying, piercing through the air, forced from afar.</p>
<p>Listening to the sound of the place, seems to be still under the foot of the mountain, but whistling into the clouds, for a time everyone changed color. The whistling sound curled and reverberated, turning a few times between the perilous peaks of the white clouds, and then slowly lowered. But at the moment when it can be stopped, at the foot of the mountain, thousands of animals roared together, and the countless roars rose to the sky and gathered together like a mountain and a sea, until the sky and the earth changed color and rumbled.</p>
<p>The clouds suddenly dispersed, and the mountain stopped steeply. A cloud of black gas rose from the foot of the mountain. It grew bigger and denser, and condensed in the sky opposite the Tongtian peak until it blocked the sunlight. Black clouds, gradually floating in this fairyland general place.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know who was the first one to shout out. All the people on the top of the mountain looked at them with sharp eyes. Deep in the dark clouds and in the hunting wind, a young man in a conspicuous silk dress stood with his hands on his hands, and his face was expressionless, staring at the people of the mountain indifferently.</p>
<p>What kind of things are people in the eyes of heaven and earth?</p>
<p>He waved his hand gently, but his eyes seemed to cross the mountain.</p>
<p>At the foot of the mountain, beasts roar, the wind bursts, and the voice of sorrow finally comes</p>
<p>As if feeling something, he stopped for a moment, frowned slightly, turned around and looked at the front mountain of Tongtian peak. He saw that the sky was dark and the wind was howling. Although it was not far away, it was totally different from the back mountain where I was.</p>
<p>Warm sunlight, falling from the sky, is falling on his lapel.</p>
<p>GUI Li slowly withdrew his eyes and subconsciously looked at his shoulder, but he didn&rsquo;t see the small ash. This time, when he entered the magic moon cave, he did not bring little ash with him. The danger was self-evident and he was not sure. In the battle with the mysterious old man just now, although Mr. ghost helped, GUI Li had an indescribable feeling towards the old man. With thousands of years of history, Qingyun gate is indeed a place where dragons and tigers are hidden.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, I was not a part of here?</p>
<p>He closed his mouth indifferently and stepped forward again.</p>
<p>On both sides of the path as before, there are thick woods everywhere, evergreen pines and cypresses, dense vegetation, only this mountain path twists and turns forward, leading to the mystery of the unknown.</p>
<p>Deep in the woods, there is still a faint chirp of birds. It seems that the scene of catastrophe in the front of the mountain has no impact on the place separated by the mountain. There is a breath of calm everywhere, even in the air, there is a cold smell.</p>
<p>In such a quiet environment, GUI Li was so nervous that when he looked up for the first time and saw the four words &ldquo;magic moon cave&rdquo;, he did not have a trace of strange expression on his face when facing the world-famous territory. It was like seeing an ordinary cave.</p>
<p>In fact, in front of him, it seems that it is just an ordinary cave.</p>
<p>The hole, half higher than the average person, is about seven feet wide. It appears on a gentle hillside, surrounded by green vines and brambles, and even a few branches drop down the hole. The mountain wind is blowing, and the vines are shaking gently. Just under the green vine, the stone above the hole was engraved with four words:</p>
<p>Magic moon cave.</p>
<p>In addition to the meaning of these four words, everything around them even includes these handwriting.</p>
<p>It seems so common. Is this the foundation of Qingyun gate for two thousand years?</p>
<p>That volume has created countless talents and heroes, including qingyunzi and the founder of Qingye. Is that the nameless ancient scroll lying here quietly?</p>
<p>And the famous ancient sword!</p>
<p>Looking at those four words quietly. After years of wind and frost, the handwriting seems to be staring at him in silence.</p>
<p>He did not speak, did not sigh, the next moment, he stepped in, as if, stepping into the past</p>
<p>There is no deep and long in the imagination, what appears in front of you is just a simple stone chamber. You can see all the furnishings in the cave at a glance. A few stones piled in the corner of the wall, the corner of the wall slightly wet place has a faint moss, the only difference with the outside of the cave is. It&rsquo;s very quiet here. When I walk into the cave, everything seems to be quiet and isolated from the outside.</p>
<p>He withdrew his eyes from the surrounding area, and finally fell on the stone wall facing the entrance of the cave. The flat stone wall is inlaid with a stone slab Tai Chi pattern, which is the only thing in this cave that can be related to Qingyun gate.</p>
<p>GUI Li inhaled deeply, went up and stopped in front of the Tai Chi pattern. There are many signs of damage on the Taiji diagram. It&rsquo;s obviously a thing of old age. GUI Li looks at this thing in silence, and the words that Mr. ghost said not long ago reverberated in his mind.</p>
<p>The next moment, he gently put his hand on the Tai Chi pattern, light blue light. From between his palms. He looked at the light in his hand without expression and felt the familiar breath of Taiji Xuanqing road flowing from his body meridians. It was the breath that he belonged to this mountain range!</p>
<p>It seems that the person who has been sleeping for a long time finally wakes up. The calm in the stone chamber is suddenly broken by a distant light sound, just like a sigh of the whole cave. Something starts to turn. Then, the Taiji diagram also lit up a blue light, at the same time, the Taiji pattern began to rotate.</p>
<p>Just a week after turning left to right, there was a &ldquo;card&rdquo; sound in the stone wall, and everything stopped. He took back his arm and waited quietly.</p>
<p>A moment of silence disappeared, and a dull and rumbling sound was heard in the cave. On the right side of the Tai Chi pattern, a ring shaped crack suddenly appeared in the original intact stone wall, and then slowly rotated to the side, revealing a secret hole.</p>
<p>However, there is a strange thing in the shape of gray water mist circling around the hole. It looks like fog and water wave in the past. It is not clear inside, and it is not true at all.</p>
<p>Looking at the mist, Mr. ghost didn&rsquo;t cheat him after all. But in this mysterious mist, who knows what it is?</p>
<p>He did not hesitate, or even did not seem to think much of the appearance, stride into.</p>
<p>Water mist engulfed him, the figure quickly disappeared, and the two stone walls this time is quietly turned back, gently closed, no trace.</p>
<p>In a trance, hazy, deep in the sky, there was a flash of lightning, which suddenly pierced the darkness of the long night. It turned into a huge lightsaber from the sky. It was so dazzling that people could not face it directly and pierced into the deep heart.</p>
<p>Then, in the dark sky, a strange moon with strange silver light rose, hanging in the far sky.</p>
<p>At that moment, there was a blank in my mind, and I forgot everything. Only my eyes were still staring forward, behind the white light.</p>
<p>It seems to be a deep and sad voice. Some people are crying, but then a familiar voice laughs, and a young voice &ldquo;wow&rdquo; finally starts to cry.</p>
<p>Somehow, he held his breath!</p>
<p>Inexplicably nervous, but the heartbeat is so fast, as if there is wind in the ear, but can not feel their own existence, as if only a pair of eyes in the exploration, look around, finally see</p>
<p>That small village, there is a dilapidated grass Temple behind the village.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it born?&rdquo; A man&rsquo;s voice asked anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! Mother and son are safe. It&rsquo;s a boy. &quot; With a smile in her voice, she said aloud, &ldquo;Congratulations!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hehe, hehe&hellip;&rdquo; Honest man with a simple smile, simple feelings with some comfort and some happiness. The next moment, he saw the crying boy, the child nestled in the arms of his parents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the name? His father! &quot; My mother was a little weak, but she still had a happy smile on her face.</p>
<p>The father thought for a while and said, &ldquo;we all don&rsquo;t recognize one of them. If I say that the most learned person in the village is Mr. Lin, who teaches at the east end of the village. There are children in the village. Don&rsquo;t he take all the names, why don&rsquo;t we ask him to take one? &quot;</p>
<p>Mother nodded. And father went out.</p>
<p>After a while, he came in from outside with a smile on his face and a note, saying, &ldquo;Mr. Lin said so. For a family like us, the most important thing is to keep our duty and live a good life, so he took three words and wrote them on it. &quot;</p>
<p>The mother said happily, &ldquo;Oh, the learned people are different. What name did he give our son?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The father took the note to his mother with his rough hand. He held the mother and the sleeping child in his arm. He lowered his voice, as if he had great respect and love for these three words. Quietly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zhang, Xiao, fan&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boom!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a thunder in the sky, and it rained in the sky. He suddenly trembled and gasped hard!</p>
<p>There is rain outside the house, the sky is like ink, the distant Qingyun Mountain is ferocious, and in the miserable wind and rain on the ground, father and mother embrace each other. With a smile on their faces</p>
<p>He wanted to shout, but he couldn&rsquo;t make a sound. Thousands of words echoed in his mind, but he only changed into two words</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father and mother!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was raining all over the sky. It seemed to fall on his face, freezing to the bone.</p>
<p>The moon in the sky is shining with a faint light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bang!&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the sky flew a stone, like through the body, fell behind, the sky did not know when it became clear, there are a group of children running in the village. Loud laughter and play.</p>
<p>The ordinary boy was running hard in front of him. A boy older than him was chasing behind with a group of children. He also called out: &ldquo;Zhang Xiaofan, if you have seed, stop!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The child in front of him said, &ldquo;bah!&rdquo; as he ran, he said, &ldquo;you should be an idiot.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s faster.</p>
<p>Along the way, these children gradually ran close to the old grass Temple in the east of the village. From the outside, this small grass Temple is dilapidated, and I don&rsquo;t know how many storms it has experienced.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was the first to rush in, and the group of children behind him also ran in. In that dilapidated grass Temple, it seemed that there were children&rsquo;s voices coming out.</p>
<p>He looked at it in a daze, and suddenly there was a blank in his mind. It seemed that there was a trace of inexplicable fear, which came out of the place which had been forgotten in his deep heart, and filled the whole heart.</p>
<p>Step by step, he approached the grass Temple quietly, approaching the nightmare that seemed to have disappeared a long time ago.</p>
<p>The older and more beautiful boy rode on Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s body with a proud face and said with a smile, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve caught you. Now you have nothing to say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s strange eyes rolled and said, &ldquo;if you don&rsquo;t count, you&rsquo;ve plotted against me. How can you do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy was stunned and said, &ldquo;when did I plot against you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan said, &ldquo;well, Lin Jingyu, do you dare to say that you didn&rsquo;t put this door here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The child called Lin Jingyu said in a loud voice, &ldquo;how can this happen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan sipped his mouth and tilted his head. He was determined not to surrender or surrender.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu gasped from his heart and grabbed his neck with one hand. He said angrily, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;re ready to seize it, you&rsquo;ll admit defeat. Can&rsquo;t you accept it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan ignored it.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu&rsquo;s face turned red and his hands were hard. He said in a loud voice, &ldquo;can&rsquo;t you accept it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s windpipe was choked by him, and his breathing became difficult gradually. His face began to turn red. However, he was very strong at a young age, and he was silent.</p>
<p>However, Lin Jingyu became more and more angry, and his hands became more and more powerful. In his mouth, he said in a voice: &ldquo;do you want to accept, do not accept, do not accept?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not satisfied with Not satisfied with The voice suddenly reverberated in his mind like a mountain and a sea, and his heartache for many years came to his mind in a stack of voices.</p>
<p>Then, as if once expected, but also as if unprepared - that hand quietly stretched out from the years, withered and full of wrinkles, so familiar, so kind, but once upon a time, it was so shocking, with boundless hate!</p>
<p>The old monk, smiling, is still once kind smile, standing in front of. In a moment, his world was completely blank, and all the other things, villages, children, disputes, suddenly disappeared. Only the compassionate and peaceful old monk looked at himself with a smile, like a picture that never faded in the secluded years.</p>
<p>His whole body trembled, and an inexpressible grief and indignation surged into his heart, and he could not help but roar up to the sky.</p>
<p>When does the sky turn black again?</p>
<p>Wind and rain, quietly fall! (to be continued. )</p>
