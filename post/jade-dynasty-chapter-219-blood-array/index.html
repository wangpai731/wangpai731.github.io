      <p>Huqishan, the general Hall of ghost king.</p>
<p>Along the way, he only felt a blank in his mind. Only the mysterious and fuzzy figure of a woman lingered in front of him. However, he clearly knew that it should be an illusion, right?</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>In a daze, he found that he did not know when he had gone back to his stone room. The stone door was open. When you look in from the door, you can still see the chaos inside. It is just the result of his inexplicable fighting with the ghost king just now.</p>
<p>He looked at the mess for a long time. He walked in slowly, found a chair that was still in good condition by the broken table, and sat down in a daze.</p>
<p>Monkey Xiaohui ran from the side, it seems that he is still depressed. Without saying a word, he climbed up the ghostly shoulder and sat down. Then he was stunned.</p>
<p>Maybe it is still worried about Taotie!</p>
<p>One man and one monkey sat like this for a long time. There was no sound at all. The whole stone chamber looked very dull. At last, he suddenly moved his body, and then stretched out his hand to pull the ash down from his shoulder and lift it to the front of his body.</p>
<p>Xiao Hui&rsquo;s three eyes blinked at the same time, looking at the ghost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Xiao Hui, what do you think I should do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Monkey Xiaohui said nothing, just looked at him.</p>
<p>GUI Li didn&rsquo;t seem to care about his answer, but he murmured to himself, &ldquo;how should I go this way&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know the years in the mountains, and time passes like water.</p>
<p>In the deepest secret place in the hinterland of Huqi mountain, in the huge blood pool, there is a strong smell of blood. This strange existence quietly hides in the forgotten corner known by the world and sprouts quietly.</p>
<p>Naturally, except for two people, ghost king and ghost Mr.</p>
<p>The huge blood pool is still full of crimson blood, and countless bubbles are rising from the depth of the blood pool from time to time. On the surface of the water, it sprang up and burst, splashing a little blood.</p>
<p>As before, the huge spirit animal body was imprisoned in the blood. In addition to Kui Niu and huangniao, there are two more figures in the blood pool at this moment. One is the ferocious beast who is struggling but can&rsquo;t do anything about it, and the other figure.</p>
<p>It is a monster with a huge body. Its head is like the legendary dragon. Its body is almost a circle larger than Kui Niu. Because most of it is covered in blood and water, the specific shape can not be seen clearly. However, from several parts of the body protruding from the water, it can be imagined that it must be the &ldquo;candle dragon&rdquo; in the legend of the magic cult.</p>
<p>Kui Niu and huangniao have been imprisoned for a long time. They are dying. They can&rsquo;t lift their spirits. The candle dragon is also in a state of collapse. There was no life except Taotie. Because he had just caught him, his mental strength was still in good condition. From time to time, he let out angry roars, which aroused waves of blood around him. Obviously, he was extremely angry.</p>
<p>However, there seems to be a strange force in this blood pool, which not only imprisons the other three beasts, but also can&rsquo;t get rid of the gluttonous, roaring and struggling empty. Nothing, after all. In addition, in the sky above the blood pool, more than before, there was another vision.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a mysterious and strange ancient artifact, Fulong Ding. At the moment, it is suspended in the void five feet away from the blood pool. From the four ancient tripod feet under the tripod, they emit a light of light purple and red. From the top, they are shining on the four strange animals. From a distance, they can see. It is obvious that in the four rays of light, there is a kind of invisible and full spiritual power, which is forcibly absorbed from those exotic animals and belongs to the Fulong Ding Ding body.</p>
<p>Because of absorbing the almost endless spiritual power of these exotic animals, the original simple and deep appearance of Fulong Ding has gradually begun to change. The whole tripod is covered with a steaming auspicious atmosphere. The original simple color is slowly fading away, and is replaced by a kind of warm and moist jade, gradually becoming a transparent color.</p>
<p>At a glance, it almost makes people think that this is the legendary immortal family holy thing, extraordinary and refined, and it is incompatible with the blood pool full of blood smell.</p>
<p>However, under the appearance of immortality, there is another difference, that is, the mysterious pattern on the tripod body inscription. The images of the four monsters are bright and dark. The huge tripod inscription, which symbolizes the Fulong Ding itself, is also slowly changing colors. Only the top of the pattern, the ferocious face of the God, is as red as blood, as if greedily absorbed Strength is to survive.</p>
<p>On the high platform far away from the blood pool, the ghost king and Mr. ghost stood side by side.</p>
<p>Mr. ghost was dressed in black, and the whole person seemed to be shrouded in a dark shadow. Even standing in front of him, he seemed to be unable to see his figure.</p>
<p>At the moment, he was saying to the ghost king in a low voice: &ldquo;yes, the inscription on the body of the Fulong Ding Ding Ding is indeed true. The four spirits gather together and the chaos will open. At the moment, the&rdquo; four spirit blood array &ldquo;has been completed, and the rest is waiting for the Fulong Ding to gather the four spirits. The chaotic power is enough to open the&rdquo; gate of Shura &ldquo;again, so that you can control the world The supreme power is invincible. &quot;</p>
<p>The ghost King&rsquo;s face was flushed and his eyes were shining. He was staring at the Fulong Ding in the air. He couldn&rsquo;t hide his excitement. He suddenly looked up to the sky, but he burst out laughing.</p>
<p>The laughter was loud and wild, with arrogance and rebelliousness, as if he had been king over the world, but the arrogant laughter was interrupted suddenly. The ghost King&rsquo;s eyebrows wrinkled, but he gently pressed his hand on his heart. At the same time, the red tide on his face instantly subsided, and a pale color appeared.</p>
<p>But a moment later, he saw the gold flash on his face, and soon recovered to normal.</p>
<p>Mr. ghost stood aside and looked at all the changes in his expression. With his insight and insight, he could not help but be surprised and said, &ldquo;who did you fight with? Who is that person? How can you do this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost King took a deep breath, and his face was completely restored to normal. After closing his eyes for a moment, he slowly opened his eyes. The cold light flashed in his eyes. The cold voice said, &ldquo;Da Fan Prajna&rdquo; and &ldquo;Taiji Xuanqing Dao&rdquo; As expected, they are all marvellous and wonderful methods. Although they are not as sharp as the magic power of our demon sect, their stamina is so long and abundant that they are really terrible. &quot;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost frowned. A strange light flashed in his eyes and said, &ldquo;is it him? How could you do it with him&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>Speaking of this, he suddenly seemed to think of something: &ldquo;is it for the sake of gluttonous food?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The king of ghosts snorted, but did not answer Mr. GUI&rsquo;s words. He just said in a light way: &ldquo;the speed of this son&rsquo;s journey into the country is unexpected. I&rsquo;m afraid of the future It&rsquo;s hard to say if it&rsquo;s a disaster. &quot;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost took a deep look at the ghost king. Then he looked away and said slowly, &ldquo;the most important thing is to start with the blood array of four spirits. If you can avoid other things, you can avoid them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost King nodded slightly. &ldquo;Yes, I know the weight. Don&rsquo;t worry about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost pondered for a moment and said, &ldquo;however, with GUI Li&rsquo;s inscrutable Taoism and the enhancement of spiritual power absorbed by the four spirit blood array in the future.</p>
<p>The bloody vision must be hard to cover up. With him here, there are many variables. To avoid accidents, you&rsquo;d better find an excuse and send him out. &quot;</p>
<p>The ghost king was silent for a moment and said, &ldquo;you are right.&rdquo; After that, he frowned slightly, turned around, and slowly walked out of the blood pool.</p>
<p>Watching the ghost King&rsquo;s figure gradually disappear. Mr. ghost turned slowly, walked to the side of the platform and looked down.</p>
<p>It seems that under the double shock of the blood pool and the Fulong Ding, the strange beast Taotie, who was struggling just now, gradually lost its resistance ability. At the moment, he was also unable to fall into the water of blood and gasped for breath.</p>
<p>Looking at this scene, Mr. ghost under the black veil, slowly issued a cold but not emotional cold laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hehe The gate of Shura&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>The sound of footsteps was heard outside the stone gate. Obviously, the people came here in a hurry. After a while, a figure appeared outside the door of the grotesque stone chamber and half knelt down. He said in a loud voice, &ldquo;vice patriarch, the Lord of the ghost king has sent down a message to ask you to meet him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The voice was so loud that there were faint echoes in the stone chamber, but there was no answer.</p>
<p>The visitor was stunned for a moment, but he didn&rsquo;t look up immediately. GUI Li has always been known as a murderer in the Guiwang sect of the demon sect. Ordinary members of the cult dare not approach him, let alone be rude.</p>
<p>The man boldly raised his voice and said it again, but there was still no response. Then he raised his head and looked at the stone room. What came into his eyes was a chaotic scene. But where was the figure of the ghost and the monkey Xiao Hui who had always been with him?</p>
<p>The man called out bitterness, shook his head, and strode off.</p>
<p>At the moment, ghost Li is walking in the long corridor of the ghost King clan, and the monkey little ash lies quietly on his shoulder. He looked forward. Although he could not see the end of the road, he knew that the end of the corridor was where the ghost king lived.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway, I can&rsquo;t do nothing here, can I, Xiao Hui?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He seems to be whispering to himself, and monkey Xiaohui is also in a daze, did not notice the master&rsquo;s words.</p>
<p>And GUI Li didn&rsquo;t care. He gave a low, bitter smile and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen hope for several times. At the end of the day, it&rsquo;s a failure. But as long as Biyao is still lying there, I can&rsquo;t despair, can I? I know what you are worried about. Don&rsquo;t worry. When I find a way to cure Biyao, I will naturally ask him to return your friend. &quot;</p>
<p>The monkey&rsquo;s ear suddenly stood up, and then &ldquo;squeak&rdquo; two times, grimly smile, but the smile did not stay on his face for long, then disappeared.</p>
<p>He stood at the door of the ghost King&rsquo;s stone chamber.</p>
<p>At the heavy stone gate, a familiar voice rang out. The ghost King sat on the chair, and his daughter&rsquo;s figure flashed in his mind. A complex emotion was floating in his mind.</p>
<p>The stone gate opened, showing a ghostly figure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here you are.&rdquo; Ghost King light tunnel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; He nodded slowly, and his voice was also flat.</p>
<p>The two men were silent, as if nothing had happened between them.</p>
<p>A moment later, he said, &ldquo;there is one thing I want to tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve brought the followers back here, and I&rsquo;ve brought Taotie back to you. If there&rsquo;s nothing else to do recently, I&rsquo;d like to go out again to see if I can find a way to save Biyao.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost King frowned and took a look at the ghost. At this time, the door outside suddenly sounded the sound of rapid footsteps, and the preacher ran over. When he was about to speak in a hurry, he suddenly saw that Gui Li and the ghost King were talking face to face, and they were stunned.</p>
<p>The ghost King quietly waved to the man, who hesitated for a moment, bowed down and quietly retreated. The ghost King&rsquo;s eyes slowly turned to Gui Li&rsquo;s body. The young man was still standing there quietly. Looking at the devil sect, no matter who is standing in front of the ghost king, he is the only one. I never seem to be afraid.</p>
<p>Is this the man the daughter loves?</p>
<p>&ldquo;You go!&rdquo; Ghost King&rsquo;s voice, suddenly seems to be a bit more tired.</p>
<p>GUI Li nodded in silence. Although both of them pretended not to be the same, it was obvious. The relationship between them, which was originally not cordial, seems to have alienated a lot.</p>
<p>He turned and walked out, but at the moment when he was about to cross the threshold, his body suddenly stopped. A strange and inexplicable breath, I don&rsquo;t know where it comes from. Suddenly, it&rsquo;s like being in the abyss where thousands of feet of blood gather. It&rsquo;s hard to breathe. It&rsquo;s like a huge wave passing by in a twinkling of an eye. The bloody air is like a disaster. Roaring in the ear.</p>
<p>His face changed!</p>
<p>But this strange breath, like a dream, was fleeting, and the surrounding area was quiet and recovered as usual.</p>
<p>The ghost King&rsquo;s voice slowly sounded behind him, flat and without a trace of emotion. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stood for a moment with his back to him and said, &ldquo;nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that, he walked slowly away.</p>
<p>Shimen. He closed it slowly behind him. When he was fully engaged with the stone wall, he suddenly turned around with great speed and the essence of his eyes flashed. Looking deeply at the stone gate of the ghost king, his eyes are deep and hard to understand, and seems to have some confusion.</p>
<p>And the ghost king in the stone chamber looked at the stone gate without expression for a long time. He seemed to be thinking about something, but finally he shook his head. He turned around and walked to the other end of the stone chamber and took a few shots on it. A moment later, the seemingly complete stone wall moved aside to the side, revealing a secret passage for one person to pass through, and a strong smell of blood also came out of the secret passage.</p>
<p>The ghost King walked in without expression. The stone wall was behind him and closed slowly.</p>
<p>A certain place in Central China is thousands of miles away from southern Xinjiang, but it is closer to Qingyun Mountain.</p>
<p>Here is the barren mountains and mountains, few people can see the ups and downs of the mountains, one of the long rivers flowing through.</p>
<p>If the geographical records are carefully considered, the nameless mountain range here should belong to the tail part of the huge Qingyun Mountain range, and the long river between the high mountains can be regarded as one of the upstream tributaries of the river outside Heyang city. But after all, it is far away from the Qingyun spirit pulse. There are only beasts, apes and tigers, but there is not a trace of immortal spirit.</p>
<p>But in this world where the world forgets, it has been broken today.</p>
<p>The two figures passed by, chasing each other before and after. The former was covered with black shadow, while the latter one flashed with gray light. They were both as fast as lightning. In the air or up or down, the dark shadow suddenly falls into the forest, twists and turns, doing his best. However, the gray shadow behind him really has unexpected magic power. When he sees the moves, he actually chases them closely, never falling down half a minute. He is still approaching.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the dark figure in front of him seemed to know that he could not get rid of the pursuit of the people behind him for the time being. Suddenly, his body suddenly gave a meal in the fast and electric dash. At that time, the shadow trembled and was nailed in place like a nail. But almost at the same time, the shadow quickly and incomparably turned around, and his right hand touched five times.</p>
<p>In the wild forest, in the daytime, there were five dark fires. Among the flames, there were ferocious skeletons. The wind was blowing, but the gray shadow was chasing after him.</p>
<p>The gray shadow had reached the front of him in an instant, but he also said that he would stop at the same time. He was so engrossed that he did not dare to take the five points of Yin Fire lightly. A moment later, I saw a flash of cold light on the hand of the grey shadow man, but he offered a crystal clear tubular magic weapon with two sharp ends.</p>
<p>As soon as the magic weapon appeared, the ground around and the branches of barren trees were covered with a layer of frost, and the surrounding temperature suddenly became cold. The five points of Yin fire came like wind, and the magic weapon of grey Shadow Man whirled in the air, but all the five points of Yin fire were absorbed on the magic weapon tube.</p>
<p>After a moment, if the fire meets the ice, the five o&rsquo;clock overcast slowly and finally disappears.</p>
<p>And the black light and gray gas gradually dissipated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nine cold coagulating ice stab It&rsquo;s really a magic weapon! &quot; Like exclamation, like appreciation, but there is no angry tone, the man in black quietly tunnel.</p>
<p>Standing opposite him was an old man in gray. He was the second figure in the burning incense Valley in southern Xinjiang. He was in charge of official policy. Naturally, the magic weapon in his hand was also the Jiuhan ice sting that Jiuwei Tianhu was afraid of.</p>
<p>Shangguan CE laughed twice and said in a low voice, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not easy to get your Lich praise!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man in black was the Lich who escaped from the ancient cave in Nanjiang town on that day. I don&rsquo;t know why he and shangguance became such a chasing situation.</p>
<p>The Lich looked up and down at shangguance, then sighed suddenly and said, &ldquo;my friend, you and I are not friends for one or two days. Why do you have to force me hard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shangguan CE said, &ldquo;my purpose has been told you for a long time. It doesn&rsquo;t mean anything else. The Lord of the burning incense Valley wants to see you. You can talk about some things in depth. So please move to the incense valley. It&rsquo;s so simple.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Lich shook his head and said with a wry smile, &ldquo;your elder martial brother, the valley master, is too scheming. Although I am crazy about living in the world, I can&rsquo;t compare myself with him.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re coming from. It&rsquo;s just for the secrets of our sorcerer clan? &quot;</p>
<p>Shangguan CE snorted and said, &ldquo;you know, the southern Xinjiang is in a mess and the five ethnic groups are in chaos. We need the burning incense Valley to take charge of the grand plan. Besides, we are not malicious. Anyway, we are much better than the ferocious monster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Lich gave him a deep look and said, &ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t know the secret of the Lich family&rsquo;s sky fire. Old friend, you can let me go of our friendship for many years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shangguan shook his head and said, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that, he slowly rowed across a semicircle in the air, sending out cold air, and forced the Lich to come again.</p>
<p>The Lich stood still. I don&rsquo;t know if she has realized that it is impossible for her to escape from the pursuit of Shangguan&rsquo;s policy. She gives up her efforts and says, &ldquo;my friend, the world is so big that everything changes for no reason. I didn&rsquo;t follow my mother and elder brother in Jiuquan that day. I wanted to take advantage of my life and go to the Middle Earth to see the world. Don&rsquo;t you want to give me a chance even for this little request? &quot;</p>
<p>Shangguan CE snorted coldly and ignored it. Obviously, he didn&rsquo;t believe it at all. At the moment, he was three feet in front of the lich, but at this moment, his face suddenly changed and his eyes were fixed on the ground.</p>
<p>In the daytime, the sun was shining down. The Lich&rsquo;s body seemed to be floating, but there was no sign of shadow. Moreover, the body trembled gently with the wind, and there were signs of floating.</p>
<p>Shangguan CE&rsquo;s body moved. In a flash, he reached the front of the lich, and the nine cold ice stabs fell off his head. At that time, he saw a cold light, which was indestructible, and split the Lich in two from the middle. However, the two bodies turned into black smoke and quickly dispersed in the air.</p>
<p>Shangguan CE was so angry that his face turned white. He knew that he was hit by the Lich again. With a firm stamp of his foot, he got up and jumped into the air. Looking around, he saw a dark shadow running away from him, but he was heading for the north. Not to mention it, he turned into grey light and went straight after him. (to be continued. )</p>
