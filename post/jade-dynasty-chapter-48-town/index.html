      <p>Zhang Xiaofan looked deeply at the middle-aged scholar who called himself &ldquo;ten thousand people&rdquo; in front of him, with a bad premonition in his heart, but at the same time, there was another power in his heart, which made him involuntarily ask: &ldquo;please give me some advice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ten thousand people took a deep look at him, and said slowly, &ldquo;the black short stick is very powerful. The black light is moist and introverted. If people are close to it, within three feet, the whole body&rsquo;s Qi and blood must be forced by the evil spirit and pour into the heart to die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s heart moved, and he couldn&rsquo;t help saying, &ldquo;yes, when I met this thing, I felt heavy and nauseous from afar, and almost fainted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ten thousand people sighed and looked at him and said, &ldquo;yes, that&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; with a slight frown and a low sigh, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s really strange that you should not die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan didn&rsquo;t catch what he was saying. He asked, &ldquo;what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ten thousand people smiled at him, but didn&rsquo;t reply to him. They just pointed to the fire stick and said, &ldquo;this black short stick, originally a natural and vicious thing, is called&rdquo; soul taking &ldquo;. It&rsquo;s not a demon sect thing. It has never been born for thousands of years. It&rsquo;s only recorded in the ancient book alone. Little brother Zhang has a profound fortune, so he can get these two treasures in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dementor!&rdquo; Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s face was dull, and he read a low sentence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo; Ten thousand people calmed down and said, &ldquo;there is a record in the ancient book ten chapters of different treasures: the sky is extremely iron, falling on the nine secluded places, the ghost fire burns the spirit of the netherworld to refine it, the thousand year square red, the thousand year formation, the thousand year gathering spirit of the ghost, the thousand year becomes the ability of soul absorption. In fact, these vicious things are beyond the control of strangers. I didn&rsquo;t expect little brother Zhang&hellip;&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dang&hellip;&rdquo; With a loud crash, the black fire stick fell from Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s hand and fell to the ground. Zhang Xiaofan was soft in both hands and feet, but he felt extremely stuffy in the chest. He staggered back a few steps and stared at the fire stick that had been with him all these years. He couldn&rsquo;t speak.</p>
<p>Ten thousand people looked at him in horror. But suddenly there was a sneer on his face and said, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s wrong with you, little brother Zhang?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan shook his head hard, and almost felt extremely painful when he spoke. &ldquo;Murmured:&rdquo; how, how can it be like this, I am under the Qingyun gate, how can I use such evil things At this time, he also remembered that he was in the abyss of the dead spirit. No wonder those ghosts were so afraid of his fire staff. They were afraid that this &ldquo;soul taking&rdquo; might be the most strange thing.</p>
<p>Ten thousand people look at him.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to know that the young man has been growing up in the Qingyun gate. He has never seen anything in the world. Now he is almost at a loss in the face of great changes. He just looks like him, but he seems to have no consolation, just a light way: &ldquo;evil things? What do you think is evil? &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan seemed to have lost his soul and pointed to the fire stick on the ground, saying: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how many lives have been harmed by this thing. Isn&rsquo;t it evil?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ten thousand people sneer: &ldquo;kill many people, is it evil?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan almost didn&rsquo;t want to. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said</p>
<p>Ten thousand people looked sarcastic, and the power and evil spirit between their eyebrows gradually came out. The whole person seemed to have changed another person, but Zhang Xiaofan was confused, but he didn&rsquo;t notice it. Only listen to 10000 people to say: &ldquo;excuse me, boar sow, black pig white pig, can all be pigs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan did not expect ten thousand people to suddenly come out of this sentence, Zheng for a while, said: &ldquo;naturally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the lion and the goat,&rdquo; said the ten thousand. Tiger rabbit, kill each other, but are all creatures? Can it be divided into good and evil? &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan felt what he was going to say, but he still didn&rsquo;t understand it. Only way: &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ten thousand people to hum a, way: &ldquo;that again excuse me sir, you so-called right way evil way, can all be a person?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan stayed for a while, deliberately refuted, but to the mouth but found no words. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said</p>
<p>Ten thousand people looked at him in awe, until they saw Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s heart was a little hairy, and then they heard him slowly saying, &ldquo;brother Zhang, you have a famous Zhenshan treasure in Qingyun Mountain, that is, ancient swords kill immortals. Do you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s mood at this time has almost been completely given to the left and right by this first meeting of ten thousand people. Unconsciously, he said, &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wan Ren&rsquo;s face suddenly sank, and he snapped, &ldquo;then you know how many people and lives this immortal sword killed in the battle between the demons a thousand years ago? If we talk about the world today, the world&rsquo;s magic weapon, the one who really kills the most people and has the most evil spirit, I&rsquo;m afraid there is no more ancient sword that you regard as a god! &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s head was buzzing loudly, and he could not help but step back, as if he had been punched in the face. At the same time, he seemed to feel that in the deep heart, there was something sacred and inviolable since he was a child. After a faint and clear echo, there was a small crack for the first time.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>The sun is shining brightly. From the top of the tree, through the thick leaves, it becomes a little sunshine, which falls on the ground. With the constant shaking of the leaves, it is like a naughty child, beating gently.</p>
<p>Sometimes a few sunshine fell on the boy.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan squats on the ground, in front of him is the fire stick lying on the ground peacefully. In the shadow, it looks ugly and ugly. In fact, what the ten thousand people said was not quite different from what they said that day in the air mulberry mountain, but from what he said, Zhang Xiaofan felt very different. In his heart, there was a figure, and he sneered low: he was right, he was right.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of people sit quietly and drink the cold tea. In the distance, the elderly tea stall owner looks at this place, and then turns away his eyes. He doesn&rsquo;t know that the young people here are like the raging sea in their hearts!</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how long later, Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s face gradually subsided from the original anxiety, struggle and pain. He slowly extended his hand, grabbed the fire stick on the ground in his hand, stood up, went to the ten thousand people, and said coldly, &ldquo;who are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ten thousand people return to his casual style at this moment. The evil spirit between the eyebrows disappears, and a light smile says: &ldquo;me? I&rsquo;m a man of ten thousand. I&rsquo;m just a common man traveling around the world. &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan stared at him, slowly clenched his hand and said: &ldquo;how can ordinary people know so much? Are you a demon of the demon sect</p>
<p>Ten thousand people pour to also have no reaction, just look at him, light tunnel: &ldquo;the difference between good and evil, for you, really so important?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan breathed deeply and said: &ldquo;yes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ten thousand people sneered and said, &ldquo;so it is. Why are you still using this evil thing of the demon sect? &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan shuddered, but his face was awe inspiring, and said: &ldquo;this fire stick may be an evil thing, but I use it to cut off demons and eliminate demons. It is the right way, and I will have a clear conscience, just as you said that the ancient sword in our family killed the immortals. &quot;</p>
<p>Ten thousand people stood up slowly and looked at Zhang Xiaofan.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a new understanding of this man, with a smile on the corner of his mouth, saying: &ldquo;you can think of this layer by yourself. It&rsquo;s rare. It&rsquo;s just this idea that beats you Qingyun. No, it&rsquo;s most people in the world!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan doesn&rsquo;t talk to him, but stares at him and says, &ldquo;who are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ten thousand people go but don&rsquo;t answer him. Instead, he said, &ldquo;you are going north this time, but do you want to go back to Qingyun Mountain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; said Zhang Xiaofan</p>
<p>Ten thousand people smiled and said: &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t know yet. Now the evil cult has risen again and its power has soared. Recently, it gathered on Liubo mountain in the East China Sea. Many people have gone to Qingyun gate, where they will meet with other factions. Maybe there will be a war. Why don&rsquo;t you go and have a look? &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan stayed for a while and said, &ldquo;what happened?&rdquo; But then he looked up and said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s none of my business. I&rsquo;ll ask you again&hellip;&rdquo; The words were broken before they were finished. In this lost time, thousands of people disappeared like ghosts. Even the owner of the tea stall in the distance disappeared. There was only a lonely tea stall and Zhang Xiaofan alone.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan looked around in the broad daylight. Somehow, he felt a chill.</p>
<p>He stood in place for a long time, and finally saw that he was a stamp of foot, out of the tree, to the East.</p>
<p>After Zhang Xiaofan had gone for a while, three or two people turned out from behind the big tree. The first one was ten thousand people, one was the owner of the tea stall, and the other one, but Zhang Xiaofan saw the evil cult girl - Biyao, who must have been shocked.</p>
<p>Ten thousand people looked to the East, nodded slightly, smiled a little at the corner of their mouth, and said, &ldquo;this young man is stubborn and determined, but a little like me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tea stall owner standing beside him is not that old-fashioned at the moment, but has a clear and powerful look. He said: &ldquo;master, since he has our magic sect treasure in his hand, why don&rsquo;t he keep this man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ten thousand people went to the place called &ldquo;the patriarch&rdquo; and said simply: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how to absorb blood beads and soul, but this young man fused with blood essence and became the object of blood refining. Now no one can drive away this magic weapon except this young man. It&rsquo;s useless for us to rob it. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said how I looked at this stick under the lifeless abyss that day. It turned out to be so big,&rdquo; said Biyao with a snort</p>
<p>Ten thousand people turn their heads to see Baguio. Their faces are soft. They say, &ldquo;Baguio, what do you think of this young man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biyao blushed and said angrily, &ldquo;Dad, today is my daughter who asked you to see how he is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ten thousand people laughed and said: &ldquo;this young man is still good. He was poisoned by Qingyun gate since he was a child. He wanted him to join our holy religion. He was stubborn, but he was afraid of difficulties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biyao&rsquo;s face suddenly darkened and sighed in a low voice.</p>
<p>Ten thousand people stretched out their hands, gently stroked their daughter&rsquo;s hair, and smiled, &ldquo;but he can untie your heart knot over the years, and let our father and daughter reconcile again. We must return this feeling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Baguio&rsquo;s face moved, and she said, &ldquo;Dad, do you have a way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ten thousand people look up at the sky, and a momentum slowly spreads out, which shows that he is a person with long-term power in the palm of his hand. But somehow, looking at his expression, it seems that he is a little pathetic, only listening to his slow way: &ldquo;it is not easy to change a person&rsquo;s temperament, but it is not impossible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Baguio was very happy. Thousands of people turned to look at her eyes and smiled, just like all the fathers in the world when they saw their daughter&rsquo;s happiness. Biyao smiled at his father, but noticed that the man next to him frowned and whispered to ten thousand people, &ldquo;master, it&rsquo;s just an unknown boy in Qingyun gate. Is it worth our effort?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ten thousand people shook their heads and said, &ldquo;that young man has a long-standing magic weapon in his hand, and he seems to be able to operate freely. He must not be a thing in the pool in the future. If he can receive it, it will be very helpful to my hegemony, let alone help our father and daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biyao nodded repeatedly and said, &ldquo;yes, I told him that day. If you can join my holy religion, your father will certainly value him. He will not listen. &quot;</p>
<p>Ten thousand people to laugh, said: &ldquo;how can he listen? He has that temperament. Growing up in Qingyun since childhood, I have long hated our saints. It&rsquo;s just that, hehe, the blood bead and soul absorption are the most fierce things in the world, although they are now inexplicably refined into a blood refining magic weapon by this young man. The evil spirit is introverted and not exposed, but how can these two fierce things have no influence on you? In my opinion, the young man is not deeply cultivated. He is with this fierce thing day and night. After a long time, he is attacked by the violence in the magic weapon, and his temperament will change, so that he can kill and eat blood. At that time, the right way will not be allowed to him. No matter how little we do, it will be difficult for him not to join my church. &quot; Say it and laugh.</p>
<p>After staying for a while, Biyao couldn&rsquo;t say whether she was happy or worried. She couldn&rsquo;t say anything. She had to stare at the East, but she saw the sun shining brightly. In the middle of the day, on the ancient road, she had not seen the young figure for a long time.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan left the tea stand. Go east alone.</p>
<p>At this time, it was noon. The sun was shining on the earth. After passing the mountain area of kongsang mountain, it was a fertile field. It&rsquo;s empty and sparsely populated. There is only one ancient road. I don&rsquo;t know how many ancient and modern people have stepped on it. On this field, it stretches straight forward.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan did not fly in the sky, but walked silently on the ancient road. The conversation with thousands of people just now has a great impact on him. Although he spoke to thousands of people in the face of justice. But at this moment, when he was alone, he could not help asking himself: am I really right?</p>
<p>The black fire stick still nestles in his waist quietly. If there is no ground, it feels cool from its body.</p>
<p>Walking, walking, walking</p>
<p>Under the sky, on the ancient road, the young man full of worry suddenly stopped and looked up at the sky.</p>
<p>It was blue that day. It was so high and unattainable.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan looked at it in a dazed way. He moved his lips slightly. His brows were wrinkled together. He looked down to the sky, as if to whose deep heart, and said softly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the purpose of living in the world?&rdquo;</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>On the way, Zhang Xiaofan slept in the open. Although there was not much silver on his body, he caught some wild birds and rabbits in the wild when he was hungry. When he was sleepy, he would find a tree to spend the night. Anyway, he used to be strong on the bamboo peak because of his bamboo cutting homework, but he didn&rsquo;t feel hard.</p>
<p>In fact, it would be faster for him to fight against the fire stick and fight against the sky, but somehow he didn&rsquo;t plan to do so. He always felt bored. There were always those troubles in his mind, so he would rather walk slowly, hoping to figure out his own doubts.</p>
<p>But when it comes to this, Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s question at the moment, but how can he be understood by such a young man? If he wants to break his head, he always feels that the past teaching of the school is sacred and natural, and it&rsquo;s definitely not wrong. But again, it seems that there are some reasons for what those ten thousand people have said. It&rsquo;s really confusing.</p>
<p>If someone else, such as his six elder martial brother Du Bishu, is changed, the thief will smile and leave it alone. Anyway, I am under Qingyun gate and naturally listen to Qingyun gate&rsquo;s words. But if his elder martial brother song Daren is strict and doesn&rsquo;t believe in the so-called heresy at all, he will not even think about it.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan is the only one who is more stubborn than others. When confronted with this problem, which is almost a total challenge to his previous beliefs, he wants to think hard and come up with a clear idea.</p>
<p>In this way, he buried himself in thought and walked for three days, but still couldn&rsquo;t think of the reason why he came.</p>
<p>On this day, Zhang Xiaofan suddenly felt that there were more and more pedestrians on the road. He looked forward, but there was a small town in front of the ancient road. Although it was not large, it might be on the ancient road, but there were many people.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s heart was filled with joy, but he also forgot his troubles for a while. There were few people on the road in the past three days. At this time, seeing such a small town made people feel refreshed.</p>
<p>When I got close to the town, I saw a stone tablet standing by the road near the town entrance. It was engraved with the words &ldquo;Xiaochi town&rdquo;. I think it&rsquo;s the name of the town.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan walked in, only to hear the voice of people gradually growing up. The ancient road went straight through the town. There were houses and eaves along the road, and some shops, but more of them were hawkers who directly set up stalls on both sides of the road. They walked along the street and heard a lot of peddling. It&rsquo;s a picture of the world.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan walked in the crowd, with a smile on his lips. When he was still living in Caomiao village when he was young, he vaguely remembered the same appearance. Compared with the cultivation years on Qingyun Mountain, fireworks in the world seem to have a different taste in mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dangdangdangdangdangdangdang&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Zhang Xiaofan was still immersed in the memories of the past, suddenly there was a loud Gong on the street ahead, which scared him. Then he saw the surrounding townspeople speeding up their steps and running forward first. In the middle of the room, he heard several people talking while walking: &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go. The mayor is calling for a speech.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I heard that last night the mayor and Li Baochang and fan Xiucai discussed for a whole night. I wonder if there is a way out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope there&rsquo;s a way, or I won&rsquo;t be able to live this life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan listened to this, but his curiosity was caught up, and he went forward with the flow of people.</p>
<p>Only to see the crowd gathered around, not too much time. Then two or three hundred people were gathered around a stone platform in the center of the town.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan stood in the crowd and looked into the middle. He saw that the stone platform was more than half tall. It was smooth. There were three people standing on it, two old and one young. I think it was the mayor, Li Baochang and fan Xiucai who had just heard about it.</p>
<p>Seeing that people were coming, the oldest of the three on the stone platform stood up and waved to the townspeople below. The townspeople gradually quieted down.</p>
<p>When it was completely quiet, the old man looked around with a heavy voice and said, &ldquo;folks. I gather you here today. I think you know what happened. Since three months ago, the evil spirit lived in the &ldquo;black stone hole&rdquo; ten li away from the town, and has been harassing the town ever since. Since the last month, it has become even worse. At night, countless cattle, sheep and poultry were taken away. What&rsquo;s more, three days ago, the king&rsquo;s father and son rebelled against the last cow in their family, and they were Alas, it is unfortunate that he died in the hands of that demon. &quot;</p>
<p>There was a sigh among the townspeople around, and a few of them even shouted abuse. Zhang Xiaofan understood most of them, but he still didn&rsquo;t know what the devil was.</p>
<p>At this time, the mayor said: &ldquo;I am ashamed that I am the mayor of the town, but I can&rsquo;t guarantee the safety of the town. Last night, after consulting with Li Baochang and fan Xiucai, I thought that since the evil spirit is extraordinary, it is beyond our ability to resist. I would like to post a notice and ask some monks to come back to collect the demon. As for the cost, I also need your full support. &quot;</p>
<p>As soon as he finished speaking, the townspeople under the stage said one after another: &ldquo;what the mayor said is reasonable, it&rsquo;s to ask the superior to come back and catch the demon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you go on like this, I&rsquo;m afraid that people will be eaten by that evil spirit. Do you care about that little money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three people on the platform agreed with the villagers, and the mayor seemed to be relieved, saying: &ldquo;in that case, last night I asked fan Xiucai to write a notice, and then it was posted.&rdquo; Then he nodded to the young man who looked like a scholar. The scholar answered, took out a piece of white paper from his arms, with some handwriting on it, walked down the stone platform, went to a brick wall standing next to him, and pasted it on it.</p>
<p>The townspeople immediately embraced the past. Zhang Xiaofan also followed the past and saw that the paper said:</p>
<p>Today, there are three evil foxes living in the black stone cave ten miles away from the town. They come out in the daytime and at night. They harass the town, plunder poultry, cattle and sheep, and hurt people. However, their evil methods are so powerful. Now, we invite some experts to eliminate the harm for the people. Xiaochi town is willing to thank them with five hundred Liang silver coins.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan looked at the people of Xiaochi Town, and listened to the approval of the surrounding residents. He hesitated for a moment. He had the intention to do this good thing. But when he thought of the words of the townspeople and the mayor just now, the evil spirit was afraid to be very tight. His magic power was low, but it was a small thing to defeat the evil spirit. He lost his life and the face of the school accidentally, which he could not afford.</p>
<p>He was hesitating in this room, when he heard a sudden uproar from the townspeople around him. He looked up and was surprised. He saw a huge man coming from the outside. When he went there, he only used his hands to flick, and the crowd separated like water.</p>
<p>When the giant man got close, Zhang Xiaofan could see it clearly. Last year, he didn&rsquo;t have much discipline. At most, he was twenty years old. He had big eyebrows, big eyes, square face and wide ears. With his amazing figure, he came face to face with a powerful spirit.</p>
<p>Among the crowd, the tallest one is only his shoulder, which really stands out from the rest.</p>
<p>I saw him stride to the wall and read the notice carefully without saying anything. I actually pulled it off.</p>
<p>There was a scream in the crowd. The huge man turned around and gave a sweeping glance to the people around him. The townspeople were quiet at once. Only listen to the great man&rsquo;s voice: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the only stone of the King Kong gate&rsquo;s leader, Dali Zun. I have been ordered by my master to practice. Now I will do this service for you. &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was stunned for a while. He searched his mind and never heard of this Vajra sect.</p>
<p>Everyone around him was staring at him. At this time, the mayor and others rushed to the huge man who called himself stone. The mayor carefully said: &ldquo;this Strong man, that evil spirit is very powerful. It&rsquo;s not, cough. It&rsquo;s not just strong. It&rsquo;s dangerous. Do you want to think about it? &quot;</p>
<p>The giant man nodded, looked at the mayor, and said in a voice, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you believe me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mayor was stared at by him. I didn&rsquo;t feel a little hairy in my heart, and then I said, &ldquo;no, no, I just want to remind you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The giant turned his head and looked around. After a while, his eyes fell on the brick wall where the notice was posted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this wall useful to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mayor was stunned for a moment and said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s useless in ordinary days, just to post a notice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The huge man called stone laughed and suddenly shouted, &ldquo;get out of the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sound is like thunder. Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s ears are also buzzing, let alone other townspeople. All of them lost color. In a moment, a big open space was opened in the field, only the giant man stood in the middle.</p>
<p>I saw him frowning and shaking his hands. Suddenly, he stamped his right foot on the ground with a heavy stamp, made a mark with one hand, recited the short mantra in a low voice, and drank loudly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hoo&rdquo;, a gust of wind came from the huge man. Roaring past the ears of all the people, they couldn&rsquo;t stand. All the people lost their color, and they stepped back a few steps. When the golden light rose, the giant man suddenly offered a huge golden mace, which was shining across the sky. There were two words &ldquo;breaking evil spirit&rdquo; engraved on it. It was solemn.</p>
<p>The crowd cheered at once. Zhang Xiaofan stood in the crowd, but frowned. In those years, he received the &ldquo;great Brahma Prajna&rdquo; Dharma from Puzhi. Although there was no one to teach him these years, he could not practice it secretly. He knew something about the Dharma of Buddhism. At present, the wolf toothed stick, which was offered by the huge stone man, is golden and solemn. Looking at his gesture, it&rsquo;s similar to the general wisdom of that year. I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s probably related to Buddhism.</p>
<p>This golden mace is so huge that it seems to be bigger than its owner. At this time, it is held in the air by the stone. The golden light is so big that you can see the stone&rsquo;s eyes are wide open. The mace roars in the air and falls on your head.</p>
<p>Everyone exclaimed!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roar&rdquo;, in the loud sound, the dust flies, originally a good brick wall, in a moment, under his magic power, it turns into Zifen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow&hellip;&rdquo; All the people in the town were stunned, and then they all laughed. Since the giant man has such great power, it&rsquo;s easy to get rid of the three Tailed Fox. The mayor first came out and laughed and said, &ldquo;stone warrior is good at something, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stone nodded.</p>
<p>After a pause, the mayor suddenly hesitated, and said, &ldquo;but there is one thing, I hope stone warrior can understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The strong man named stone may speak in a tone of voice, which is still the same at the moment: &ldquo;please say it, old man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mayor said: &ldquo;as for the reward, because it&rsquo;s all the hard-earned money of the townspeople, I hope to wait until the heroes get rid of the evil before&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, when stone heard this, he waved his hand and said: &ldquo;never mind. Before I went out, the master told me that we are righteous people. If we have evil spirits, we should stand up as if we were practicing our cultivation. As for what money is not, you don&rsquo;t need to mention it any more. You only need to worry about my full meal, and I will have the strength to get rid of the demon when I&rsquo;m full. &quot;</p>
<p>The mayor was very happy. There are also such cheap things. Naturally, they can&rsquo;t be better. Then he said: &ldquo;this nature, this nature, warrior, please come with me, and let the warrior be satisfied.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan listened to the words of the stone. He felt ashamed for a while. He thought that Shifu and Shiniang had taught his brothers the same way in the past. However, he was afraid of things. He lost Shifu&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>When he thought about it, he was full of blood and thought that he was just a decent man. How can I ignore this matter and think that I will take a step, open my mouth to show my identity, and remove the demon together with the stone.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, his foot only raised three points. At the moment when I just left the ground, I suddenly heard a voice beside me, a little anxious and eager, saying: &ldquo;ah, this little brother. You cover the roof with black clouds, the printing hall turns black, and your face is dead. It&rsquo;s not good! &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was full of confidence. When he reached his throat, he was about to say something and do something just. Unexpectedly, he was shocked by what someone said in his ear. Sheng Sheng choked back. One careless step at the foot, stagger one step, step on the wrong place, actually stepped on a pile of shit.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan jumped up, but he felt that his feet were stinking. Though he was separated from the sole of his shoes, he felt cold in his heart. He felt that his body was shaking. Now, hate and hate turn around and want to see who the speaker is?</p>
<p>I saw an old man standing beside me. He has white hair and plain face. It seems that he has the appearance of an expert. At the first sight, people have some respect. Beside the old man, there is a little girl aged eight or nine, wearing two braids. She is lively and lovely, with a bunch of ice sugar gourd in her hand. Eating with relish.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was stopped by the old man&rsquo;s demeanor for a moment, but he could not scold him. He was thinking about what to say, but only saw the old man look at his feet, not only did not look sorry, but also looked urgent. &ldquo;Look, look, isn&rsquo;t this a big omen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was surprised and said, &ldquo;what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man took a look at him and said: &ldquo;haven&rsquo;t you heard the saying: when you step on shit, you&rsquo;ll be forced by bad luck; when ten people die nine times, you&rsquo;ll be full of bad luck?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was dumbfounded and said: &ldquo;no, I only heard that elder martial brothers said that it&rsquo;s a good way for people to get along, so people would say that he came here with shit&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man stayed for a while, shook his head repeatedly, and said: &ldquo;muddleheaded, muddleheaded, it&rsquo;s nonsense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; said Zhang Xiaofan</p>
<p>That old head way: &ldquo;since say so, do you have to trample dog excrement on purpose everyday?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was shocked. He remembered that when he was on the bamboo peak that day, because of his youngest generation, he often had to do some dirty work, and the big dog rhubarb that Shifu Tian didn&rsquo;t easily raise</p>
<p>At once he shook his head.</p>
<p>The old man nodded and said, &ldquo;do you see others deliberately stepping on shit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan shook his head and said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not like that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; The old man clapped his hands and said, &ldquo;if there is such a thing as shit luck, is there a reason why everyone can&rsquo;t avoid it? Moreover, shit is a filthy thing of time, stinking and disgusting to everyone. If you step on it, is it not bad luck, but good luck?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Zhang Xiaofan heard this, he thought it was very reasonable. It seems that he was wrong before. Thinking of the old man&rsquo;s words just now, he was alarmist. He couldn&rsquo;t help but burst into a cold sweat and said, &ldquo;that old man, you just said me&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man frowned, looked at Zhang Xiaofan up and down, and saw that Zhang Xiaofan was upset. Then he said, &ldquo;well, it seems that you are really suffering from a disaster. Why don&rsquo;t you go to one side and wait for me to look at you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look?&rdquo; Zhang Xiaofan was stunned for a moment. Then he noticed that the old man still had a bamboo pole with a white cloth hanging on it, and wrote four words: Immortal points the way.</p>
<p>It turned out to be a fortune teller. However, Zhang Xiaofan didn&rsquo;t despise it in his mind. The reason is nothing else. The founder of Qingyun sect was also a martial arts master in the Jianghu. Of course, no one in Qingyun sect can do this. But Qingyun sect has always been friendly to the master. Otherwise, it&rsquo;s not a fraud?</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan hesitated for a moment, but found that just when he was talking with the old man, the townspeople had already walked far away with the stone giant. Now they were calm, thinking that they would let the old man take a look first, but they could not help it. Anyway, the mayor just said that he would please the giant man to eat and then remove the demon. It seems that there is still time.</p>
<p>Thinking of this, he turned to the old leader and said, &ldquo;well, please help me to have a look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man laughed and pointed his hand under a big tree beside the road. &ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s talk there.&rdquo; Then turn around and walk.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan is trying to keep up with him. Suddenly he hears a clear voice saying: &ldquo;big brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan a stay, but see is just standing beside the old man eating ice sugar gourd little girl, now I do not know why called him. Zhang Xiaofan looked at her ruddy face. She was very lovely. She leaned down with a smile and said, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter, little sister?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little girl chewed at the corner of her mouth, spit out a few nuclei, looked at Zhang Xiaofan, smiled, and said: &ldquo;there is shit under your feet, it stinks!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; Zhang Xiaofan blushed and jumped up, shaking his feet as hard as he could, shaking the dirt off his shoes.</p>
<p>The little girl looked at him in a mess, smiled, turned around, and jumped to the old man standing under the tree. (to be continued. )</p>
