      <p>On the platform of the blood pool, both GUI Li and Mr. GUI look up at the Fu Long Ding suspended in the air. However, their expressions and eyes are quite different. GUI Li is shocked with astonishment, and Mr. GUI&rsquo;s eyes behind the black veil are completely excited and ecstatic.</p>
<p>Without the lock of heaven and earth, which is the last and most important shuanjiao, the mysterious power of fulongding mountain seems to have been completely revived at the moment. The red blood is surging wildly. The devil&rsquo;s face is as bright as life. A pair of blood red eyes tremble slightly as if they are spiritually.</p>
<p>The general invisible but terrible sense of oppression, emanating from the air endlessly, almost makes people unable to breathe.</p>
<p>GUI Li came back from the shock and turned to Mr. ghost and said, &ldquo;what have you done?&rdquo; However, Mr. ghost seemed to turn a deaf ear to the ferocious drinking and swearing. His eyes were full of excitement, and even with a bit of crazy mood. After a few steps, he actually knelt down to the Fulong Ding in mid air. He looked at the black figure in disbelief.</p>
<p>Under the gaze of the ghost&rsquo;s surprised eyes, Mr. ghost opened his arms and stretched out his hands and cried out: &ldquo;Shura!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boom There was a terrible sound, like a terrible devil awakened from his sleep and swung away from the Fulong tripod. The stone walls on all sides of the cave burst at the same time. Countless huge rocks collapsed and fell one after another. The blood in the huge blood pool below the cave seemed to be pulled by a huge force. In the uproar, more than a dozen water columns burst out of thin air, strange and spectacular.</p>
<p>There is a faint red shadow on the Fulong tripod. The shadow is looming, but it is obvious that it is going to appear here in the twisting struggle. After a long distance in time, the ghost can clearly and truly feel the terrible power and the crazy killing intention among them.</p>
<p>He looked at the red shadow deeply, and his face changed rapidly several times. Suddenly, he stamped his foot, and his body floated, but he swept away to the hole. Although I don&rsquo;t know what is sacred about this strange thing coming into being. However, the great power contained in it is obviously beyond human resistance. If the mysterious lock of heaven and earth is still there, there will be a turning point. At the moment, the lock of heaven and earth has been broken by the astrolabe. However, he left here at once.</p>
<p>He was not that simple and warm-blooded youth at that time. He would sacrifice everything for justice. In his heart, he might not be afraid of death.</p>
<p>But there is something more important than death.</p>
<p>With the appearance of the strange red shadow, the earthquakes around him became more and more intense. Just now, he felt uneasy from time to time in his heart. Would this change never happen in Huqi mountain endanger Biyao?</p>
<p>At this moment, the sense of uneasiness in his heart became more and more intense, and he had no intention to entangle himself in this place, and he was determined to go. Besides him, it was obvious that Mr. ghost had put all his spirit on the mysterious red shadow at the moment. He didn&rsquo;t see GUI Li&rsquo;s leaving. Under the hard blood red light, his eyes seemed to turn red.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shura&hellip;&rdquo; He raised his hand and raised his voice to the sky.</p>
<p>The ghost&rsquo;s sharp body swept away, and the strange cry of Mr. ghost came from his ear. His heart was also suspicious of it. Over the past ten years, Mr. GUI has been mysterious in Gui Wang&rsquo;s clan. However, he has to be afraid of his moral conduct and knowledge. Unexpectedly, he has become so strange today. He was thinking how fast he was. I&rsquo;m going to steal to the entrance of the cave and leave the crazy blood pool cave.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, just at this time, a startling, heartbreaking cry came from behind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah&hellip;&rdquo; The cry was sharp and harsh, full of panic, despair, disbelief and sadness. However, it was the voice of Mr. ghost.</p>
<p>This sudden change occurred, one after another, under the terrible shock, can not help but stop and turn around to look at this. However, he was shocked and took a breath of cold air.</p>
<p>Mr. GUI&rsquo;s black body was still the same as before. He knelt down to the Dragon tripod and the mysterious red shadow on it. But at the moment, his hands, which had been held high, were slowly lowered and fell to the ground powerlessly. A huge crimson tentacle, sharp as a knife, stabbed down from the red shadow on the Fulong tripod, like a huge sickle, pierced through the back of Mr. ghost The remaining force was still so huge that it penetrated into the hard ground under Mr. GUI&rsquo;s body. Within a six foot radius, all the rocks cracked.</p>
<p>The mysterious and strange red shadow nailed Mr. GUI to the ground with horrible sickle like tentacles. The blood gushed from the wound of Mr. ghost, and instantly dyed the ground under him. &ldquo;Er ah&hellip;&rdquo; Mr. ghost was panting, and his body was shaking violently. After a moment, the huge tentacles which seemed to have no pity were pulled up and took them back. The terrible giant force immediately took the fragile Mr. ghost up and turned him into the air.</p>
<p>Blood splashes all over the air, with a bit of desolation. No one would have thought that Mr. ghost, who released the shackles of heaven and earth, became the first sacrifice of the mysterious red shadow devil!</p>
<p>Ghouli was almost subconscious. He jumped up and picked up Mr. ghost in the air. The black veil was still there, but his blood had dyed it dark. He took a look at his chest and turned his eyes away. That wound was so huge that he almost cut Mr. ghost into two sections. He was so badly hurt that he could not survive anyway. Just a moment ago, the person who was still standing by his side had changed into this kind of appearance in a twinkling of an eye. He didn&rsquo;t know what to say for a moment.</p>
<p>Holding Mr. ghost&rsquo;s body, he fell back to the platform near the entrance of the cave, far away from the terrible red shadow. At the moment, Mr. ghost, who was in his bad state, was already more out of breath and less in breath. But under such a serious injury, suddenly, Mr. ghost actually laughed in a low voice.</p>
<p>The laughter was full of bitterness, self mockery and helplessness, and his laughter only lasted for a moment, and was immediately interrupted by more severe coughing and vomiting blood.</p>
<p>GUI Li gently put him on the ground, and then took a wary look at the mysterious red shadow in the distance. He saw that the red shadow wrapped by countless groups of blood was constantly twisting and changing, but he didn&rsquo;t mean to start at the cave entrance. I don&rsquo;t know whether it was the reason for the distance.</p>
<p>GUI Li looked back at Mr. ghost. After a moment&rsquo;s silence, he said in a low voice, &ldquo;do you have anything else to say?&rdquo; Mr. ghost gasped, and the light in his eyes began to fade down obviously. With a hoarse voice, he said with a wry smile: &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t No words, this, this is God, will, retribution Retribution Retribution Ah&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>His eyebrows were wrinkled. Although he had always been more hostile than friendly with Mr. ghost, at the moment when Mr. ghost was dying, his mood suddenly became complicated. I want to say something to comfort him, but I can&rsquo;t think of any suitable words to comfort Mr. ghost.</p>
<p>Just as the gasping voice of the seriously injured ghost man gradually faded, suddenly, the dying man seemed to suddenly remember something, and did not know where the strength came from among the remnant body. It was a sudden grasp of the fierce hand.</p>
<p>However, he was startled and looked at him with astonishment and said, &ldquo;how?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You Go to Looking for To&hellip; &quot; Mr. ghost was in great pain and hoarse. Every word he said seemed to have made him suffer. However, he was still bitter and said his last words to Gui Li.</p>
<p>Even if the ghost is hard hearted, can&rsquo;t help but change color for it, Su Rong way: &ldquo;you say, want me to look for who?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looking for Little Ring&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>The body was shocked. In any case, I would not have thought that Mr. ghost had suddenly said such a word when he was dying. He said in disbelief, &ldquo;look for Xiaohuan? What do you want from her? &quot;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost took hold of the strength of GUI Li&rsquo;s hand and gradually weakened, but he was still struggling to speak word by word: &ldquo;call She Go to Save Save Save&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>Speaking of the word &ldquo;rescue&rdquo;, Mr. ghost seems to have exhausted all his strength. The luster in his eyes is getting weaker and weaker, and the whole person is also slowly softening down, even gasping. And it&rsquo;s not going to be heard.</p>
<p>GUI Li and Xiao Huan have a close relationship. They always like this little girl very much. They think she is her sister. Now I heard Mr. GUI&rsquo;s last words about Xiao Huan. But Mr. ghost is so hard, but he still has to struggle. Obviously, it matters a lot.</p>
<p>But now Mr. ghost said half of what he had said, but he had a lot of appearance of dying at this moment. GUI Li&rsquo;s heart was in a hurry. He threw down his body and put his ear close to Mr. ghost&rsquo;s lips and said in a loud voice, &ldquo;who are you asking Xiaohuan to save? Tell me quickly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost&rsquo;s lips moved, as if he had heard a fierce cry. He gasped for a few times, then struggled to say the last words: &ldquo;save Qing Cloud After Mountain&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>At the end of the speech, he gradually became unable to smell. When he finally vomited out a &ldquo;mountain&rdquo; which was almost imperceptible, Mr. ghost suddenly trembled. Then his whole body relaxed and his breath was cut off. However, he passed away.</p>
<p>GUI Li stayed for a moment, slowly put Mr. ghost&rsquo;s body on the ground, and his brain was full of questions?</p>
<p>What does this mean? If you hear it correctly, Mr. ghost&rsquo;s last words should refer to Qingyun Mountain. It&rsquo;s just that Qingyun Mountain stretches for thousands of miles, among which the mountains rise and fall. Where can we start from? Qingyun gate occupies the highest seven peaks. Each peak has a so-called back mountain. But what does it mean to save Qingyun back mountain?</p>
<p>Mr. ghost said that he had generally passed away. After a moment&rsquo;s pondering, he sighed and looked at the dead ghost. Seeing that his eyes were still half open and not closed, he reached out to close his eyes and said in a low voice, &ldquo;if you have a chance to meet a small ring, I&rsquo;ll turn it for you. That&rsquo;s just that you don&rsquo;t have a clue. I&rsquo;m afraid she can&rsquo;t figure it out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, he stood up, looked up at the distance, and saw that most of the red shadow on the Fulong tripod was about to appear. His whole body was as red as blood, but his head was still shrouded in a mass of blood. It was not true. He frowned grimly and didn&rsquo;t want to delay here any more. He turned around and left. Suddenly, his heart moved and his feet were stifled.</p>
<p>At such a moment, an idea suddenly appeared in his heart, like an irresistible temptation.</p>
<p>He turned around and looked again at the body of Mr. ghost who had died. On the black figure, the black veil was still masked. After staring at the black veil for a moment, he suddenly wanted to lift the black veil and see what kind of face it was.</p>
<p>Only a moment later, he finally gave up the idea and turned away.</p>
<p>When GUI Li left the blood pool cave, the little ash lying on his shoulder cried in a low voice. Although he could not bear the four spirits in the blood pool, the place behind him was really the most dangerous dangerous place in the world. Even with his deeds at the moment, GUI Li also asked himself that he had no chance to win against the terrible and terrible mysterious power.</p>
<p>The surrounding stone walls and the ground are still shaking, although knowing that there is a ghost king to protect Biyao, there should be no accident. But GUI Li still had some anxiety in his heart, which was a disaster that he had never met. Obviously, the weird array arranged by the king of ghosts at the moment showed signs of getting rid of control. At least Mr. ghost is the best example.</p>
<p>In any case, even if the ghost king is against it, you&rsquo;d better take Biyao to leave here first!</p>
<p>Huqishan is too dangerous now.</p>
<p>The ghost in the heart so calculated, the figure also speeds up, toward the road to plunder. In a twinkling of an eye, he came to the fork of the road with two entrances. When he was about to steal into the cave, he suddenly suffocated. However, he found that there was a flash of red light in the deep part of the tunnel, which should have been dark, and the red light was moving fast in his direction.</p>
<p>GUI Li moved in his heart, but he didn&rsquo;t know how. He suddenly seemed to be subconscious. He turned around and flashed into another channel. Hiding in a dark corner, with his back against the wall, holding his breath, he quietly held the small ash on his shoulder in his arms and covered his mouth with his hand.</p>
<p>Xiao Hui has a long history of spirituality. She seems to understand something. She is also quiet and crawls in the arms of ghosts.</p>
<p>There was silence in the passage, but the silence didn&rsquo;t last long. After a while, a sudden roar came from the passage. There was a heavy gasp, which somehow sounded like a beast more like a man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pa!&rdquo; A tall figure skimmed through the passage and landed on the ground. From the back, the figure is the king of ghosts. However, the man in front of him at the moment is quite different from that of the ghost king. His clothes are somehow worn out, and his limbs and torso can be seen. There was a strange feeling that it was bigger than usual.</p>
<p>There was a deep &ldquo;crackling&rdquo; sound coming from the ghost king. I didn&rsquo;t know what it was, but there was a very familiar smell from him.</p>
<p>A strong smell of blood!</p>
<p>Looking at the cold figure in the corner!</p>
<p>The ghost king did not stay in the same place for a long time. After falling down, he looked around a little, and then walked to the red light and shadow at the end of the platform. He walked quickly and quickly, as if there was something he was eager for in front of him, so that he did not even carefully check the strange blood stains on the ground around him. When the ghost King&rsquo;s figure disappeared in the cave with the dark red light and shadow flashing, the ghost came out slowly from the dark. He looked at the place, his eyes twinkled, and he didn&rsquo;t know what he was thinking.</p>
<p>Small ash slowly climbed up from his arms, sat on his shoulder, and whispered twice.</p>
<p>The ghost was silent for a moment. Just as he wanted to turn around, he was shocked and his face changed greatly. At present, the land of Huqi mountain was shaking, and the situation was strange and dangerous everywhere. At this time, the ghost king came here alone, and his whole body was obviously full of evil spirits, which was greatly different from ordinary days.</p>
<p>But what about Biyao</p>
<p>At this time, when the ghost king goes to the blood pool, who is going to guard Biyao?</p>
<p>The blood color on the ghostly face instantly faded. It was extremely pale, and there was a buzzing sound in my mind. I dare not have a moment&rsquo;s hesitation. Like lightning, I suddenly jumped up, jumped into the channel, and galloped away.</p>
<p>Along the way, he just kept reading: Biyao Biyao You can&rsquo;t have an accident</p>
<p>The whole Huqi mountain is shaking, which is the feeling of flying in the channel. So far, the duration of the earthquake has far exceeded that of the past, and there is still no sign of stopping at the moment. On the contrary, the feeling from the foot and surrounding stone walls is still intensifying.</p>
<p>Far and near, there was a strange sound of collapse, which was frightening. After the ghost swept out of the dark road and rushed out of the ghost King&rsquo;s stone chamber, the corridor in front of him in the ghost King&rsquo;s clan had been destroyed.</p>
<p>There are stones falling from the stone walls everywhere. The original unimpeded passage has become a crooked path filled with potholes and stones, and more and larger stones are constantly falling from the wall.</p>
<p>From the depths of the mountain rumble strong sound, mixed in the earthquake, more people feel that the unknown terrible.</p>
<p>As GUI Li plundered outward, he soon found that from those channels, countless disciples of the ghost King clan ran recklessly to the exit of the cave like crazy and frightened ants. The old strict rules of the sect lost their full effect at this critical moment, and no one cared about it.</p>
<p>The stream of people converged into a river, and the fierce and anxious pace was soon blocked by the crowd. At such a time, everyone escaped. No one looked at the title of his vice patriarch any more, and no one made way for him.</p>
<p>Besides people, there are still people.</p>
<p>Impatient and fierce stride forward, I don&rsquo;t know who&rsquo;s body in front of me. However, in front of people, they are still human beings, and soon, with their deep and fierce spirit, they also gathered a large number of fleeing guiwangzong disciples</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like an angry little fish in a giant school of deep-sea fish. He struggled and pushed to rush out. However, the crowd he was in was so crowded that people&rsquo;s bodies could be seen from time to time even within a few feet above their heads.</p>
<p>Biyao</p>
<p>Under the feet, there was a sudden and violent vibration, so strong that all the crowd could not help but fall to one side. There were cries of fear and roars, and cries of pain from all directions. In that crazy stream of people, I don&rsquo;t know who fell down and was trampled to death in pain and fear.</p>
<p>Ghostly eyes full of bloodshot, dry mouth, even slightly dizzy in the mind of the feeling, in front of, in front of him, exactly what will be?</p>
<p>Biyao He screamed in his heart.</p>
<p>Finally, as the stream of people crowded through the passage, the ghost turned in a fork in the past. There is quite a distance between the cold ice stone room and the ghost King&rsquo;s stone room. At present, as long as you turn back along this road and go forward to the end. However, GUI Li&rsquo;s body could just turn around and look forward. His body was smothered, and there was a sense of despair on his face.</p>
<p>On this road, countless disciples of the ghost King clan crowded together and tried to rush out. Although the road was slow, it still went ahead with the trend. But at the moment, I have to go against the flow of people. Looking at the faces of people who are almost crazy because of fear, the ghost&rsquo;s heart sank down. People continue to flee in the craziness and despair. Behind the crowd, in the lonely stone chamber, what happened to Yi people? Did they ever get hurt by stones?</p>
<p>Did she see a man scolding and scolding in the crowded crowd, rushing against the current desperately with a kind of madness similar to the fugitives around him, approaching the icestone room where she was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boom</p>
<p>A huge bang burst after the crowd. Under the violent tremor, a huge crack in the stone wall like a broken watermelon peel collapsed and broke away. One of the boulders almost the size of the passage fell down and was in the crowd.</p>
<p>In a flash, the blood flashed and splashed, and more than a dozen people died like this, and the injured were not very common. In addition to the shock, the more frightened crowd rushed forward, and the way of escape was blocked by huge stones. People who were frightened behind the rock gave out a cry of hopeless hope.</p>
<p>Under the boulder, flowing bright red blood, dyed a large area of land.</p>
<p>There was a sense of despair in the crowd, and people were pushing and beating the huge stone. However, the hard and huge rock was not what they could shake. It was still cold and motionless.</p>
<p>Around the earthquake and distant roar, with the smell of death, seems to be getting farther and farther away.</p>
<p>At this moment, the person closest to the boulder suddenly felt a cold air coming from the front. After a moment, the rock burst out continuously and violently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boom With a loud noise, the huge stone was shattered, and large pieces of broken stone fell from the flying dust. However, people were overjoyed, where they could manage so much, they would continue to rush forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cough, cough&hellip;&rdquo; A slight cough came from behind the smoke and dust flying in front of him. A figure seemed to be staggering. The dust fell on his face and shoulders, but he didn&rsquo;t reach out to wipe it. In his pale face, a strange flush appeared.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s terrible.</p>
<p>Welcome him, is a pair of surprise eyes, but no one thanks, everyone in the mind before feeling, once again the idea of escape all occupied, the flow of people have been foolishly moved, the people in front have already run over, see just a crowded scene will happen again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A deafening drink suddenly came out from the ghostly mouth standing in the dust, and the people in front suddenly stopped. At this moment, the so-called vice patriarchal status of GUI Li can no longer restrict them. What they fear is the same threat of death.</p>
<p>The man with blood red eyes held the &ldquo;soul swallowing&rdquo; in his hand, and the blood shining on the &ldquo;blood sucking bead&rdquo; was running to the extreme. The cold intention of killing, like the tide of general, the same cold words, uploaded from his body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who dares to get in my way. The stone just now is the end</p>
<p>The crowd was shaken, the still rolling smoke made everyone believe in the danger, and his eyes with crazy blood red light, people can not ignore his threat, silent. The crowd gave him a narrow road in the crowded passage. It was too small to allow only one person to pass, but it was already the limit.</p>
<p>GUI Li didn&rsquo;t say anything more. He strode to the crowd and ran towards the icy stone room.</p>
<p>Ahead, at the end of the crowd, there is a man waiting for him</p>
<p>Anyway, he must go!</p>
<p>He clenched his teeth.</p>
<p>His lips had already shed thin bloodstains unconsciously, which was a bit terrible. None of the people around him was willing to look him in the eyes. Everyone thought he was a devil.</p>
<p>However, GUI Li didn&rsquo;t care at all. He just ran as hard as he could, pushing away every person in depth. He strode along the narrow and narrow path that seemed to be submerged by the stream of people at any time, and went against the current.</p>
<p>In this world, people who really care. How many?</p>
<p>Suddenly, deep under the ground, there was a huge noise of thunder again, a moment later. Another wave of violent earthquake hit, the stone wall trembled violently, large pieces of rock fell, mercilessly hit the crowd, everywhere is the sound of crying, blink of an eye. That violent tremor has almost made people unable to stand on the ground, and there are so many people who are wandering about. If you like this book, please vote for me in Liancheng Book League.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know who screamed in great fear and rushed forward recklessly. After a moment, all the people did the same thing and completely forgot the other dangers.</p>
<p>In front of the original precarious path, suddenly turned into nothing, countless people flocked to, turned into a terrible torrent, immediately wrapped up in the ghost, desperate to another direction. His left hand suddenly stretched out like a chicken. He immediately grabbed a disciple of the ghost King clan and pulled him to the front of him. At the same time, his right hand was held high to kill him.</p>
<p>In the light red awn, the blood sucking beads twinkle with strange light, illuminating the young face full of fear. He was a teenager. His face was pale, his body was shaking because he was too scared. He had a cold war in his teeth. Only in one eye, he was still shining with a little faint light.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the survival instinct of the desire for life!</p>
<p>At that moment, it seemed to solidify the cold killing intention and the madness in the heart, and the faint light of soul biting twinkling. In the crowd, at the end of the crowd, who was looking from afar?</p>
<p>The bloody red awn, quietly faded from the ghostly eyes, instead, it was the faint tears that released his hand. He let go of the frightened youth, and suddenly roared. The soul devouring spirit rushed out like the wind, breaking the stone and penetrating into the hard stone wall.</p>
<p>The ghost held the soul tightly, attached to the stone wall, and buried his head in the dark.</p>
<p>The stream of people, like a raging tide, surged past his back. Countless bodies squeezed him, pressed him, hit him and rolled him. However, he bore it motionlessly, like a lifeless rock, waiting silently.</p>
<p>The young man was rolled up by the stream of people and rushed forward involuntarily. However, he kept turning back in the turbulent crowd. There was a strange light in his young eyes. Among the crowded people, he tried his best to find the lonely and persevering figure. However, the figure soon disappeared into the sea of people and could not be seen again.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how long, in a frenzy, that terrible escape crowd finally passed. In the scattered smoke and dust, a figure slowly propped up from the stone wall. Just about to take a step, he suddenly felt soft under his feet and nearly fell down.</p>
<p>GUI Li took a deep breath, clenched his teeth, and finally held on. His clothes, especially the parts on his back, were in tattered condition, as if trampled and galloped by countless wild animals. Even with his conduct, his face was extremely pale and ugly.</p>
<p>But he didn&rsquo;t mean to stop and rest. On the contrary, the more anxious he looked, there was no more people escaping in front of him. He walked and ran towards the end of the passage.</p>
<p>Biyao</p>
<p>Somehow, there seems to be some darkness ahead.</p>
<p>He panted and ran through the passage, and the damage of the surrounding stone walls became more and more serious, and there were broken stones everywhere. And these reflected in the eyes of the ghost, just added to his heart anxiety.</p>
<p>Finally, he saw the door of the cold stone room from a distance, but then he was stunned. His face turned pale again. Looking from afar, he clearly remembered that there was a newly installed stone gate at the door, but now it was a piece of rubble scattered on the ground, didn&rsquo;t he</p>
<p>I dare not think about it any more. He just strode away with all his strength.</p>
<p>Suddenly, that is, at the moment when his body was moving, there was no sign at all. The strange rumble and violent earthquake in the deep underground of Huqi mountain suddenly stopped.</p>
<p>One moment there was still a crazy noise around, but the next moment was a strange silence. The contrast was too strong to be accepted.</p>
<p>The fierce body smothered in the air for a while, still ran forward, this sudden silence. In the long passage, only a lonely figure was left, flying towards the deep of the mountain.</p>
<p>And behind him, the deep darkness rose slowly and rolled without a sound.</p>
<p>He rushed to the door of the stone chamber and grasped the hard door frame. The joints were white with force and looked inside.</p>
<p>The world is still and silent. What sound and scene did not exist, his eyes, at the moment, only left in the cold stone room, that empty ice stone platform.</p>
<p>Empty Stone platform!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like all of a sudden I&rsquo;ve been drained of all my strength. His body softened, and the whole world seemed to be spinning and shaking. The only cry echoed in his mind.</p>
<p>Biyao</p>
<p>Stand up in a daze and walk slowly into the stone chamber. Because of the impact of numerous strong earthquakes, the cold stone room has long been devastated. The stone blocks fall on the ground everywhere. The stone walls are cracked on all sides, and there are countless large and small cracks. Even the ground that has been cleaned up at ordinary times has already accumulated a thick layer of dust.</p>
<p>Even near the now empty ice platform, there are more than a dozen large and small falling stones, some of which directly hit the stone platform. In front of me, everything seems to have become a sharp knife, and stabbed at the ghost&rsquo;s heart. He was staggering along, gasping, and tottering.</p>
<p>Of course, the corner of his eye swept over a certain place in the stone chamber, and suddenly it congealed. After a moment, his body began to shake. There was the most damaged corner in the cold stone room. The stones fell down and piled into a hill half a man high. But under the stone dudgel, under a big stone, there was a corner of green clothes.</p>
<p>Green, a dime of clothes</p>
<p>All of a sudden, he rushed over like crazy, threw himself in front of the pile of stones, pushed away the rocks, and dug desperately. The sharp edge of the stones cut his palm bloody, but he seemed to have no feeling at all.</p>
<p>Finally, he moved away from the last and largest Boulder, and then, he was stunned.</p>
<p>Slowly, he squatted down</p>
<p>In front of him, in a green corner.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a green corner.</p>
<p>His eyes moved slowly and looked around the corner of his clothes. On the slowly dusty ground, however, there were many footprints. These footprints were large and small, but he knew clearly that these things should not have appeared here.</p>
<p>In the cold ice stone room, he and the ghost King were the only ones who could come. However, some other people who could come, such as Mr. ghost, were either with him or not in Huqi mountain at the moment.</p>
<p>So why would anyone sneak into this place when it was so chaotic and everyone was running for their lives?</p>
<p>The next moment, the face suddenly pale, almost subconscious, he has thought of the answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Albizzia bell&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In the demon religion, everyone knows that the Huanhuan bell is a rare magic treasure. It can even be compared with the blood sucking beads of the black hearted old man in the heyday of the demon cult. Under the greed, is it</p>
<p>GUI Li didn&rsquo;t think about it any more. His mind was blank for a moment.</p>
<p>Deep in the heart, something quietly broke, smashed, it is the last trace of support to maintain his heart, thin and weak gossamer, but bear a heavy burden.</p>
<p>What, nothing</p>
<p>Finally, there is nothing</p>
<p>Like a dream, he suddenly appeared in his mind that a green figure, the smile is always so beautiful and gentle. The body is getting colder and colder. The chill comes from all directions. Only the figure is warm, and the smile is the last warmth in his heart. Just, slowly, the body light, gradually fade away. Even the remaining warmth slowly disappeared</p>
<p>The stillness and coldness of death, like the icy tide of nowhere in my memory, came and swallowed him up.</p>
<p>Biyao</p>
<p>The last name he called in his heart.</p>
<p>The next moment. He fainted, his whole body fell down heavily and fell on the ground, smashing a few dust.</p>
<p>There was no one in the cave of ghost King&rsquo;s cave at the moment. In a strange silence, suddenly, there was an earth shaking sound from the deep underground of Huqi mountain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boom</p>
<p>In a flash, the whole Huqi mountain began to shake violently. A huge force was raging and fermenting from the depths of the earth. Everywhere, the stone walls were collapsing, and countless ground was splitting. This time, the cracks in those cracks were filled with terrible red light.</p>
<p>The smell of blood permeates every corner.</p>
<p>More and more ground, as if unable to resist the erosion of the terrible force, have collapsed, the red light is more and more prosperous. It got bigger and bigger. Later, even the whole stone wall collapsed and fell down. Fell into the red light and shadow.</p>
<p>Terrible roar and crazy laughter, as if the devil resurrected from the abyss, echoed in the depths of the red shadow.</p>
<p>Gradually, a huge deep hole was formed, and red blood shoots out of the big hole, and around the edge of the deep hole. There are more and more ground stones collapsing, expanding this unnecessarily deep hole.</p>
<p>In the distant cold stone chamber, the stone walls on the ground were shaking violently, and stones were falling down continuously. Some of them hit the body of the devil, but his body was still and did not respond. Outside the stone chamber, the terrible power in the distance seems to be coming towards here step by step. At this moment, all of a sudden, a white figure appeared at the door of the cold stone room, which was Xiaobai. Her brow frowned tightly and her face was solemn. She took a look at the stone chamber. When she saw that there was nothing over the stone platform, her face turned pale. Then she saw that she fainted on the other side of the stone chamber.</p>
<p>Without more hesitation, Xiaobai has already rushed over and pulled his fierce body over. What appears in front of her is a pale and hopeless face with cold tentacles, which almost makes Xiaobai think that he is holding a dead man.</p>
<p>She clenched her teeth and swept the corner of her eyes. Suddenly, she saw that the ghost was holding on to something tightly, but it was a fragment of broken green clothes. Her heart turned slightly. She had already understood seven or eight points, and her eyes were red.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boom! Boom! Boom!&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>However, the cruelty of the world does not even allow them to have time to grieve. At the bottom of Huqi mountain, a crazy sound broke out again. After a violent shaking, Xiaobai suddenly felt that the ground under his feet was slowly collapsing in the shaking, and the red light gushed out from the cracks in the ground under his feet, with extremely hot airflow.</p>
<p>At the foot of the flow, as if it was the hottest magma.</p>
<p>Xiaobai&rsquo;s surprise was quite remarkable. He took a light drink and lifted the ghost&rsquo;s body. His feet were on a falling stone. He had already flown out of the cold ice stone room, and only went out for a moment. The cold stone room had collapsed and fell into the terrible red awn.</p>
<p>But after going out, Xiaobai&rsquo;s face turned pale again. The scene outside was worse than that in the cold stone room. The huge pit had been expanding faster and faster. Now, not only the ground, but also the surrounding stone walls and even the boulders on the top of the head had fallen down one after another. Xiaobai was jumping and galloping among the remaining stones, and occasionally looking down, he saw the endless red light below Incomparably, as expected, a large amount of magma was caught in the blood and flowed violently.</p>
<p>There are less and less places to settle down, and the rest is also rapidly collapsing. Xiaobai clenches his teeth and flies with his fierce body. At this critical moment of life and death, Xiaobai suddenly felt a faint light on her head. She looked up quickly and saw that there was originally a thick rock layer on top of her head. After large pieces of collapse, in the scene of the end of the day when huge stones fell like rain, there was a little narrow gap that showed the light of the sky.</p>
<p>Is it the whole Huqi mountain liquor collapsed, showing a hole on it?</p>
<p>On the small white face, there was a trace of resolute color, and the foot was a little bit heavier. On the last remaining supporting rock, it jumped up and flew upward. At the foot, the stone finally collapsed and fell into the red shadow, and there was no way out.</p>
<p>The red and hot magma, like an angry giant, began to roar, slowly surged up, churning and stirring. Under the magma, it seemed that there was a huge force urging it. After a moment, the hot magma exploded, turned into a huge torrent and rushed upward.</p>
<p>The white figure is in a crazy scene, under which there is a fiery torrent of magma. On the cotton yarn, there are huge falling stone fragments which are dense like raindrops. Xiaobai, like a white bird, flutters its wings and flies through the storm of mining industry and flies to the sky desperately.</p>
<p>Heaven and earth change color, black clouds roll.</p>
<p>It used to be the highest mountain within a hundred miles. At this moment, Huqi mountain slowly collapsed in a loud noise and smoke.</p>
<p>The earth is shaking violently, as if that force, even heaven and earth are afraid of it.</p>
<p>In the roar, in the smoke and dust which is hundreds of feet high, the huge hot magma flood directly rushed out from the underground and sprayed into the sky. Under the magnificent and terrible scene of the giant force of heaven and earth, a small white figure was near the huge lava flood. At the last moment, it finally flew away from the mountain pass of hell and flew to the distance. (to be continued. )</p>
