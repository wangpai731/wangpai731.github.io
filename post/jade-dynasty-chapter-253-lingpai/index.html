      <p>The vast land of Shenzhou, the vast mountains, and the fertile land of central China, still seem to be a peaceful scene at this time, and there is no sense of the strange occurrence of the remote mountains in the southwest border.</p>
<p>However, at the moment, there are two people flying to Huqi mountain, where the former general Hall of the ghost King clan was located. It was the former secret who sneaked into Qingyun Mountain and secretly broke the &ldquo;tianjilock&rdquo; of jinpinger and Cangsong Taoist.</p>
<p>After they secretly destroyed the lock of the four peaks of Qingyun gate, they made a careful exploration around Qingyun Mountain according to the instructions of the ghost King earlier. It took several days before they came back. Taoist Cangsong was silent all the way. Sometimes it was hard for them to say a word all day. Jinpinger understood more or less the ambivalence of Taoist Cangsong, but knew how to return I know that she is not a soft hearted and kind-hearted woman. On the contrary, although she still smiles and smiles all day long, she actually looks down on Taoist Cangsong.</p>
<p>On the way back, they entered the hundred Li realm of Huqi mountain, and after a day&rsquo;s driving, they fell back from the sky to the ground, and found a quiet valley to have a rest. The valley is not big. Among the mountains, there is a small stream flowing down from the upper reaches, passing through the bottom of the valley and going down the mountain. The water in the stream was clear. After a day&rsquo;s driving, Jin pinger felt thirsty for a long time. When he went to the stream, he took some water in his hand and drank it in his mouth.</p>
<p>The water in the valley is cold, but the entrance is very sweet. The Golden Vase can&rsquo;t help but drink a few more mouthfuls. Then she takes a breath and looks back with a smile: &ldquo;Taoist priest, the stream is quite good. Would you like to have a drink?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taoist Cangsong sat on a stone beside him and shook his head. His face was rather gloomy. In fact, he has been like this since he came back from Qingyun Mountain. The Golden Vase son looked in his eyes and laughed in his heart, but he was too lazy to say anything. He turned around and held the clear stream in his hands. He splashed a few times on his face, then raised his head and swung it. He only felt a cool feeling on his face, which was indescribable.</p>
<p>Under the sun. The crystal water drops on her white skin looked like pearls, slowly sliding down. Her chest was splashed a little wet by a few drops of water, showing a touch of tender skin, which showed her own enchanting beauty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss gold.&rdquo; Suddenly. The Taoist Cangsong, who had been silent behind him, suddenly called out.</p>
<p>Jinpinger didn&rsquo;t expect that the Cangsong Taoist who always looked like a Muggle would take the initiative to speak.</p>
<p>A little strange in her heart, she turned around to look at it and showed her signature charming smile. She said with a smile, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter, Taoist priest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taoist Cangsong&rsquo;s eyes drooped slightly. He did not look at the beautiful face of jinpinger, which was enough to overturn all living beings. He frowned slightly. It seemed that he had put a lot of heavy burden on his mind. After a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, he only heard him say: &ldquo;the Lord of ghosts ordered us to secretly destroy the Tianji lock of Qingyun gate. I know the purpose of this, demon sect&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>In the middle of his speech, he suddenly choked. The Golden Vase looked at him with a smile, but his eyes seemed to have some sarcasm.</p>
<p>Taoist Cangsong was silent for a moment and said in a low voice: &quot; In order to dominate the world, Qingyun gate is naturally the number one enemy. Breaking their natural mechanism lock is the most important thing. But I don&rsquo;t understand why the Lord of ghosts asked us to inspect all the towns and villages within a hundred miles of Qingyun gate. And the people who live there. These people are unarmed ordinary people. Even those who respect Qingyun gate on weekdays, it seems that they are not enough to ask the holy religion to deal with them? &quot;</p>
<p>The Golden Vase turns her eyes. Smiling, he said, &ldquo;why, is it that the Taoist priest has a sense of compassion for all living beings?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taoist Cangsong&rsquo;s face sank and said, &ldquo;I just think it&rsquo;s OK to deal with Qingyun gate. If you want to involve these innocent people, you don&rsquo;t have to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Golden Vase son said with a smile, &ldquo;Taoist priest, why are you angry. I didn&rsquo;t say anything After a moment&rsquo;s meditation, she said, &ldquo;to be honest, the investigation of the towns around Qingyun Mountain was ordered by the Lord of the ghost king. I don&rsquo;t know why. But in my opinion, with the demeanor of the Lord of ghost king, it doesn&rsquo;t look like a madman who slaughters the people for no reason?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taoist Cangsong looked a little slower and thought for a moment. He seemed to think that the Golden Vase was reasonable. However, he seemed to have some scruples. He shook his head and said, &ldquo;even so, I still can&rsquo;t understand why we should check the ordinary people. Apart from the large number of them, there are other unusual places. Those common people, even if hundreds and thousands of them come together, are not a successful opponent of practicing Taoism. &quot;</p>
<p>Jin pinger said with a smile: &ldquo;we all want to know this layer. The Lord of the ghost king is as deep as the sea. How can we not understand it? So, Taoist priest, you don&rsquo;t have to worry about things. &quot;</p>
<p>Cangsong Taoist priest sighed and said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s because the spirit of the Lord of the ghost king is as deep as the sea. I can&rsquo;t guess what he&rsquo;s thinking at all. Although it&rsquo;s common sense, I&rsquo;m afraid he&rsquo;ll suddenly&hellip;&rdquo; After that, he seemed to feel a little bored. He laughed bitterly, shook his head and stopped talking.</p>
<p>However, Jin Pinger is not the kind of person who would worry about the lives of countless people at the foot of Qingyun Mountain, but the strange attitude of Taoist Cangsong. In her heart, she was somewhat dissatisfied. She didn&rsquo;t know what her future fate was. She was still worried about other people? Can it be that these guys who come out of the right way have this temper? Even if they join the demon sect, they can&rsquo;t change it.</p>
<p>Jin pinger shrugged her shoulders and was puzzled by this strange thing. She turned around and went back to the stream. She wanted to wash her face before she left here and went on her way. She said faintly, &ldquo;Taoist priest, don&rsquo;t worry about it. What can I do for you&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before the word &ldquo;Mo&rdquo; was uttered, the Golden Vase&rsquo;s eyes suddenly fixed. The word seemed to be stuck and could not speak any more. Even her body seemed to be stiff.</p>
<p>In the clear and bottomless stream, suddenly there was a lot of blood, dark red, in the stream with the flow, slowly rippling away. Looking at the blood color, the golden vase&rsquo;er&rsquo;s face suddenly became ugly. He thought that he had just drunk the water here and washed his face with water. The golden bottle&rsquo;er had a convulsion in his stomach and felt like he wanted to vomit.</p>
<p>She stood there and looked at it silently for a while. Her eyes moved. She looked along the bloodstain to the upstream of the stream. Sure enough, the blood was slowly flowing down from the upstream. In the stream like a thin red line, continuous.</p>
<p>Hum, walk up the stream to the cold bottle.</p>
<p>Behind his back, Cangsong Taoist saw the Golden Vase son suddenly walk away, some strange, way: &ldquo;gold girl, what&rsquo;s the matter with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the Golden Vase did not answer him. A pair of eyes just staring at the stream, Cangsong Taoist frowned, came over, and then his face changed slightly. After a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, he followed the Golden Vase and walked upstream.</p>
<p>The stream is not deep and not big. People can walk down to the other side of the river only by knee, and they can walk across three or four steps. But the water gurgling, winding flow, actually quite long, two people walked in the valley for a short half an hour, they were about to walk out of the valley, the stream actually did not end, and the water that strange blood red line, also has been extending.</p>
<p>Jinpinger and Cangsong Taoist looked at each other and frowned. They were both extraordinary figures. Naturally, we know that if the blood of ordinary human beings and animals flows in the water, it will flow along the river if it flows in the water, but if it is such a long distance, it will be invisible in the water. At present, the blood in the water is still coagulating, but it must be strange.</p>
<p>Among the mountains, the wind through the valley, sounded a strange whistling sound, the mountains shaking, issued a strange sound. It&rsquo;s a little more somber.</p>
<p>Cangsong Taoist suddenly stopped. The Golden Vase frowned and looked at him, saying, &ldquo;how?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taoist Cangsong was silent for a moment. &ldquo;I think we&rsquo;d better not get into trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Golden Vase son eyebrows a pick, it seems that Cangsong Taoist will say such words, way: &ldquo;Taoist priest, you should not be afraid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cangsong Taoist priest&rsquo;s anger flashed over his face, but he was still patient. He said, &ldquo;great things matter. The Lord of the ghost king has told us to do things for some time. I think it&rsquo;s better to go back and report first. &quot; After that, he didn&rsquo;t wait for Jin Ping&rsquo;er to talk. He didn&rsquo;t want to see the sarcastic look of Jin Ping&rsquo;er, but he turned around, but he flew away to Huqi mountain.</p>
<p>Looking at the figure of Taoist Cangsong flying away, Jin Ping&rsquo;er snorted coldly. Her eyes were quite contemptuous. She was too lazy to chase after her. She turned her head and looked at the bloodstain in the stream. Slowly, her face became somewhat dignified.</p>
<p>Suddenly, in the open valley, there was a low roar in the distance from the upper reaches of the stream. The Golden Vase was thinking intently. He was startled by the sudden cry. He turned around to see that there was a forest ahead, and the stream turned a bend at the edge of the forest, but the place where the call came from was blocked by the dense forest.</p>
<p>Now that she is here, Jin pinger will not ignore it. With a light jump, she has already swept past quietly, and has not entered the dense forest. After several jumps, she jumps up a branch at the edge of the forest and looks down.</p>
<p>At this glance, her face suddenly changed.</p>
<p>Cangsong Taoist priest flew in the air, but he slowed down his speed and waited for a long time. Unexpectedly, the Golden Vase didn&rsquo;t catch up. Taoist Cangsong looked at the empty behind him and couldn&rsquo;t help feeling angry. The Golden Vase Er always calls &ldquo;long and long&rdquo; in his polite conversation with him. However, Taoist Cangsong, who has a deep understanding of the world, has long seen that there is a trace of disdain and ridicule in his eyes.</p>
<p>Or maybe Jin pinger didn&rsquo;t mean to ridicule, but Taoist Cangsong thought so. It&rsquo;s no wonder Taoist Cangsong has become so sensitive since he betrayed Qingyun and joined the ghost King sect.</p>
<p>After Cang song Dao&rsquo;s life was sulky, he hesitated whether he should go alone or go back to find the Golden Vase. A light purple light came from behind, but the Golden Vase flew over.</p>
<p>The magic weapon&rsquo;s light flashed, and Jin pinger came to Cang song Taoist. The wind in the air made her dress hunt and dance. But at this moment, she looked thoughtful and didn&rsquo;t have the usual smile.</p>
<p>Looking at the Taoist Cangsong waiting there, Jin pinger smiles at him, but it seems that the smile is a little reluctant. It is not her usual charming color and says, &ldquo;Taoist priest, let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cangsong Taoist priest snorted coldly, turned to control the sword and continued to move on, without even saying a word. In the face of some rude behavior, Jin pinger didn&rsquo;t get angry on her face. On the contrary, she kept up slowly behind her back and looked at the figure of Cang song Taoist priest flying away in front of her, but her eyes showed a twinkling complex look.</p>
<p>The valley is still a hundred miles away from Huqi mountain, and the mountains rise and fall. Ordinary people who want to cross the mountain are afraid to walk for at least half a month. However, it is only half a day for Cangsong blade and jinpinger who can control the sword.</p>
<p>But when they flew near the Huqi mountain yesterday, they were like a punch in front of them. Even the Golden Vase, who had been thinking about it, was too frightened to speak. As they slowly lowered down, everything in front of them gradually became clear. The once towering Huqi mountain has disappeared at the moment. On the huge mountain site, a huge abyss suddenly appears, in which you can hear the roar of fiery magma running. And from the abyss radiated countless strange red blood, shooting into the sky, such as the image of the legendary devil.</p>
<p>There was a strong and pungent smell of blood in the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter? What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; Cangsong Taoist murmured.</p>
<p>Fall to the ground. Taoist Cangsong looked around, and saw that the abyss was surrounded by strange red light and shadow. The forest with luxuriant leaves was withered at the moment, leaving only withered trunks standing in place. The situation was terrible.</p>
<p>Cang song Taoist Drama around, is from fear, suddenly came around the voice of the Golden Vase son, just listen to her gently &ldquo;Yi&rdquo;. Quite a bit surprised. Cangsong Taoist looked at her and saw the Golden Vase&rsquo;s hand pointing right in front of her, and whispered, &ldquo;look there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taoist Cangsong looked along the direction of her finger, but she was also stunned. She saw that the red light and shadow in that direction shook, but dozens of people came out of the red shadow. They were strong men with clothes and accessories, and the clothes of the ghost King sect of the devil sect. It seems that they are all disciples of the ghost King sect.</p>
<p>Taoist Cangsong gave a sigh of relief. It seems that Hu Qishan has indeed undergone great changes during the period of his leaving. However, if you want to use the power of the ghost king, there is nothing he can do. Looking at these disciples of the ghost King sect, it is estimated that the spirit of the ghost King sect is not seriously hurt.</p>
<p>At this time, a group of guiwangzong disciples who looked a little like patrolling around also found two people standing here. They both turned their direction and came here. Taoist Cangsong met him and said in a loud voice, &ldquo;I am Cangsong. What&rsquo;s going on here? &quot;</p>
<p>Jin pinger did not speak. She took a deep look at the red blood shadow in the distance, which was shaped like a mask over the abyss. Then she silently followed the Taoist Cangsong, her brows locked and her eyes fixed on the approaching disciples of the ghost King sect.</p>
<p>When the people on both sides approached, the dozens of them were indeed the disciples of the ghost King sect, one of the leaders</p>
<p>He nodded to Cang song and gave him a gift. However, his movements were somewhat stiff and said: &ldquo;yes, I have Er Taoist priest&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>Taoist Cangsong frowned. The tone of the ghost King sect disciple&rsquo;s speech was rather strange. With his stiff movements, he seemed to be a wooden man. He did not know where he was transferred from. He was so strange.</p>
<p>However, Taoist Cangsong didn&rsquo;t bother to take care of these things. He said, &ldquo;where is the Lord of the ghost king? We have something to report to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The disciple of the ghost King sect was still in the appearance of a pair of Mona, slowly turned to point to the end of the red light and said, &ldquo;Lord, er, inside, er I&rsquo;ve been waiting for you for a long time What about it. &quot;</p>
<p>Cangsong Taoist elder brother&rsquo;s impatience, listening to people say a word is really to waste the spirit of the boss, the next wave, way: &ldquo;OK, you lead the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The disciple of the ghost King clan nodded, turned and walked away, slowly saying, &ldquo;yes Er &quot;</p>
<p>The group went back to the abyss. Taoist Cangsong wanted to ask what happened to the sudden great change. However, the conversation just now completely eliminated his patience. It was just as painful to ask such a Muna ghost King disciple. He might as well ask the ghost King leader later.</p>
<p>Jinpinger followed them and walked slowly, gazing at the disciples of the ghost King sect around them. At first, they were not different from ordinary people except that their movements were slightly stiff. I can&rsquo;t see anything strange at all, but the color of vigilance in Golden Vase&rsquo;s eyes is more and more strong.</p>
<p>As he approached the abyss and was getting closer to the red blood, Jin Ping&rsquo;er suddenly found that a faint red color appeared in the eyes of the ghost King sect disciples walking beside him, just like the red blood. However, the movements of all of them were not stiff at the beginning, but gradually became brisk.</p>
<p>It seemed as if some strength had been given to them in the blood red light and shadow.</p>
<p>It was getting closer and closer to the strange red mask. It was only two long distances. Taoist Cangsong suddenly felt a little uneasy. However, he couldn&rsquo;t tell what the sudden feeling was. At this moment, a light cry came from behind. People turned around and saw that the Golden Vase, which was still in good condition, suddenly sat down on the ground and covered his heart with his hands , wheezing and coughing, his face turned pale. It looks very painful.</p>
<p>This is her intuition.</p>
<p>Jin Ping&rsquo;er&rsquo;s breathing became louder and louder. The two ghost King&rsquo;s disciples standing beside her seemed indifferent and indifferent to things outside her, but after a moment. Suddenly, behind them came a strange sound, as if some stone had hit the ground. The Golden Vase was facing the direction of the strange sound, and then his face changed greatly. He stood up and lost his voice and said, &ldquo;what, why are you here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two disciples of the ghost King clan were surprised. They could not help turning around to look at the Golden Vase. However, after they turned around, they saw nothing behind them, not to mention the figure of a human being, not even the shadow of a stone. It&rsquo;s just like hell. The two men, zhanger and monk, are confused. They just want to ask jinpinger. Unexpectedly, the jinpinger who was standing behind them has disappeared. It is as if it has never appeared in this place, leaving only an empty piece of land.</p>
<p>The two ghost King disciples were surprised and looked at each other, and then they all cried out, but the sound of shouting was not human at all. More like two wild animals roaring, in situ earned two laps, two people then turned to rush into the red blood light shadow.</p>
<p>In the distance, the Golden Vase appeared slowly behind a human stone. Just now, getting rid of the seemingly simple, she has exhausted all her wit and conduct, until now. He just slowly breathed a sigh of relief, also just realized that his forehead is full of cold sweat.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just before she relaxes. Suddenly, in the red light and shadow, there was a scream of pain. The voice was from Taoist Cangsong. When Jin pinger was shocked, she immediately turned around and hid behind the stone. Although the voice was sharp and sharp, it soon weakened and disappeared. Then there was a roar of wild laughter, which was full of crazy meaning, as if in this world All things will step on his feet, and the mountains will shake and reverberate.</p>
<p>The Golden Vase son looks pale, the body actually starts to tremble slightly, although this voice has the variation, but she clearly understands, it is the ghost King&rsquo;s laughter.</p>
<p>Thousands of miles away, Qingyun Mountain leads to Tianfeng and the ancestral hall of the back mountain.</p>
<p>It is still as peaceful as ever, and the majestic hall is situated in the woods and exudes a solemn atmosphere. The forest is quiet and the birds are singing. From afar, you can see the incense in the shadow of the dim ancestral hall.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu looked up at the sky. The sky above him was blue and cloudless. The warm sunshine shone on him. With the warm warmth of the ocean, he reflected the beautiful changing light from the green dragon sword pinned to his waist.</p>
<p>It looks like a nice day today.</p>
<p>He looked at it for a while, his mouth slowly showed a smile that he had not seen for a long time. Then he took up the broom in his hand and began to clean the stone step space in front of the ancestral hall.</p>
<p>Since the mysterious comer passed away, Qingyun Mountain has been changed several times. However, under the drastic changes, no one noticed this secluded corner long ago. However, Lin Jingyu seems to be very nostalgic for this place, perhaps for the old man. In short, many people acquiesce in it unconsciously. Lin Jingyu became the successor to guard the ancestral hall.</p>
<p>The yellow leaves rolled up one after another under the wave of the broom, and were swept aside. Lin Jingyu was quietly cleaning, doing what he had to do every day.</p>
<p>The mountain forest is quiet and the breeze is relaxed, but I don&rsquo;t know that such a career can be more peaceful than in the past.</p>
<p>Just this day, but it seems destined not to be calm.</p>
<p>Quietly, just as Lin Jingyu was concentrating on sweeping the fallen leaves on the ground, his feet suddenly appeared in front of him. Lin Jingyu was surprised. If it was not the time for ancestor worship, no one would come here in Qingyun gate for several months. Today is an ordinary day that can&rsquo;t be popularized. How can anyone come?</p>
<p>He looked up. Unexpectedly, he was even more surprised at this sight, which shocked his whole body. He actually stepped back a step, and his face changed color. He was shocked and said, &ldquo;Master Zhang, master Shibo!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Standing in front of him, he was astonished to be the Taoist priest of Qingyun gate who had been missing for many days.</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan was still wearing that dark green Taoist robe, but some parts of it showed signs of dilapidation. In the past, it could not be imagined that it would happen to the famous master of Qingyun gate. At the moment, daoxuan&rsquo;s real face is expressionless, seems to be thinner than the memory, as if a little more vicissitudes.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu is extremely confused. Although he is not the core member of Qingyun gate, and has no insight into the inside story than the master and apprentice of Shuiyue on xiaozhufeng, he was present at that day when there was a conflict between daoxuan immortal and Tian Buyi in the ancestral hall, but both of them disappeared. Now tianbuyi has passed away, but daoxuan immortal will come here quietly. The twists and turns are strange, which makes people feel cold.</p>
<p>But although Lin Jingyu is astonished here. However, the Taoist immortal over there seemed to pay no attention to him. His eyes only stayed on Lin Jingyu for a moment and then looked at the grand ancestral hall.</p>
<p>Taoist real man looked at the palace for a long time, and suddenly said slowly, &ldquo;are you alone here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu was stunned for a moment. Nodding: &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan took a glance at him. Suddenly, his eyes were suspicious, but he fell on the dragon sword on Lin Jingyu&rsquo;s waist. Although the ancients left, it still had its unique arrogance.</p>
<p>Green light reflected in his eyes, daoxuan real man&rsquo;s face also changed, slowly emerged a confused expression of meditation, Lin Jingyu at the moment confused.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I should leave for the front mountain and report to the teachers of tongtianfeng, or should I continue to watch here?</p>
<p>However, the immortal XuanZhen didn&rsquo;t give him much time to think. His strange look soon disappeared and replaced by another kind of indifference. He faintly surprised Lin and said, &ldquo;you are here. No one else is allowed to come in without my command.&rdquo; Then, without waiting for Lin Jingyu to answer, he strode to the dark hall of the ancestral hall.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu is stunned in situ, at a loss. Can only see the shadow of daoxuan real person disappear in the dark.</p>
<p>After entering the inner hall, after the initial darkness, the huge offering table on the main hall and the numerous spiritual cards behind the offering table appeared in front of Taoist immortal daoxuan. A solemn and solemn atmosphere came to him. The ancestors of Qingyun gate are here, coldly and silently watching the figure of daoxuan immortal.</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan&rsquo;s body trembled slightly. It seemed that something happened in his body, which made him very painful. But he soon put up with it and walked slowly to the altar. He took the sandalwood from the offering table and lit it on a candle nearby. He went to the front of the offering table and knelt down slowly in front of the spirit throne of the ancestors.</p>
<p>In the dark light, his face also seems to be cloudy and sunny, but the warmth of the little incense, floating light smoke.</p>
<p>His voice is low and hoarse. His hands are holding incense, but he seems to be shaking gently. He seems to be very excited in his heart, so that he can&rsquo;t speak any more.</p>
<p>He buried his head deeply and crawled in front of numerous tablets. In the spacious and magnificent hall, the wind blew, and the cloth curtain around him began to flutter gently. Even the candles on the offering table began to fade.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the body of immortal daoxuan trembled suddenly, and he didn&rsquo;t know how to exert himself. The three sandalwood in his hand were suddenly eroded by great force, and they were silent in an instant. At the moment, a mass of black gas spread out from the real man daoxuan, rapidly turning and expanding, and it seemed that he was going to cover him completely.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu, standing outside the main hall, seems to have some sense. Frown up, can not help but toward the direction of the hall he further. Deep in the shadow, a strange smell rose suddenly. Among them, the spirit of evil was very heavy, which was not originally owned by the ancestral temple.</p>
<p>The strange face of Taoist immortal flashed in his mind. He felt uneasy. But looking at the grand hall, he hesitated.</p>
<p>The mountain forest is quiet, but around the ancestral temple, the sound of birds has disappeared in a flash. It seems that the birds also feel the inexplicable danger, and they are silent like cicadas.</p>
<p>In the hall, Taoist immortal&rsquo;s body trembled more and more, and the black air around him became more and more thick. In the original silent hall, I don&rsquo;t know when there was a whirlwind, making a deep whine, blowing rapidly in the open hall. The wind is getting stronger and stronger. Daoxuan real man&rsquo;s body was shaking, under the shadow of black air, slowly stood up. At this time, his face seemed to be suddenly changed into a person, full of violent air.</p>
<p>But when you look closely, there is another color of pain in daoxuan&rsquo;s eyes behind the violence, so that her face is distorted, as if he has been trying to endure something, but looking at the situation, it is obviously gradually unable to support.</p>
<p>At this strange and critical juncture, the strange wind around him became stronger and stronger. Not only did the heavy offering table begin to retreat slightly, but even the distant incense case token behind the offering table was also affected. Many magic cards were shaking in the strong wind. There are some more signs of falling.</p>
<p>As a Taoist immortal in the Qingyun gate, it can be said that he has been rebellious when he collides with the spirit of the founder like this. It&rsquo;s just his face. The anger is getting heavier and heavier. How can you care about this.</p>
<p>It was at this time that suddenly only a &ldquo;pa&rdquo; sound was heard. Sure enough, under the strong wind, a magic card placed on the edge of the corner of the incense table could not hold up. Fell down, fell on the floor stones, issued a crisp sound.</p>
<p>The voice seemed to have startled the real man daoxuan who was supporting himself. He turned his head subconsciously and suddenly, somehow, his whole body was shocked like a basin of cold water. The fierce expression quickly receded, and the strange black air disappeared without knowing how. On his face, there was only regret and sadness.</p>
<p>Under the dim light. The magic card that fell to the ground lay there quietly, motionless. On the wooden card, it was a blank.</p>
<p>This is an empty card without words.</p>
<p>That piece of blank, also seems to be staring at him coldly.</p>
<p>Taoist immortal&rsquo;s lips trembled slightly, staring at the blank spirit tablet. Then he slowly walked past, picked up the tablet and touched it carefully in his hand</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how long after that, his hoarse and slightly choked voice came from the dark: &ldquo;younger martial brother&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Outside the ancestral temple, Lin Jingyu was so anxious that his forehead was sweating, and he fought countless times in his heart. Finally, a ruthless, ready to rush in regardless of everything to see what happened in the ancestral hall, who knows that in the moment he is about to jump up, the strange atmosphere in the ancestral hall suddenly disappeared.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu was surprised and uneasy. After all, no matter what, the person in the ancestral hall is the Qingyun gate. In the past, he saved lives several times, not to mention the common people. Even ordinary disciples of Qingyun sect, including Lin Jingyu, regard him as a fairy.</p>
<p>This hesitation is a long time to wait. Lin Jingyu has never felt that time has passed so slowly. Even though he has been alone in the face of the lonely ancestral hall in the open and barren mountains, he does not feel like he is now. But until he began to doubt whether his practice was not enough, the figure of daoxuan real man appeared at the gate of the hall again.</p>
<p>His expression is still so expressionless, he slowly walked down, and did not look at Lin Jingyu much. Lin Jingyu did not know why, maybe he was photographed in the past power of immortal daoxuan, and he did not dare to ask more questions, so he quietly stepped aside.</p>
<p>When daoxuan passed by, he stopped for a moment. After a while, he only heard him say in a low voice</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take care of him We</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu was stunned. He didn&rsquo;t know who they were in daoxuan&rsquo;s real population. However, since the ancestral temple came out just now, it must have been the spiritual positions of the ancestors of Qingyun gate in the ancestral hall. He nodded and said respectfully, &ldquo;I know that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan took a deep look at him. He looked at Lin Jingyu&rsquo;s green sword, which was shining on his waist. He suddenly gave a bitter smile and said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s really like&hellip;!&rdquo; ;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu didn&rsquo;t understand for a moment. When he looked up to ask questions clearly, he saw that the real man daoxuan had already gone. Looking at his direction, he was heading for the most important forbidden area in Qingyun gate, the magic moon cave. Lin Jingyu hesitated for a moment, and finally decided to take a look at the ancestral temple. He turned around and picked up the broom that had just been thrown on the ground and walked into the ancestral hall.</p>
<p>When he looked around, he saw that everything in the hall was the same as before. It seemed that there was no change. He frowned and went to the table where the ancestors were worshipped. There are three newly lit sandalwood in a small bronze incense burner on the offering table. They are burning quietly with a faint smell of sandalwood.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, his eyes fixed, but he saw that there was a Lingpai position too close to the edge of the case. He frowned. These days, he arranged here all day and was familiar with the location of the trump card. So he soon found that the spirit tablet seemed to have been passive. If the disciples of Qingyun gate make false moves to the ancestral throne, this crime is not small</p>
<p>He shook his head slightly, went over, picked up the Lingpai, just wanted to put it back into the incense table, suddenly his body was shocked, and his eyes could no longer leave the tablet in his hand.</p>
<p>I can see that the Lingpai is not like other tablets with names and titles written in gold paint, because it was originally a blank tablet, but now on the Lingpai in Lin Jingyu&rsquo;s hand, there is a line of words: the spirit throne of one thousand swords in Qingyun gate!</p>
<p>This line of characters, brilliant red, was written with blood! (to be continued). )</p>
