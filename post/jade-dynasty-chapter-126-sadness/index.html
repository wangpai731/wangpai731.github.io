      <p>The flaming flame lights up the sky, and the gorgeous brilliance will shine like the day, even if it is a hundred miles away, you can still hear the roaring sound.</p>
<p>Looking at the distant place where the flashing red light and fireballs interweave, a group of people stopped in amazement.</p>
<p>More than one official in the burning incense Valley, led by Li Xun and Lv Shun, together with Lu Xueqi of Qingyun gate and FA Xiang of Tianyin temple, were watching the disorderly place on the ancient road 100 li away from qilidong.</p>
<p>Li Xun frowned: &ldquo;it seems that something has happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Looking into the distance, FA Xiang said in a deep voice, &ldquo;the fire is so evil that it&rsquo;s very strange. I&rsquo;m afraid there&rsquo;s evil in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li Xun turned his head and looked at Lu Xueqi standing on the side. Seeing that the woman was still indifferent and silent, he said to Shangguan: &ldquo;what should I do, uncle Shangguan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the same time, both FA Xiang and the others looked at shangguance, and saw that Shangguan cezheng looked far away, but his face suddenly became very strange, like astonishment and amazement.</p>
<p>At this time, Li Xun&rsquo;s question seemed to wake up suddenly. His body was shocked, and then his expression returned to normal. He murmured: &ldquo;since it&rsquo;s a demon, we are duty bound to go. It&rsquo;s not too late. We&rsquo;ll rush to see the flame rising. I&rsquo;m afraid that the demon&rsquo;s moral conduct is not low and the poison is deeper. We can save a lot of lives by the moment we arrive. &quot;</p>
<p>The law coincides with ten ways: &ldquo;Shangguan Shishu said yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shangguan CE nodded and said, &ldquo;so, I&rsquo;ll take a step first. You can catch up with it quickly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After saying that, without waiting for others to speak, with a wave of his hand, the gray light flashed, humanized into a bright light, and galloped toward the Seven Mile cave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hum!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A cold hum rang out from the crowd, and they were stunned, but Lu Shun was there with an expression of indifference.</p>
<p>Li Xun is a little embarrassed. After all, both of them were teachers of their own generation, and it was hard to say anything at the moment. So they turned to FA Xiang and Lu Xueqi and said, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go quickly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>FA Xiang and Lu Xueqi nodded and rose in the air at the same time. Li Xun followed. Lu Shun was reluctant, but shangguance was obviously much higher in the hearts of the people than he was. In addition, Li Xun also said something. All the disciples followed him one after another. Finally, he had to scold two words in a low voice and flew up.</p>
<p>At the front, FA Xiang and Lu Xueqi go up side by side. Behind them, Li Xun takes off a little slower than them. At the moment, he also gradually catches up.</p>
<p>Just when Li Xun could catch up with her, Lu Xueqi suddenly said to herself, &ldquo;Uncle Shangguan, how fast you are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>FA Xiang was beside her, surrounded by the golden light of the magic wheel&rsquo;s return beads. Her robe of moon white monk was blown by the wind, and now she turned her head to Lu Xueqi. I saw the woman dressed in white like snow and her face as cold as frost. She was as cool and gorgeous as a nine day fairy flying in the night sky.</p>
<p>His eyes brightened, and a meaningful smile appeared at the corner of his mouth and said in a low voice, &ldquo;yes! He walked so fast&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hiss!&rdquo; At the sound of the wind, Li Xun catches up and flies with them. After a while, Lu Shun also catches up. At this moment, I think it&rsquo;s Shangguan&rsquo;s policy. It&rsquo;s really unpredictable. In front of them, he could not be seen.</p>
<p>In qilidong, the war became more and more fierce, although the great wizard on the mountain platform was struggling. However, under its mysterious magic power, the black staff inlaid with bone jade emits more and more intense red awn, covering the whole qilidong Valley, and still struggling to support under the terrible huge fireball attack in the sky.</p>
<p>Several times, the red curtain trembled violently, and it was about to collapse when it was hit by a huge fireball. However, the big wizard danced and made strange movements, and he even held up again. But no one was standing nearby. Otherwise, we could see the big wizard&rsquo;s wrinkled face and bleeding all over his seven orifices. He was afraid that he was at the end of his strength.</p>
<p>However, in the valley, the fighting between the Miao and Li soldiers is more unfavorable to the Miao people.</p>
<p>The Miao soldiers, who had once respected the great wizard as the God of heaven, were astonished to see that the great wizard was suppressed by the devil like devil in the sky. In addition, the once-in-a-thousand-year dog God barked at the sky, and the thought of despair reverberated in everyone&rsquo;s mind. On the contrary, the morale of Li soldiers is high, even their eyes are red.</p>
<p>GUI Li stood in the distance, his brows wrinkled. The magic of that mysterious figure in the sky was extremely rare and strange. In particular, there was a strange black fire in the fire. He had never heard of it before. It was in the collection of guiwangzong that there was no record of it.</p>
<p>In the southern frontier, there are such figures. As expected, the world is so big that there are hidden dragons and crouching tigers.</p>
<p>The wizard was about to fly up to help him. Suddenly, he heard the voice of screams in the distance suddenly sounded, mostly the voice of women, girls and children.</p>
<p>Looking around, I saw that Miao women, girls and children were hiding near the mountain top. I don&rsquo;t know when they were found by a group of Li soldiers. At that time, they were like sheep and wolves, and it was bloody.</p>
<p>His body trembled. In the past ten years, he experienced countless bloody scenes, but he did not kill these innocent people who had no strength to fight back. Somehow, at this moment, the crying voices of these women, children and children suddenly pierced his heart like a sword</p>
<p>When I was a teenager, I saw a sea of corpses, a scene of tragedy in Caomiao village, and those relatives and neighbors who grew up from childhood, did they also die like this</p>
<p>Standing on the side of Xiaobai, suddenly turned his head, a strong bloody evil spirit, from the side of the man, slowly sent out.</p>
<p>His eyes, all of a sudden, were red.</p>
<p>In the Miao crowd, a woman screamed and was cut down by Li soldiers. A child behind her was full of fear and ran with his mouth wide open, but he couldn&rsquo;t make a sound because he was the dumb man who delivered food for the ghost.</p>
<p>The murderer, who was splashed with blood, chased after him with a grim smile. After a few steps, he reached the back of the child, holding a sharp stone axe and cutting it down heavily.</p>
<p>The child was unable to fall down and opened his mouth in despair at the last moment of his life.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>The blood splashed in all directions, blooming in the night. Such a strong body broke down and split in an instant, and it fell like rain one after another, bathing in the bloody wind, red eyes and deep breathing.</p>
<p>Look up, howl!</p>
<p>The voice was so shrill, like the desperate cry of a fierce ghost, the struggle of decaying darkness in ten years went straight up to the sky.</p>
<p>People are shocked!</p>
<p>The child shivered all over, looking at the black magic wand in Gui Li&rsquo;s hands, which was instantly bright. Flashing blood and greedy light. In a moment, a dozen Li soldiers who were hunting for women and children in the vicinity were torn apart by the power of invisible demons, and countless blood roared into the sky. In the middle of the air gathered like a flood, surrounded by the desperate and crazy figure, swift and violent flow, and then gradually was sucked in by the bloody beads in the ghost&rsquo;s hands.</p>
<p>The whole battlefield, stunned, stopped. Looking at the devil like figure, the eyes are full of fear.</p>
<p>The blood sucking beads are more and more bright, and the familiar cold feeling is not only circulating in the body. At the moment, the blood sucking beads that have absorbed more than ten people&rsquo;s blood essence are like a new life. The magic power is great, and the strange red light is more and more bright, reflecting the ghost&rsquo;s eyes, straight like ghost fire.</p>
<p>Xiaobai stood in the distance, staring at the figure that gradually became bloody and crazy, and suddenly turned his head.</p>
<p>Do not want to see, night wind and blood rain, as if there is her gently sigh.</p>
<p>For a long time, the long lost * *, the cry of buried heart, and the rebelliousness that once flashed away from ancient times, suddenly rose again.</p>
<p>He cried out!</p>
<p>Heaven and earth should be in harmony.</p>
<p>Fire in the sky, red curtain on the earth, shaking at the same time.</p>
<p>In the blood light, it seems to be a grim smile from the nether world.</p>
<p>One step, step out!</p>
<p>The smell of blood was all around in an instant. Countless people scattered and fled, do not understand how this originally saved people, how suddenly become a devil.</p>
<p>Just, just. The sweetness of the blood was in front of him. He was so intoxicated that he could not restrain it. He breathed deeply and gasped heavily. In the madness, there was still a trace of pain</p>
<p>Lonely because of madness?</p>
<p>Or crazy because of loneliness?</p>
<p>Blood sucking beads are on his hand, and he is dependent on each other. Never give up, but the flashing red light, but as if laughing at the world.</p>
<p>Sink, sink!</p>
<p>All things are like ants,</p>
<p>Life is lonely!</p>
<p>When he reached for it, there was a drop of blood on the edge of his finger. The dumb boy under his palm was trembling and unable to move. He only looked at a red curtain, blocking the sky and the sun. That was the moment when he was about to die</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zhang! Small! Where&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>In the sky, the voice suddenly came, such as cutting ice and snow, like a phoenix singing nine days, with endless anger and endless sadness!</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi, dressed in white like snow, broke through the sky in the blood light. The sky Ya in her hand came out of the scabbard. The blue light was shining, reflecting her face, her eyes, her anger and sadness.</p>
<p>The red light suddenly rises, head-on, thundering and thundering. In an instant, all the land in ten Zhang&rsquo;s radius is broken. Not far away, the river, which has been dyed red with blood, is washed back into the sky, burning the whole sky.</p>
<p>In the bloodstain, the great wizard in the distance was gradually unable to resist, and the red curtain gradually weakened. At the beginning, a huge fireball passed through the red curtain and crashed into the ground of qilidong. In the roar and scream, the flames were blazing like hell on earth.</p>
<p>In the sea of fire, red and blue fight and then separated, the woman in white slowly fell down, a face even more without the slightest blood color.</p>
<p>In front of her, the low breathing person, surrounded by fierce light and blood flame, holds the blood eating magic stick</p>
<p>The hot wind, blowing her skirt hair. In the light of the fire, her body clearly trembled slightly.</p>
<p>Only holding Tianya&rsquo;s hand, because of this force and motionless.</p>
<p>With the sharp noise, FA Xiang, Li Xun and others fell behind Lu Xueqi. They were only among the crowd, but did not see the figure of shangguance.</p>
<p>All the people saw the demon like ferocity in front of him. His whole body was covered with blood, and his face was even more fierce. All those who had known him in the past were appalled. Li Xun was better, but in the eyes of FA Xiang, he felt the pain that could not be erased. His body also seemed to shake and chant the Buddha in a low voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You, you&hellip;&rdquo; The expression on Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s face could not keep her apathy any longer. There was only sadness and anger. At this moment, she could not even speak for a moment.</p>
<p>Li Xun stands by and looks at Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s face. He is such a smart person. Naturally, he doesn&rsquo;t think that Lu Xueqi is so disrespectful, just because of resentment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zhang Xiaofan!&rdquo; Li Xun drank, looked solemn and angry, and said angrily, &ldquo;the people of Southern Xinjiang in the valley have never had anything to do with the Middle Earth. What hatred do you have with them and want to kill people like this for pleasure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li and Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s body almost shook at the same time.</p>
<p>Under the red light of blood sucking pearls, the fierce fighting between the Miao and Li nationalities has been going on for a long time. The two clans have been fighting each other for a long time. This is even more a decisive battle. The ground is full of corpses. Most of them are terrible. What&rsquo;s more, a large number of Miao women, children and children who have just been chased out of their hiding places by Li soldiers. It&rsquo;s a mess of death and injury.</p>
<p>Li and Miao people have a bitter feud with each other. Even if they are against women and children, they will never show mercy. The scene is tragic and the surrounding area is blazing with blazing flames. It&rsquo;s a human hell.</p>
<p>At this moment, no matter in whose eyes, is the murderer who caused all this!</p>
<p>He was like a bloody devil standing on the slaughterhouse.</p>
<p>Greedy and evil. Violent and crazy!</p>
<p>Perhaps, there is a trace of despair buried deep.</p>
<p>The late mellow and Yang Qi seemed to be unable to move under the pressure of blood sucking demons. Until now, they were released bit by bit, offsetting the cold breath in his heart.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that he suddenly laughs. Maybe he&rsquo;d rather not wake up.</p>
<p>Through the flaming flame, the sad eyes of the woman in white pierced through all the obstacles in the world, and penetrated into whose heart?</p>
<p>She slowly raised the sword in her hand, and the light of Tianya was like autumn water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zhang, Xiao. Where&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>The faint voice, in the flaming flame, came low and low. She bit her lip and she shed tears.</p>
<p>Tears mixed with blood, gently dripping on the edge of Tianya sword, quietly, sliding, landing, has become blood.</p>
<p>Who is it, whose heart has been hurt</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah</p>
<p>He looked up to the sky and roared. In the sea of blood and fire, although his heart is clear, people are crazy.</p>
<p>Break it! Break it!</p>
<p>Break the past!</p>
<p>He grinned grimly in the fire, covering his pain with madness. Phagocytic blood bead soars boundless blood light, accompany the host, toward justice that side - rush!</p>
<p>Some people, in the distance, gently sigh, but no one. You can hear it.</p>
<p>The figure of despair, as if vaguely before, people in the right way were angry and alert, reflected in Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s bright eyes, that figure.</p>
<p>Her lips, slightly trembling, whispered to herself, that crazy rush to the people ah</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zhang Xiaofan&hellip;&rdquo; She called in a voice nobody could hear, quietly, for the third time.</p>
<p>Then, she rushed with the sword, white as snow, as gaunt as fire, but still so beautiful lily.</p>
<p>Zheng!</p>
<p>In the sharp sound, the Tianya sword glows all over the sky and blocks out the sun. However, the red light that eats the blood beads is like a ghost. It looms in the blue light. No matter how strong the blue light is, it can not be completely suppressed.</p>
<p>Roaring, the sky huge flame falls, the two figures separate and meet again, in this hell like place, two people, finally once again decisive battle.</p>
<p>Even though the two figures are so desolate in the fire.</p>
<p>Ahetai couldn&rsquo;t get back to God. Things were going very smoothly. Unexpectedly, things happened suddenly. Strange things happened one by one on the ground of qilidong, and strange people appeared one after another. All of them were practitioners of Taoism, and even some experts were afraid of him.</p>
<p>But the following characters, but also inexplicably very, a few words less than, it is their own fight, pour him to the side. However, the Li people, who had the upper hand, were flushed by these people, and they were shocked to the same extent as the Miao people, and all of them retreated to one side.</p>
<p>Ahetai can&rsquo;t take so many curses in his heart at the moment. Moreover, before he came out of the mountain, the cold words of the demon king echoed in his ears: &ldquo;as long as you take back the sacred jade of the Li nationality, and then take away the black staff of the Miao&rsquo;s sacred utensil, the Li people&rsquo;s potential to replace the Miao people will be irreversible&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He inhaled deeply and concentrated his mind again on the wizard who was still fighting in the corner. He roared. In the clouds, he opened his arms and burst out blood from his 14 joints. Almost at the same time, the black fire in countless huge fireballs was booming at the same time, and they all got out of the clouds and fell down on the wizard.</p>
<p>Finally, the fragile red curtain couldn&rsquo;t hold on. Under the constant impact of the burning fireball, a moment later, it suddenly disappeared.</p>
<p>In an instant, the whole qilidong fell into a sea of fire, and the great wizard fell to the ground with a hissing cry.</p>
<p>Ahetai was so happy that he rushed down from mid air and rushed to the platform where the great wizard was.</p>
<p>The great wizard struggled to stand up with the black stick and hissed: &ldquo;you, you are crazy, and you go to ask for the monster&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without waiting for him to finish, ahotai kicked down the old man who was already very weak. At the same time, he grabbed the black staff and looked at the top of the black staff carefully. It turned out that it was the bone jade sacred vessel that the Li people had been worrying about for 200 years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha ha ha ha&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was very proud. Not to mention, he was about to make up for the attack and kill the enemy of Li nationality for hundreds of years. However, with a flash of his eyes, he could see that some people from other ethnic groups at the foot of the mountain had noticed this place, and they all got up and flew.</p>
<p>Ahetai was shocked and decided not to do too much for a moment. Anyway, after the war, the great wizard, under the power of the demon king, was a useless man, and did no harm to the Li people.</p>
<p>In a flash, he put his black stick around his chest and recited a mysterious mantra in his mouth. A moment later, the fire fell all over the sky and surrounded him. Then he rose to the sky and disappeared in the blazing fire.</p>
<p>The only thing left was a seven mile cave like hell, and an old man, on the platform, panted in a despairing low voice, shouting: &ldquo;beast demon! That&rsquo;s a monster! How dare you&hellip; &quot; (to be continued. )</p>
