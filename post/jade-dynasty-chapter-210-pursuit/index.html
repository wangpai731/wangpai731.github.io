      <p>At the moment, Jin pinger&rsquo;s face looked very tired, as if she had just experienced a great war and was exhausted. However, in the face of these righteous disciples, Jin pinger still showed a moving smile. In the dark, she looked extremely miserable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naturally, it&rsquo;s me, the young master of the burning incense valley. Why, we only met a few times, so you never forget me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li Xun&rsquo;s face turned red and stepped back. He said angrily, &ldquo;who cares about you? You&rsquo;re a witch who killed my younger martial sister Yanhong at the beginning, but now I&rsquo;m going to ask you for blood debt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, Li Xun waved his hand. His body was like electricity, and he was already plundering towards the Golden Vase. Zeng Shushu frowned at his back and stopped talking. After a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, the disciples of the burning incense Valley who were beside him also rushed up to him in the sound of shouting and drinking. For a moment, he was very powerful.</p>
<p>Jin Ping&rsquo;er snorted, and a sneer flashed in her eyes. However, many of her enemies came together. She was tired at the moment. Naturally, she would not try to fight with her own strength. I saw her soft face, suddenly flashed a strong, as if determined, at the same time a light drink, the edge of the right hand purple light, murderous gas.</p>
<p>Li Xun and Jin pinger fight each other several times. Knowing the power of the demon demon girl, Li Xun is on guard. At the same time, he finds that the wind is blowing behind him, and many younger martial brothers are rushing to attack him. Li Xun&rsquo;s surprise is not trivial. He quickly stops shouting, and everyone is stunned and stops. But at this moment of slight chaos, suddenly the purple light at the gold vase in front of him surged like a purple flame. Li Xun gave a big drink and stood in front of the crowd. He sacrificed his sword in his hand and blocked the purple light.</p>
<p>However, after Li Xun blocked this seemingly powerful magic, he suddenly frowned and was stunned for a moment. The originally predicted power was just like a piece of thin paper, and the seemingly powerful magic skill instantly dissipated, and behind the purple light. The figure of the Golden Vase has disappeared in the dark again.</p>
<p>Li Xun&rsquo;s face was black and blue, and he said in a voice of hatred: &ldquo;the cunning witch has caught her way again. Let&rsquo;s go after her quickly!&rdquo; Say it. When he chased after him, people in the burning incense Valley naturally followed his lead and caught up with them one after another. Zeng Shushu half open mouth, want to say something, but look at the figures flickering. Then he couldn&rsquo;t shake his head, sighed, looked around carefully, and slowly followed up.</p>
<p>Li Xun seems to be extremely resentful of jinpinger. He follows him all the way and refuses to relax for a moment.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, with the Golden Vase&rsquo;s Taoist ability, if Li Xun is the first one at any time and place on weekdays, he would want to slip away like this. It&rsquo;s not too hard for her. However, at the moment, she was extremely unlucky. On the one hand, she was unavoidable in this ancient cave, which seemed to have only one road. Secondly, not long ago, she had a fight with the mysterious woman who suddenly appeared, namely Jiuwei Tianhu Xiaobai. Although she was not hurt, and took advantage of Xiaobai&rsquo;s entanglement with devils, she was consumed by Xiaobai&rsquo;s strange magic Measure your mana.</p>
<p>We should know that Xiaobai is the ancestor of the fox demon family. He has been practicing Taoism all over the world for thousands of years. Looking at the world, he is also a first-class person. Although jinpinger is also a very intelligent woman, she still suffers from the dark loss under Xiaobai. Originally, this is nothing, and it is not a disgrace. Second, Jin pinger was not hurt, and Xiaobai didn&rsquo;t mean to hurt her. However, when she was so weak, she met Li Xun and others.</p>
<p>Li Xun chased after him all the way, but he couldn&rsquo;t breathe for a moment. The burning incense Valley ranked among the three main sects in the right way. Li Xun is also the most proud disciple of Yun Yilan, the master of the burning incense valley. His practice is not to be underestimated. Jin pinger&rsquo;s several times of skillful or full speed gallop can&rsquo;t escape Li Xun&rsquo;s eyes and ears. After a long time, Jin pinger felt that she began to feel chest tightness slowly, and even her breathing was not even.</p>
<p>Jinpinger is more and more anxious. Since entering the ancient cave, strange things have happened one after another. First, he met the mysterious woman Xiaobai, and then the ghost and the mysterious woman disappeared at the same time. Not long ago, the strange roar and the extremely hot heat wave from the deep of the cave seemed to indicate that someone had already started fighting in the cave. However, after a few thoughts, Jin pinger did not want to go into it rashly. After all, for her, she was not willing to take great risks to go in as GUI Li did. Although the relationship between GUI Wang Zong and her was not shallow at the moment, it was not to the extent that she worked hard for it.</p>
<p>But at the moment, there are people chasing after it hard. The Golden Vase is flashing all the way, and I don&rsquo;t know how far it has gone to the depths of the ancient magic cave. This ancient cave is really deep and terrible. It can&rsquo;t be seen from its appearance. It seems that the terrain of this cave does not have a serious downward slope, but I don&rsquo;t know where it leads.</p>
<p>In the dark, the wind in my ear was as sharp as the sound of a knife. I don&rsquo;t know when it started. The gust of Yin wind has disappeared, but Li Xun&rsquo;s voice has always followed behind and never disappeared.</p>
<p>At this time, in the darkness ahead, suddenly there was a vague figure, and what eye power Jin Ping&rsquo;er had. In a moment, he could see that it was the woman who had suffered a lot just now, namely Jiuwei Tianhu Xiaobai.</p>
<p>But stands silently in the dark Xiaobai, seems to have discovered something, on the body lit up a white soft light, slowly turned around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s you again!&rdquo; Xiaobai frowned and said to the Golden Vase.</p>
<p>Jin pinger&rsquo;s way was blocked by her, so she had to stop. Just now she had learned Xiaobai&rsquo;s methods and deeds, and she didn&rsquo;t dare to act rashly. But at the moment, there was a interception, and then there was a pursuit of soldiers.</p>
<p>Xiaobai&rsquo;s face seemed to be worried. She looked at the Golden Vase and didn&rsquo;t mean to get out of the way. She didn&rsquo;t want to let her go. She was about to speak. Suddenly, she was stunned, turned to look at the road, and then suddenly sneered and said, &ldquo;strange, there are so many people here today!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the sound of his speech, Li Xun&rsquo;s figure swept out of the darkness with the roar. After seeing that there was a beautiful strange woman in the scene, Li Xun was obviously on guard. Instead of taking a hand at the Golden Vase standing in front of him, Li Xun stood still.</p>
<p>Xiaobai takes a look at Li Xun. Suddenly, his eyes are cold. It seems that he recognizes Li Xun. A moment later, only hearing the roar of the wind, Li Xun kept flashing figures in the dark behind him. However, other disciples of the burning incense Valley arrived. These people were not as good as Li Xun and much slower than him.</p>
<p>Xiaobai turned his eyes around the faces and clothes of the disciples of the incense burning Valley, and suddenly sneered: &ldquo;people of the burning incense Valley?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next to the Golden Vase son can&rsquo;t help but look at Xiaobai, vaguely aware that Xiaobai is dissatisfied with the people in the incense burning Valley, and can&rsquo;t help but feel secretly happy.</p>
<p>At the same time, Li Xun couldn&rsquo;t figure out the real or the real situation of Xiaobai, and he didn&rsquo;t want to make extra efforts at the moment. At the moment, he said in a loud voice: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Li Xun. This is the disciple of the master of the burning incense Valley, Yunyi and Lan Valley. Who is the girl? We don&rsquo;t mean to offend the girl, it&rsquo;s just this woman, &ldquo;he pointed to the Golden Vase. She said, &ldquo;she is a demon cult girl who is full of evils. We are going to get rid of her. If the girl has nothing else to do, please stand aside. We are very grateful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaobai snorted. Instead of walking away, he slowly took two steps forward and said, &ldquo;I just have some things, so I can&rsquo;t go away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li Xun&rsquo;s face changed, and several of the disciples of the burning incense valley after him had already drunk.</p>
<p>Li Xun said in a deep voice: &ldquo;this girl, if you defend this demon girl, you are against the burning incense Valley, and also against the world&rsquo;s right way. Do you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaobai&rsquo;s &ldquo;ha&rdquo; laughs and reaches out his hand like a white jade. He gently stroked his hair on the temples and said with a sneer: &ldquo;are you against the burning incense Valley? Against the right way in the world? You know, these are the rest of your aunt&rsquo;s play thousands of years ago. &quot;</p>
<p>Li Xun&rsquo;s face flashed with anger when all the disciples of the burning incense valley were in a big uproar. However, his determination was better than these younger martial brothers. He was not clear about the origin and identity of the mysterious woman for a moment. Instead, he stopped several younger martial brothers on the main stream and said in a cold voice, &ldquo;this girl has a big voice. Who is your name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaobai there didn&rsquo;t answer him, but he was stunned. After a long time, she seemed to say two words to herself, but suddenly it was a &ldquo;Puff Chi&rdquo; sound, it was her own inexplicable smile out. He shook his head and said in a low voice: &ldquo;Auntie Alas, I haven&rsquo;t talked like this for a long time. I can&rsquo;t even hear it back. It&rsquo;s really Well, is it really old? &quot;</p>
<p>Said. The smile on her face slowly disappeared, and her expression seemed to be a little distracted.</p>
<p>The Gold Vase son is beside for it is dumb, temporarily do not know what this strange woman is thinking.</p>
<p>However good-natured Li Xun was, Xiaobai almost burst into a rage and said angrily, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m good to advise you. If you don&rsquo;t get out of the way, don&rsquo;t blame us for offending us.&rdquo; After that, he sneered and said, &ldquo;I can catch you just by your words challenging the world&rsquo;s justice. Don&rsquo;t be ungrateful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaobai slowly raised his eyes, looked at Li Xun deeply, and suddenly said, &ldquo;that little girl!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jin Ping&rsquo;er didn&rsquo;t respond at first, until Xiaobai called for the second time. He was stunned and said, &ldquo;are you calling me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaobai snorted and said, &ldquo;who are you and me calling?&rdquo; With that, she gently waved her hand and took a step. However, she was in the middle of Li Xun and Jin pinger, saying, &ldquo;you go! I&rsquo;ll stand in your way. &quot;</p>
<p>Li Xun and others suddenly changed color, but Jin pinger was overjoyed. They couldn&rsquo;t believe it for a moment. They even said, &ldquo;thank you very much Thank you very much. &quot;</p>
<p>She said, for fear that the strange woman would repent, she quickly flashed to the darkness ahead.</p>
<p>How can Li Xun and others make the murderer escape again? Just as they are trying to chase after him, they can only see a flash of white light. In an instant, a light curtain has already lit up and blocked Xiaobai&rsquo;s body. After a while, the figure of Jin pinger has disappeared.</p>
<p>Li Xun was so angry that he turned to Xiaobai and said, &ldquo;who are you, why do you want to help that witch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaobai smiles. It seems that Li Xun&rsquo;s anger makes her more happy. She says leisurely: &ldquo;I? Who am I? Do you care! As for why I want to help her, it&rsquo;s because I don&rsquo;t like you who burn incense valley. &quot;</p>
<p>Li Xun and all the disciples of the burning incense valley behind him were stunned for a moment. They were speechless. Li Xun couldn&rsquo;t help asking, &ldquo;this girl, have we ever met before, or have we ever offended you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaobai shook his head and rolled his eyes slightly. His eyes were flowing like water. There was a faint soul like smile between his lips. He said, &ldquo;we haven&rsquo;t met. You haven&rsquo;t offended me, but I am&hellip;&rdquo; She smiles and seems very happy to say, &ldquo;but I just don&rsquo;t like Fen Xiang valley. What can you do with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li Xun and others were so angry that their teeth itched. Without waiting for Li Xun&rsquo;s order, some disciples of the burning incense Valley rushed forward in anger. Li Xun did not stop her. The woman was so insulting and provocative. If she didn&rsquo;t teach her a lesson, she would be shameless in the future.</p>
<p>In the dark, only a dozen figures were seen, leaping out of the darkness. Toward that piece of white light curtain, one after another, but behind the light curtain, Xiaobai&rsquo;s smile is still. It&rsquo;s just that in my eyes, there&rsquo;s more sarcasm.</p>
<p>The wind, accompanied by the rapid passing figure, turns into a sharp whistling sound in my ears, and I don&rsquo;t know how many roads there are. It&rsquo;s gone under your feet. Lu Xueqi flies in this ancient dark cave, facing the unknown mystery ahead.</p>
<p>Somehow, she clearly still did not know what was waiting for her in front of her, but in her heart, there was a kind of fanatical mood, which was burning like the most ardent flame in her frost like heart.</p>
<p>So she galloped, regardless of anything else.</p>
<p>The figures behind him had already disappeared, when they passed a place just now.</p>
<p>She almost subconsciously felt that there was a figure hidden in the darkness, but the feeling was fleeting. Among the lights, the figure in the dark seemed to have some changes, and then it seemed that something had been discovered and disappeared.</p>
<p>Far behind, that bursts of whistling wind, I do not know if there is such a sigh?</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi doesn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>She had never taken it to heart.</p>
<p>How many things will happen in such a life. Or people, is it worth your recklessness?</p>
<p>If not, maybe it&rsquo;s sad!</p>
<p>If there is, then do nothing!</p>
<p>Tianya sword is in your hand. Bloom more and more intense light, like the most surging tide of mind, suddenly flash.</p>
<p>That piece, the blue figure, more and more fly far, but as if. Closer and closer!</p>
<p>The wind is still blowing,</p>
<p>The road ahead is still dark,</p>
<p>But, after all, there will be someone at the end of this road!</p>
<p>She flies, flies, flies</p>
<p>That beam, green light, slowly lit up in front, Lu Xueqi finally saw the first beam of light in the dark, far away, in the dark, like a lonely ghost gently wandering.</p>
<p>She suddenly stopped. In an instant, all the brilliance on the Tianya sword converged, like a woman who was afraid of hiding quietly. Dark dark slowly rose, engulfed her figure, covered the past.</p>
<p>In the dark, she stares at the green light silently. Behind the green light, what is waiting for her?</p>
<p>Is it disappointment or him?</p>
<p>If he is, what?</p>
<p>She hesitated and hesitated for it. The fervor in her heart, like a flame, was still burning and never disappeared, but there was still some faint pain in the depth of the flame.</p>
<p>She gazed for a long time, a long time, slowly, moving back a step.</p>
<p>Is it fear or retreat?</p>
<p>Is there anyone else you can&rsquo;t face in this life?</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t, or dare not?</p>
<p>Slowly, there is a sense of suffocation, the darkness around grinning, who is in front? Fate never smiles, who can defeat themselves so easily. Never afraid of life and death, never afraid of time, but who can, completely face deep heart?</p>
<p>In the dark, there was silence.</p>
<p>She seemed to be retreating again.</p>
<p>Invisible face, what kind of pain?</p>
<p>Suddenly, the blazing heat wave suddenly appeared, behind the green light, came a huge roar.</p>
<p>The red flame, like a ferocious murderer, frightens all things in the world with its ferocious smile and roaring voice. The ground and the surrounding rock walls began to vibrate again. Probably because of the proximity, the shaking earth was shaking even more. It was impossible to imagine what kind of scene it would be in the depths of the fire.</p>
<p>The fire reflected far away, and her eyes were shining in the dark.</p>
<p>Burning, like eyes!</p>
<p>The light blue light suddenly flashed again and burst out from the darkness. In the heat wave rolling, the beautiful figure stood against the wind and her hair was flying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boom!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The huge roar and the tremor of the earth are like thunder god, which frightens ordinary people. The whole cave seems to be shaking. Countless falling stones are falling like drizzle. But the figure has disappeared in place.</p>
<p>She galloped, in that doomsday general scene, in more and more like crazy falling stones, galloping toward the flame, the brightest place, galloping away!</p>
<p>No one knows what&rsquo;s going to be ahead.</p>
<p>But who cares? (to be continued. )</p>
