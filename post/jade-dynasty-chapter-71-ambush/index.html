      <p>These five people are all born under the Qingyun gate. At this moment, they are flying fast with magic weapons. However, in a moment, under the light of all magic weapons, they have seen the end of the forest edge in front of them, and even farther, the sea in the dark night.</p>
<p>The sea breeze comes, along with the whistling, reverberates in this late night.</p>
<p>The hearts of all the people are full of joy and spirit. They are about to speed up their flight out of the dark forest. All of a sudden, just at this time, a dark red light was emitted silently from the dark place, and he Dazhi, who was flying in the middle, was hit quickly and incomparably.</p>
<p>He Dazhi snorted and swayed, but he fell from the air. Song Daren and others were shocked, but in a flash, they had gone far ahead. They turned around and flew back. Zhang Xiaofan and Tian linger, who were behind, also hurried to he Dazhi.</p>
<p>Du Bishu and he Dazhi are the closest and fastest reaction among all people. They immediately stop their bodies and fall beside him. They look around and ask, &ldquo;are you OK, senior brother? &quot;</p>
<p>He Dazhi&rsquo;s forehead was already covered with cold sweat in a moment, and he said in a hoarse voice, &ldquo;be careful, this man demon method is so fierce.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before he had finished a word, he saw another dark red light in the dark. Du Bishu frowns tightly. He blocks his body horizontally in front of him Dazhi. He holds the formula with his hands. The three strange dice immediately fly out to welcome the red light.</p>
<p>In the dark, someone said &ldquo;eh&rdquo;, which was quite strange, but it seemed that it was an accident to the shape of the magic weapon. For Du Bishu&rsquo;s Taoism, the red light rushed over without any hesitation.</p>
<p>In an instant, when the two things collided, Du Bishu was shocked. He only felt that when the red light hit his own dice magic weapon, a strong evil spirit spread to his magic weapon. At the same time, he took the magic weapon as the coal, which had a tendency to attack him.</p>
<p>Du Bishu was surprised. He had never seen such evil and evil ways before. He did not know what to do when song Daren and Tian linger arrived. Zhang Xiaofan follows. With a frown on his brow, he only felt that the red light was familiar to him. It seemed that it was the &ldquo;Red Devil&rsquo;s eye&rdquo; of the old leader of the blood refining Hall of the demon sect who was in the abyss of the dead spirit that day.</p>
<p>Sure enough, with a few long smiles. Several people came out of the dark place. It was the blood refining hall headed by the eldest brother.</p>
<p>The eldest brother of the year stood at the front, with a big red eye on his face. It was terrible, but now it has slowly returned to normal. Behind him, the beautiful woman, Liu Hao and the wild dog Taoist were also there, except for the young Lin Feng.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan met these people many times and recognized them at a glance, especially the wild dog Taoist, who brought the old blood sucking demon here tonight. Zhang Xiaofan suffered a lot. But when I looked at him at the moment, I saw that the wild dog&rsquo;s face was blue and purple, and there were many scars. I think it was the old blood sucking demon who just threw him away, but let him bump into a seven meat and eight vegetable in the lush and thick forest. His face was full of bags.</p>
<p>These people in the blood refining hall are weak now. When the big sects and the righteous fight in the demon sect, they are assigned to the far edge of the forest. They just wait to see if there are any missing fish. It is obvious that the people of the demon sect despise them.</p>
<p>The eldest brother and others dare not be angry. Originally, I was angry with myself, but it was a great opportunity for me to make contributions. I just wanted to capture these people. In the future, the position of blood refining hall will be improved a little.</p>
<p>The wild dog Taoist was very depressed tonight. Looking around, he suddenly found that the familiar Qingyun gate boy was among the five people, and he was looking at himself at the moment with a smile on his face. I think I&rsquo;m laughing at myself.</p>
<p>The wild dog is very angry. The blood sucking old demon has a high way of life and a fierce disposition. He dare not go to find revenge for the wild dog with ten courage. But when he saw Zhang Xiaofan at the moment, he immediately thought that if it wasn&rsquo;t for this bad boy, he would not suffer such pain. At the moment, he was angry and cried twice. He sacrificed the fangs magic weapon and beat Zhang Xiaofan.</p>
<p>There is a plot to succeed. The old and upright are domineering. You should say something like, &ldquo;be wise, and you will suffer less from flesh and skin. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to say anything, but the wild dog has already rushed over. This words came to the mouth, opened a half mouth to be about to open, forcefully swallowed back, in a hurry, can&rsquo;t help but also fork gas, cough twice, the heart is very angry!</p>
<p>Song Daren rushes to he Dazhi, falls down and checks his figure. However, he finds that the younger martial brother just caught by surprise and has been invaded by evil evil spirit. It seems that he can&rsquo;t do it for a while, but fortunately, he has no worries about his life.</p>
<p>He was worried about himself. Suddenly, he heard two strange barks behind him. He saw a demon with a dog face rushing to him. Zhang Xiaofan, the younger martial brother, offered a magic weapon to catch him and made a noise.</p>
<p>In the distance, the old man glared at the wild dog, but then frowned. He recognized that the Green Cloud Gate kid who had the strange fire stick magic weapon in his hand was the one who fought with the wild dog. On that day, his red devil eye could not help him, and almost suffered losses in his hands, so he was very impressed.</p>
<p>At this time, the wild dog Taoist and Zhang Xiaofan have been fighting for a while, and their figures flash in the forest, turning into two lights. But the wild dog Taoist was more and more frightened. He disappeared for several months. Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s Taoism was much more advanced than that of that day in the dead spirit abyss. In particular, the ancient strange fire stick in his hand was ugly but shining with blue light. It flashed in front of him.</p>
<p>Every time his magic weapon fangs rush up, but when it comes to the firecracker, it immediately retreats. With the passage of time, the place in front of the firecracker, which is like the blue and black beads, gradually emits a faint sucking force and sucks at himself.</p>
<p>The wild dog Taoist was so cold that he couldn&rsquo;t help thinking of the unlucky old man Jiang Laosan who was killed by the boy&rsquo;s absorption of blood essence for some reason. He secretly said that the right little bastard now has ten times more evil magic weapons than your wild dog grandpa!</p>
<p>The old man&rsquo;s eyebrows are wrinkled. I think there are many people coming to the church tonight. I&rsquo;m afraid that someone will come soon. In case someone sees that the blood refining hall can&rsquo;t even clean up a few young Qingyun people now, I&rsquo;m afraid that I won&rsquo;t be able to see them again. Then he turned to the beautiful woman and Liu Hao.</p>
<p>The two men knew each other and ran to the field immediately. But at the same time, song Daren and Tian linger also met.</p>
<p>In fact, this evening&rsquo;s situation is not good for the people in the right way. Originally, people gathered in loub, a remote place, but it was only the remnant of a small evil cult. Unexpectedly, not only did many people come here, but also some old demons who had lived in seclusion for a hundred years were born.</p>
<p>Song Daren was worried. Seeing that he was entangled by the people of the demon sect again, he was trying his best to solve these evils. Unexpectedly, just after he started, a dark red light came to him. Song Daren took it with a magic sword, and his heart sank suddenly.</p>
<p>The evil spirit from the red devil&rsquo;s eyes suddenly attacked through the &ldquo;ten tigers&rdquo; immortal sword. Song Daren had a profound way of life and naturally resisted it.</p>
<p>But at the same time, he felt that the evil man&rsquo;s way of doing was not low, just afraid that he was better than himself.</p>
<p>At this time, Tian ling&rsquo;er has been fighting with the beautiful woman. Du Bishu looks around for a while, and then he can see that the big eyed monster has powerful magic. The elder martial brother has some difficulty, so he rushes up to fight with song Daren for two enemies and one enemy. The eldest brother of the year stood in the same place, and the red devil&rsquo;s eyes kept shooting out the red light full of evil spirit. With one enemy and two enemies, he did not fall for a while.</p>
<p>And in the distance. Liu Hao rushed to the wild dog, and the wild dog together against Zhang Xiaofan.</p>
<p>After all, Zhang Xiaofan is not the eldest brother who has been practicing for many years. After a while, he immediately feels pressure. The wild dog gets strong help and gets a boost of spirit. He laughs and says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wait for you to fall into my hands today and see how grandpa wild dog cleans you up! &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan felt more and more pressure in front of him. However, he had to bite his teeth, hoping that the two elder martial brothers and elder martial sisters could solve other demons as soon as possible. Since he had understood part of the meaning of &ldquo;Tianshu&rdquo; in the black stone cave, Taoism actually went further unconsciously. However, he could not use the Buddhist Prajna in this public. Last but not least, tonight he was defeated by the old blood sucking demon. Although the injury was not serious, he was fighting fiercely for a long time. Gradually the body began to disobey.</p>
<p>In the nearby fighting method, Tian ling&rsquo;er and the beautiful woman are not separated. They fly high and flash low. They are both pretty and graceful, but they will be hard to come by for a while. Song Daren and Du Bishu are also tied up by the eldest brother at the moment. Although they see that the situation of the younger martial brother is becoming more and more critical, the way ahead is dark The color red light is constantly shooting, but they can&rsquo;t get away from each other. On the contrary, they are almost hit by the red light because of their distraction.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was gradually forced to retreat by the wild dog and Liu Hao. Sweat appeared on his forehead, and he gasped for breath. Even his feet were in disorder. He Dazhi was lying on the ground, anxious. He knew that if there was no help, he would die in the hands of these two monsters.</p>
<p>The disciples of dazhufeng have always been very close to each other. They all like Zhang Xiaofan, an honest younger martial brother.</p>
<p>At the moment, he Dazhi clenched his teeth, and Sheng stood up. He took out the magic weapon and wanted to help younger martial brother. But before he could use the magic formula, the evil spirit in his body poured into him. When he fainted, the Venus flashed in front of him, and he fell down again.</p>
<p>When Zhang Xiaofan heard the sound, he turned around in the fierce battle and looked at it. He was shocked and exclaimed, &ldquo;fourth senior brother! &quot;</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, in his distracted moment, the magic weapons of the front dog Taoist and Liu Hao came at the same time. Zhang Xiaofan was unable to respond, and reluctantly put the firecracker in front of him. With a loud bang, the body of the wild dog and Liu Hao was shocked. But Zhang Xiaofan himself was also hit and flew out, falling heavily on the ground.</p>
<p>The wild dog Taoist laughed and flew up with Liu Hao. His fangs and his magic weapon were knocked down in the air, and Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s life was about to be taken. Tian ling&rsquo;er and song Daren and others in the distance lost their voices and exclaimed, but they couldn&rsquo;t rescue them. Seeing Zhang Xiaofan dying here, he Dazhi turned his head and couldn&rsquo;t bear to look again.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, a blue light flashed through the forest, and the blue circle like the water wave suddenly rippled out, which lit up the place in an instant.</p>
<p>He Dazhi was delighted and cried out, &ldquo;Lu&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before he had finished speaking, he saw the figure coming through the air like an arrow from a string. Lu Xueqi came from the sword, his face was cold as frost, but in his eyes, he reflected the blue light of Tianya divine sword in front of him, which seemed to be emitting hot flame and burning continuously.</p>
<p>The wild dog and Liu Hao were shocked. They saw the blue light that was still far away and rushed to their eyes in a twinkling of an eye. They looked as if they had the unmatched momentum of breaking through the mountains and never returning to the dead. In comparison, it is natural that their lives are important, almost coincidentally. They take back their magic weapons and block the Tianya divine sword together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roaring,&rdquo; said Sha Feishi. The trees in the vicinity of the forest swung violently and leaves fell in succession. The wild dog and Liu Hao fly back and fall behind the elder brother.</p>
<p>Among the fallen leaves, Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s figure gradually appeared. Standing by Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s side, his face may have been affected by the force of the violent earthquake just now, especially pale.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan looked at her, but saw in the night, her face is still as beautiful as amazing. Like a lily in the dark. But in the cool and clear, he saw a faint tenderness.</p>
<p>Thank you very much. &ldquo;Zhang Xiaofan pressed his heart and suddenly jumped, whispering.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi shook her head and said quietly, &ldquo;when I was in danger in the abyss of the dead, you also saved me like this. Why do you say these words? &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was stunned. For a moment, he didn&rsquo;t know what to say. He nodded silently. Lu Xueqi looked at him. Suddenly a smile.</p>
<p>It was a smile among the fallen leaves! Zhang Xiaofan saw in his eyes, as if in the night, only in front of him, melting the ice.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan suddenly shook his head and dared not look at Lu Xueqi again. He grabbed the fire stick and rushed to the elder martial brother who was fighting with the elder brother. Lu Xueqi stood behind him and looked at his back. After a moment of silence, she followed him and caught the wild dog and Liu Hao who were about to stop him.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi joined in. The situation in the field immediately changed. She had a high level of Taoism. She went further after she escaped from the abyss of the dead spirit. In addition, she had Tianya, a divine soldier in her hand. Liu Hao and the wild dog are now two enemies and one enemy, but they still fall.</p>
<p>But in his old age, when he saw Zhang Xiaofan join the battle group, he was afraid of the boy&rsquo;s skill, but he was very afraid of the strange stick in his hand. Sure enough, Zhang Xiaofan came. Then he stopped several red lights with the burning stick, and his face changed unchanged. Song Daren and other people were deeply afraid of the evil spirit of the red devil&rsquo;s eyes, which seemed to have no effect on him at all.</p>
<p>This time, Song Daren and Du Bishu made an empty move. The immortal sword dice immediately greeted the old boss. The old man was furious. However, how could he exert himself to stimulate the red devil &rsquo;s eyes? Zhang Xiaofan was just struggling to block the red light power, but he was not affected by the evil spirit.</p>
<p>For only a moment, the old stool was too much for him. In a hurry, he looked aside and saw that Liu Hao and wild dog, including the beautiful woman, could not go well, so he shouted, &ldquo;go! &quot;</p>
<p>In his scream, red devil&rsquo;s eyes suddenly burst out. Seven or eight red lights came out. Zhang Xiaofan barely blocked five of them, but the other red lights blocked song Daren and Du Bishu. The elder brother took advantage of this gap, turned around and left, while several people in the blood refining hall in the distance also went back.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi snorted, regardless of the song Daren behind, and cried out, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t pursue the poor.&rdquo;. Zhang Xiaofan was surprised and hurried to catch up.</p>
<p>Seeing the blue light of Tianya as electricity, he immediately chased up. The wild dog Taoist who ran at the last thought that the wind was chilly at the back, and his hair stood up on his back. He could not help shouting, &ldquo;help! &quot;</p>
<p>The eldest brother and others were shocked and hurried back. But just then, behind all the people in the blood refining hall, deep in the dark forest, a white light flashed and a white flower came out.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan stood at the back and stopped. For a moment, he was dumb.</p>
<p>The white flowers flashed in the air again and again. In a flash, the white light swept over the place. It seemed that countless white petals had been turned into a rain of flowers. Like a sea of quiet flowers, it rushed to Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s blue light sword.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s Tianya divine sword does not retreat at all, and rushes straight up. In an instant, the two magic lights and treasures collide.</p>
<p>Time, as if in that moment, stopped a minute of time.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, the invisible but strong air wave rushed out from the two magic weapons. Taking the two magic weapons as the center, it rushed to all directions. The leaves were like rain, but they were blown up into the sky. However, several people on the ground retreated a few steps.</p>
<p>After a long time, the cold wind gradually quieted down. Lu Xueqi floats back to stand beside Zhang Xiaofan. Zhang Xiaofan looks at her and sees that her face seems to be a little white again, as if even her blood color is gone.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi seems to feel Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s worry, looks at him and shakes her head slightly, saying that she is OK. Zhang Xiaofan turned his head and looked ahead.</p>
<p>In the dark, the white flower slowly turned in the middle of the sky, and then gradually fell down. Four times silent, but suddenly a white jade hand like snow, stretching out from the dark, gently grasped the &ldquo;sad flower&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan suddenly felt that his heart had jumped again.</p>
<p>Biyao came out of the darkness quietly and quietly. There was a respectful color on the faces of the elder brother and others. But Biyao didn&rsquo;t even look at them. She only looked at Zhang Xiaofan deeply. Then she moved her eyes to Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s face next to him and looked carefully.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s eyes did not retreat at all, but also looked at the beautiful woman opposite.</p>
<p>In the field, no one spoke, and the atmosphere suddenly fell silent from the fierce fighting just now, as if there were still some hidden embarrassment.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan looked at BI Yao and Lu Xueqi, only to find that his mouth was dry. Unexpectedly, at this time, the footsteps sounded quietly, but it was Tian linger who came to him. He looked strangely at Lu Xueqi and Bi Yao, who were looking at each other, and said to Zhang Xiaofan, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter with Xiao Fan? &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was startled, but he didn&rsquo;t really understand. He felt embarrassed and strange subconsciously, and was asked by Tian linger. For a while, he didn&rsquo;t know why.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just Tian ling&rsquo;er&rsquo;s question. Biyao and Lu Xueqi suddenly look at her at the same time. Those two quiet eyes pass Tian ling&rsquo;er&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>Tian ling&rsquo;er was shocked and took a step back subconsciously. However, Lu Xueqi was in the same family with her, so she said to Lu Xueqi, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter, senior sister Lu? &quot;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi was silent for a moment, turned around and whispered, &ldquo;nothing. &quot;</p>
<p>At the same time, the front of the Baguio also turned away.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan is stunned at the spot, suddenly wakes up and scolds himself. It&rsquo;s really inexplicable. Now everyone is in danger here, but he is still stunned at the spot. It&rsquo;s really damned. Then he whispered to Tian ling&rsquo;er and Lu Xueqi, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go! There are too many demons on this island. &quot;</p>
<p>A cold hum, with a thin anger, but is standing in front of the green Yao issued.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan did not dare to look at her, but turned back. Lu Xueqi looked at Biyao in front of her again, and then went back with Tian ling&rsquo;er. Song Daren and other people came back, picked up the injured he Dazhi, and said, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go. &quot;</p>
<p>After that, he turned around and was ready to go to the seaside. Behind them, the wild dog was eager to try, but he was caught by the elder brother and whispered, &ldquo;miss Biyao is here. Don&rsquo;t mess with the milk. Listen to her. &quot;</p>
<p>Hearing this, Biyao was still unmoved, only watching the people of Qingyun gate withdraw from their side.</p>
<p>And her figure, motionless.</p>
<p>In the distance, in the direction of the sea where Zhang Xiaofan and others retreated, there was a long roar suddenly. This time, however, it was far from the howl before this night. It was like a dragon chant, going up for nine days and moving all over the country.</p>
<p>There was a faint thunder, but it seemed to come from the deep sea.</p>
<p>Biyao stood in place, suddenly looked up, only to feel a cool face, a drop of water, fell on her face.</p>
<p>There was a wind and it began to rain. (to be continued.</p>
