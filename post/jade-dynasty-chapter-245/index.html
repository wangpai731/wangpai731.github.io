      <p>As the world went on, the smooth bundle seemed to be awakened, brighter and brighter, echoing something.</p>
<p>On the platform, Mr. ghost&rsquo;s body moved for a moment. He seemed to feel something, but he was not sure. After a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, he slowly opened his eyes and looked up to the Fulong Ding.</p>
<p>After a slight movement of his body, he slowly woke up from a confused void, turned over and sat up on the bed. However, he seemed to feel dizzy. It is extremely rare that he could still have such a situation with his high moral conduct at this time. However, GUI Li didn&rsquo;t seem to care about it at all. He settled down and took a long breath. He turned around and was stunned. He saw a jade plate lying on the ground of the stone chamber, emitting soft white light. It was the samsara plate of heaven and earth. The monkey Xiaohui also squatted on the edge of the jade plate, which seemed to be quite curious about the jade plate. He looked left and right, and tried to reach out to touch the jade plate several times, but every time he reached half of it, he shrank back, as if he was afraid of the jade plate.</p>
<p>He frowned and thought for a while, but he couldn&rsquo;t remember whether he had dropped the jade plate to the ground. Not only that, but also he felt a little vague about how he came back from the cold stone room. I think it was because he was so disappointed and mentally depressed just now! GUI Li was silent. Then he laughed bitterly and sighed. He went down the stairs gently and bent down to pick up the heaven and earth samsara plate on the ground. Xiao Hui sat on the ground and looked up at GUI Li. His three eyes were divine, and he didn&rsquo;t know what he was thinking.</p>
<p>GUI Li gently waved to the monkey and said, &ldquo;come here, little ash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Hui &ldquo;squeaked&rdquo; twice and jumped over to Gui Li. However, it still seemed that he had some taboo on GUI Li&rsquo;s reincarnation plate. Finally, he didn&rsquo;t stay in Gui Li&rsquo;s arms. Instead, he jumped onto GUI Li&rsquo;s shoulder, sat down, and then looked at the jade plate in Gui Li&rsquo;s hand from time to time.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t think much about it. Reach out to touch the body of small ash, the only monkey in this world is always accompanied by him. After a while, his eyes fell on the samsara plate, white soft light. The jade plate is still the same as before. In the center of the jade plate, the countless small pieces of jade are still gliding along their own magic and unique tracks. It seems that nothing has happened at all.</p>
<p>GUI Li stares at the jade plate in his hand.</p>
<p>The white brilliance of the jade plate also sprinkled on his face, but he didn&rsquo;t know what the secret was, which was hidden deeply.</p>
<p>After watching for a long time, he finally shook his head gently. A trace of disappointment flashed on his face. He took the black cloth and wrapped the heaven and earth reincarnation plate and put it back in his arms. Lying on the shoulder of GUI Li, Xiao Hui has been looking at the action of GUI Li. When he sees GUI Li putting the jade plate back into his arms, Xiao Hui suddenly &ldquo;squeaks&rdquo;.</p>
<p>He turned his head and was puzzled. Frown: &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter, Xiao Hui?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Hui grabs his head, but it seems that he can&rsquo;t tell what&rsquo;s wrong or important. He has to spread his hands and shrug his shoulders. GUI Li reached out and patted Xiao Hui&rsquo;s head, but he didn&rsquo;t care too much. After sitting for a while, he suddenly said, &ldquo;Xiao Hui, how long have I been on the trip just now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Hui&rsquo;s three eyes turned, and his mouth was squeaking. At the same time, both hands stroked at it for a while, and then slowly said, &ldquo;after such a long time, let&rsquo;s go out for a walk.&rdquo; He pauses. He stood up, and at the same time, he held Xiaohui in his arms and touched it gently. His face was a little gloomy, but he took a long breath and said faintly: &ldquo;no matter what, we still have to live, right?&rdquo; Xiao Hui&rsquo;s three eyes are dripping and rolling. I don&rsquo;t know if he understood the meaning of the words, but he didn&rsquo;t have the spirit to think about it. He patted Xiaohui on the back, and Xiaohui climbed onto his shoulder, and then he walked to the stone gate. In the deep sound of the right door opening, they went out. Outside the stone chamber, the four channels were still extending to both sides, but those cracks were more and more dense and thick Sewing, however, strongly reminds people here that the unknown strange existence and danger. GUI Li stood at the door for a while, his eyes fell on the cracks in the passage.</p>
<p>Some of these cracks have been extremely large, straight from the top of the passage to the ground, revealing gray rocks. After these cracks appear, the original hard stone wall seems to be as weak as thin paper. Ghouli walked slowly to a crack on the side of the stone wall. He looked at it for a long time.</p>
<p>Then he looked up at the top of the passage and frowned slightly. These cracks appeared in large numbers only after he left Huqi mountain last time. Naturally, he could not see clearly for a moment. However, when he was in the cold ice stone chamber before, he clearly remembered that the mysterious power suddenly appeared. Its source was deep underground, but when he looked at the cracks in the surrounding stone walls, he could not see them clearly However, the damage to the top of the passage was the most serious, followed by the stone walls on both sides, and a trace of impatience passed under his feet. It seemed that he was in a bad mood. Although these cracks looked very strange, he really did not have the heart to study them. Calm down, ghost will no longer look around those crisscross cracks, with small ash to one side of the passage.</p>
<p>The passage extends all the way. What&rsquo;s different from usual is that it&rsquo;s much quieter here than usual. It seems that all the disciples of the ghost King clan would rather hide in their own rooms than go out to walk around. In the huge passage, there is only a figure of GUI Li.</p>
<p>However, GUI Li obviously didn&rsquo;t care about this. Seeing that he was walking towards the entrance of the cave, he didn&rsquo;t know if he was too upset and wanted to go out for a walk.</p>
<p>The ghostly footstep sound reverberates in the passage, because it is too quiet and appears to be much louder than usual. Monkey small ash lies on his shoulder, seems to be a little unaccustomed to this kind of excessive quiet, head turns around, looks around.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Xiao Hui&rsquo;s head stopped and looked forward. He felt something at the same time. He stopped and looked at the front. He saw that the empty passage was still empty. But after a while, there was Tokyo, but a black figure floated over quietly.</p>
<p>It was the mysterious Mr. ghost.</p>
<p>At the same time, Mr. ghost saw GUI Li standing alone in front of him, which seemed to be a certificate and stopped. They looked at each other for a while, but they didn&rsquo;t speak. The atmosphere in the passage was rather cold and embarrassed. Finally, Mr. ghost said faintly, &ldquo;when did you come back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just came back soon,&rdquo; he said indifferently</p>
<p>Mr. ghost nodded and seemed to have nothing to say. Anyway, he also said a word. Even if he had said hello, he walked slowly forward. GUI Li quietly let go to a side.</p>
<p>But when Mr. ghost passed by Gui Li, he suddenly stopped. Seeing his behavior, he seemed to have some hesitation which is rarely seen in other days. He pondered for a moment and then said, &ldquo;do you mean you just came back soon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the matter? &quot;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost hesitated for a moment. He seemed to be weighing his words in his heart and said slowly, &ldquo;then you Have you noticed Is there anything wrong with this? &quot;</p>
<p>GUI Li took a look at Mr. ghost and said, &ldquo;what do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost was silent again and shook his head. Light way: &ldquo;no, nothing. I&rsquo;ll go first.&rdquo; With that, he went straight ahead without saying a word.</p>
<p>GUI Li looked at his figure from behind, only to see Mr. ghost&rsquo;s black figure gradually moving away in the passage. At first glance, it seemed like a ghost, but his figure was much slower than before.</p>
<p>In Gui Li&rsquo;s eyes, Mr. ghost is slow. Moreover, the walking direction is not a straight line. From time to time, he leans to both sides of the stone wall. Especially when he comes to the place where the stone chamber lives, Mr. ghost will intentionally or unintentionally approach the stone chamber door and stop for a while before moving on.</p>
<p>Somehow, it seems to be looking for something?</p>
<p>GUI Li turns around indifferently. Even if Mr. ghost really wants to look for something, he will not care about it at all. Along the original direction, GUI Li continued to move forward. This time, I didn&rsquo;t meet anyone on the way again, and I soon got to the entrance of the cave.</p>
<p>When the ghost came out of the hole, a ray of sunshine, with a bit of warmth. On his face. He narrowed his eyes slightly and breathed deeply. In the sunshine, in the light, it seemed that the stone in his heart was finally a little lighter.</p>
<p>Qingyunshan. Tongtian peak.</p>
<p>As the days went by, the Taoist priest of Qingyun sect never appeared again. As Ju Qing, the leader of Taoism, this was not a trivial matter. Xiao Yicai, the elder disciple who had been hiding the matter, was under increasing pressure.</p>
<p>At the gate of Qingyun, there are various schools of justice who come to inquire about it from time to time. Those are all perfunctory. However, there are many factions in Qingyun gate. Immortal daoxuan didn&rsquo;t really transfer the position of the leader of Taoism to Xiao Yicai. He dealt with many things. Xiao Yicai was quite troublesome. All the veins of Qingyun gate have always focused on tongtianfeng. We have seen that the leader sect of Qingyun sect has been silent for many days. However, the news from changmen is that it is closed. In the end, Xiao Yicai and others simply say that immortal Xuan has gone out to relax himself, and no one knows the whereabouts of his old man.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to blame Xiao Yicai. Among the thousands of people in Qingyun gate, only master Shuiyue and Lu Xueqi of xiaozhufeng are really aware of this situation. However, Dazhu Fengtian and Su Ru, who were originally very helpful, passed away one after another. Master Shuiyue and Lu Xueqi did not say that how others would know the big secret of the day in Qingyun gate, they had to ask Xiao Yicai.</p>
<p>At this time, Xiao Yicai showed a tired look, and the whole person seemed to have lost weight. His vigorous and energetic appearance in the past is quite different. You can imagine how much pressure he is bearing on his shoulders at the moment.</p>
<p>However, he was still unable to rest. In the Yuqing Hall of Tongtian peak where he was, the other six veins of Qingyun gate couldn&rsquo;t bear it any longer. They made an appointment to come to tongtianfeng to pursue what happened to the master master master and why he didn&rsquo;t show up for such a long time.</p>
<p>Most of the first ones were present, but the first master of water moon in xiaozhufeng did not come. Lu Xueqi, the most famous disciple of her family, was not present. However, Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s elder sister Wen Min was here. Most of the other leaders are sitting in the middle. One of the most striking is the first seat of dazhufeng, which was finally taken over by the eldest disciple song Daren.</p>
<p>In the crowd, song Daren is still wearing mourning clothes. He is obviously still filial to his master and his wife. His face is rather gloomy. Occasionally, his eyes pass through the crowd. Unexpectedly, he sees Wen Min of xiaozhufeng standing opposite him and nods to him gently.</p>
<p>Song Daren was silent. He moved his mouth slightly and forced a smile at Wen Min, but he soon lowered his head. Obviously, he was still immersed in grief. Wen Min&rsquo;s eyes flashed a little sad, and her face was a little gloomy.</p>
<p>Although today&rsquo;s gathering is a gathering of six channels, it is not song Daren and Qi Hao who are the second generation young disciples who have recently taken over the first place. Zeng Shuchang, the first seat of fenghuifeng, naturally took the lead. They asked Xiao Yicai questions one after another.</p>
<p>Although Xiao Yicai usually deals with the daily affairs of the family for some time. But in the end, immortal daoxuan didn&rsquo;t give him the position of leader, so he had to stand in front of the heads of these veins to reply. There was no seat. At the moment, the chair belonging to the leader of Qingyun gate in the center of the hall was empty. Xiao Yicai stood by the big chair, with a bitter smile on his face, answering questions from all people one by one.</p>
<p>Just ask to ask, although the atmosphere is not good, but still can not ask why.</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai insisted that he didn&rsquo;t know where the real master daoxuan was going. In fact, he really did not know. He could only say that the real person of Zhangjiao Taoism had a profound understanding of Taoism. Maybe the day before yesterday, he was touched by his soul and went out for a journey.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to believe these words. Immortal daoxuan has been in charge of teaching for many years, and has never traveled without leaving any news. However, Xiao Yicai&rsquo;s reply is so overwhelming that he can&rsquo;t force him to say that he can&rsquo;t do it now?</p>
<p>The inquiry went from morning to sunrise. All the people said it was dry, and Xiao Yicai was even more exhausted. But in the end, he still gave the same reply as at the beginning. All the Qingyun disciples looked at each other. After half a sound, Zeng Shuchang, the head of fenghuifeng peak, stood up first, his face full of anger and snorted coldly, and the Buddha went away.</p>
<p>When the leaders went, Qi Hao and song Daren were called by these martial uncles and uncles to make up the number. Naturally, they followed and left.</p>
<p>Looking at the figure of the same door leaving in the field, Xiao Yi slowly breathes a sigh of relief. Suddenly his body swayed, and there was a sense of emptiness. Fortunately, he had a deep foundation, and then stabilized his body. &ldquo;Master, what&rsquo;s the matter with you? If you don&rsquo;t come, I can&rsquo;t stand it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai&rsquo;s heart is full of bitterness here, and song Daren goes out with the crowd there. One of the disciples of dazhufeng was in the mourning period, so no one followed him. He walked out of the Yuqing hall in silence. The scene he saw just now reminded him of his master&rsquo;s passing away. Song Daren was even more bitter in his heart. He really didn&rsquo;t want to stay here for half a minute. He just wanted to leave here quickly.</p>
<p>But he walked out of the Yuqing hall, and after stepping down the stone steps, he just wanted to walk across the Hongqiao to the sea of clouds and go back to the mountain from there. Suddenly, he heard someone call him &ldquo;Da Ren.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren looks back, but xiaozhufeng Wenmin stands aside and beckons to him. Song Daren&rsquo;s heart warms slightly and walks over. Looking at his haggard appearance, Wen Min&rsquo;s heart is also sour. As soon as he wants to say something, he stops trying to say something. Seeing that there are people walking by who are not talking, Wen Min winks at Song Daren and walks forward.</p>
<p>Song Daren understood and followed her across the Hongqiao to the broad sea of clouds platform. They went to a remote place beside them. When they saw no one around, Wen Min said, &ldquo;are you ok?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren gave a bitter smile and hung his head and said, &ldquo;you know my situation, alas&hellip;&rdquo; With a long sigh, he bowed his head and said, &ldquo;however, there are still many younger martial brothers under me. If I don&rsquo;t bear this burden, they will be even more miserable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wen Min&rsquo;s eyes are slightly red, and suddenly reaches out and holds song Daren&rsquo;s big hand in the palm. Song Daren is surprised and looks up at her.</p>
<p>Wen minrou said in a voice: &ldquo;Daren, you are their senior brother. Now you have taken on the burden of the head of dazhufeng. You have to take care of your younger martial brothers. Although it is harder, you have to support yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren only felt that his hands were soft and moist, and there was a faint fragrance coming from the woman in front of him. His eyes were even more gentle. He could not help but reduce the pain in his heart. He gently clenched Wen Min&rsquo;s hand, nodded and said, &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wen Min nods and smiles at him. Although they don&rsquo;t see each other for a long time, their feelings seem to be getting deeper. Song Daren is silent for a moment and says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here. I&rsquo;ve come to ask the master and his wife to take charge of them and ask them to ask Uncle Shuiyue to marry him. However, I&rsquo;m really&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before he finished speaking, he suddenly put a long white finger on his lips and stopped his conversation. Song Daren raised his eyes to Wen Min, and Wen Min said in a soft voice: &ldquo;I understand that this situation is not the time to think about these things. You can rest assured to go back to the mountain. After this period of time, we will discuss it. Anyway, my intention is You know that, too Speaking of the back, Wen Min has a slight red cheek. The voice went down.</p>
<p>Song Daren&rsquo;s heart moved, inexplicably a stream of blood surged up, can&rsquo;t help but step on the Yi people want to embrace in his arms. Wen Min, however, was startled by him and quickly stepped back. Angry way: &ldquo;fool, not afraid of people to see ah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren woke up and looked around in a twinkling of an eye. Sure enough, he saw that although the place where they were standing was remote and uninhabited, there were still many Qingyun disciples in the distance above the sea of clouds. Although no one has noticed it for the time being, it is hard to say that people will not &ldquo;occasionally&rdquo; look at it. Song Daren said with a smile, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m wrong. I&rsquo;m confused.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Looking at his appearance, Wen Min suddenly felt a little impatient to get up. He gave him a blank look and said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t blame you anymore. Why do you look like this.</p>
<p>Now is the situation is not good, in the future as long as we have the intention, will eventually be together. Do you know, idiot</p>
<p>Song Daren nodded and said in a low voice, &ldquo;Xiaomin, you are very kind to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wen Min looks at him again, but looking at his expression, she can&rsquo;t help but smile, and song Daren also laughs. The two stood together for a moment of tenderness and honey. Although their bodies were still like the eve of the storm, they had good expectations for the future in the end.</p>
<p>Come here. Half a ring. Wen Min whispered, &ldquo;I should go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although song Daren did not give up, he also knew that he could not stay for a long time. He nodded and said, &ldquo;OK. Be careful all the way. &quot;</p>
<p>Wen Min took a look at him and said in a soft voice, &ldquo;you should treasure your body. No matter what, you will be fine in the future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren nodded and said, &ldquo;I know, you should also cherish yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wen Min gently grasps his palm. Then he released his hand and turned to the outside of the sea of clouds. Song Daren watched her fly away with his sword and slowly waved at her back until her figure disappeared into the deep sea of clouds and could no longer be seen.</p>
<p>Green sky and white clouds, beautiful mountains and rivers, from the high altitude to the small bamboo peak of Qingyun mountains, the mountains are full of green bamboo forest, beautiful scenery, like a fairyland.</p>
<p>Wen Min falls from the sky and returns to xiaozhufeng. There are several young female disciples running to meet her. One of them says, &ldquo;elder martial sister Wen, master told you to meet her as soon as you come back.&rdquo; If you like this book, please vote for me in Liancheng Book League.</p>
<p>Wen Min nodded and walked forward. At the same time, she asked, &ldquo;master, where is she now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next to a disciple said: &ldquo;master is still in her bamboo grove jingshe, it seems that elder martial sister Xueqi is also there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wen Min was stunned for a moment and said, &ldquo;why is Xueqi with her master?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next to the young female disciple said: &ldquo;yes, this morning after you left, the master called sister Xueqi over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wen Min nodded and said, &ldquo;I know. I&rsquo;ll go right now. You&rsquo;ll be busy with yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>People nearby agreed and walked away with a smile. Wen Min could not help admiring these young and unsophisticated younger martial sisters. Maybe they are more happy simply!</p>
<p>He stood and watched their backs disappear for a long time. Then he sighed and quickened his pace towards master Shuiyue&rsquo;s house in the deep bamboo forest.</p>
<p>The bamboo path is winding, and the green bamboo on both sides is straight and straight. The air seems to take a bit of fragrance. After several corners, the bamboo grove house gradually appears.</p>
<p>Wen Min came to the gate of jingshe, tapped twice on the bamboo door and said, &ldquo;master, disciple Wen Min is here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then came the voice of master Shuiyue in jingshe, and said faintly, &ldquo;come in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With master Shuiyue&rsquo;s voice, the door of jingshe gave out a low &ldquo;creak&rdquo; sound, which was opened. Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s clear figure appeared in front of her eyes, and she gave Wen Min a gentle smile and said, &ldquo;elder martial sister, you are back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wen Min smiles at Lu Xueqi and walks in.</p>
<p>Inside, master Shuiyue sits on a simple bamboo bed. Lu Xueqi walks over and stands beside her. Master Shuiyue takes a look at Wen Min and says, &ldquo;just come back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wen Min respectfully said: &ldquo;yes, I just came back from Tongtian peak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue was silent for a moment, and said faintly, &ldquo;what is the scene on Tongtian peak today? Tell me about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wen Min nodded and said, &ldquo;yes.&rdquo; Then he gave a general account of today&rsquo;s situation. During this period, Xiao Yicai was asked about the situation and was embarrassed to answer, which was not missed.</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue quietly listens to Wen Min and says nothing. Beside her, Lu Xueqi is also expressionless. When she hears Wen Min say Xiao Yicai is in a difficult situation, she can&rsquo;t help but turn her head and look at master Shuiyue. However, master Shuiyue&rsquo;s face is indifferent and seems to have no feeling at all.</p>
<p>Wen Min said for a long time before he roughly finished today&rsquo;s situation, and finally hesitated. &ldquo;Master, there is one more thing I don&rsquo;t know if I should say&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue closed his eyes and seemed to be thinking about something after listening to what Wen Min had just said. Smell speech light way: &ldquo;have what you say!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wen Min said, &ldquo;yes, that disciple said it. Today, six schools gather in tongtianfeng, and the first seat of the other five schools has gone. Only you didn&rsquo;t go. Uncle Zeng of fenghuifeng complained a few words to his disciples, and asked them to tell their master that they were all members of the Qingyun sect and shared the same ancestry. They asked Shifu to stand up and speak. &quot;</p>
<p>With that, Wen Min raised her eyes carefully to see Master Shuiyue. However, she was indifferent, neither angry nor agreed. I just closed my eyes and thought.</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue didn&rsquo;t speak, and Wen Min didn&rsquo;t dare to say anything. After a while, master Shuiyue slowly opened his mouth and said to Wen Min, &ldquo;you just said that except me, all the other five vessels have gone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wen Min was stunned for a moment and nodded: &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue took a look at Wen Min and said, &ldquo;who is dazhufeng?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wen Min&rsquo;s heart leaps. I don&rsquo;t know why master suddenly jumps out of the bamboo peak to ask questions. She hesitates for a moment. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the late Tian Shibo and the elder disciple song Daren</p>
<p>Standing on one side, Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s face darkened quietly, and her eyes were slightly bitter.</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue&rsquo;s face was also a little dim. He sighed and said, &ldquo;in addition to him. Who else has gone to dazhufeng</p>
<p>Wen Min said: &ldquo;all the brothers and sisters of dazhufeng are in mourning, so only elder martial brother song Daren goes there alone. Even elder martial brother song is wearing filial piety clothes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue was silent for a moment and said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not easy for them Are you going to comfort song Daren</p>
<p>Wen Min is startled. On weekdays, master Shuiyue is very strict with his disciples, especially on such matters. Wen Min and song Daren have been secretly in love for many years. It has been a semi public secret. For fear of being blamed by master Shuiyue, master Shuiyue suddenly mentioned that he had cold sweat. After hesitating for a long time, he murmured: &ldquo;master, I, I see elder martial brother song. He is really pitiful, so I feel soft hearted at the moment, so I went up and said something to him. Disciple, I will never violate your teachings. &quot;</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue looks at Wen Min in silence. Wen Min&rsquo;s heart is beating faster and faster. I don&rsquo;t know if she is going to be punished by her master. However, after a while, master Shuiyue suddenly sighed and said, &ldquo;Xiaomin, you don&rsquo;t have to be so afraid. Master doesn&rsquo;t blame you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wen Min almost thought that he had heard something wrong and said, &ldquo;master, what did you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue said faintly: &ldquo;at present, there is filial piety at dazhufeng. It is impossible in a short time. After a while, you can ask song Daren to propose marriage. Anyway, he is the first one in the same vein now, which does not insult you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wenmin&rsquo;s voice in Wenmin&rsquo;s mind seemed to be unacceptable. He was so happy that he couldn&rsquo;t speak. However, he didn&rsquo;t understand how his mentor, who had been firmly opposed to this issue, suddenly changed his attitude.</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue sat on the bamboo bed and looked at the disciple in front of him. His face was filled with happiness and surprised smile. He sighed in his heart and thought quietly, &ldquo;maybe she will have more happiness if she has figured it out earlier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi passed by, put her arm around Wen Min&rsquo;s shoulder and gently held her elder martial sister. Her eyes were full of happy light for her. She said in a soft voice, &ldquo;Congratulations, elder martial sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wen Min is excited, can&rsquo;t help but a little red eyes, eyes full of tears, quickly wipe with his hand.</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue looked in his eyes. He was angry and funny. He said angrily, &ldquo;but I promised you. How can I be so happy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wen Min was embarrassed and blushed. He bowed down to master Shuiyue and said in a low voice, &ldquo;thank you for your great kindness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master wenrou shook her head for a long time</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi helped Wen Min up from the side. Master Shuiyue looked at Wen Min with soft eyes and said, &ldquo;Master Shifu can&rsquo;t make decisions for you in the future. In the future, you should learn to take care of yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wen Min&rsquo;s heart is suddenly sour. For a long time, she regarded master Shuiyue as a teacher and mother. She couldn&rsquo;t help sobbing in a low voice.</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue waved his hand and said, &ldquo;well, you are tired after running back and forth today. Go back and have a rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wen Min&rsquo;s voice choked and said, &ldquo;yes, I quit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She said, slowly retreating out. Lu Xueqi followed her and sent him far away. And that&rsquo;s how it came back.</p>
<p>In the jingshe, the master and the apprentice were silent. After half a ring, master Shuiyue suddenly gave a bitter smile. &ldquo;I used to be wrong, she suffered from this Acacia, also hurt you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi went to kneel down in front of master Shuiyue and said in a low voice, &ldquo;master, we are all raised by you. To educate adults, we are the only ones who have made mistakes. We dare not have the slightest resentment against master. &quot;</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue reached out his hand and gently stroked Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s dark and soft hair. He sighed and said, &ldquo;get up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi answered and stood up. Master Shuiyue closed his eyes and didn&rsquo;t speak any more.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi was silent for a while, and suddenly said, &ldquo;master, I have something to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue opened his eyes and looked at him. Complexion heavy face, light way: &ldquo;you want to say the matter of Tongtian peak where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi nodded: &ldquo;yes.</p>
<p>Today, both Tian Shibo and Su Shibo of dazhufeng have died one after another, while master daoxuan is</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s really hard to go back. Why don&rsquo;t we tell the truth to other students? Even for the sake of the face of Qingyun gate, we should at least inform elder martial brother Xiao Yicai, who is the first one in Tongtian peak of the other six veins. &quot;</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue was silent for a moment and said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re right. I&rsquo;ve thought about these.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi was stunned and said, &ldquo;master, how can you return it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue gave a bitter smile. &ldquo;You mean I didn&rsquo;t tell them since I thought about it? Have you ever thought, silly child, how many people will believe us after we say this? &quot;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi was stunned and speechless. I couldn&rsquo;t speak for a moment.</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue sighed and said, &ldquo;as you said just now, there are thousands of people in Qingyun gate. The only people who know the secret are you, Mr. Tian, uncle Su, Shishi and you. Now they are both dead. Only the two of us know about it. But even if we say it out, do you think that there will be people in Qingyun gate who believe it? Will anyone believe that our ancient sword for killing immortals contains evil spirit? Would you believe that the real person of Zhangjiao, who has a profound understanding of Taoism and saved the world for several times, has become a violent and murderous demon?</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi was speechless.</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue said in a low voice: &ldquo;this secret should have been passed down only among the masters of the past generations. To tell you the truth, none of the people in Qingyun gate will believe it. What&rsquo;s more, we don&rsquo;t have any evidence, so how can we say it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi clenched his teeth and said in a half loud, astringent voice, &ldquo;but now, in this situation, I&rsquo;m afraid that the matter of master daoxuan can&rsquo;t be covered up sooner or later. Even if we don&rsquo;t say it, I&rsquo;m afraid that one day he will suddenly run out by himself. What should we do</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue sighed and closed his eyes and said, &ldquo;what should I do? I don&rsquo;t know what to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi was speechless and fell into silence.</p>
<p>Outside the house, the green bamboo grove sways gently with the wind, making waves of pleasant bamboo waves, and the scenery is pleasing to the eyes; but in the bamboo grove cottage in the forest, it seems to be more and more depressed.</p>
<p>Huqishan, ghost King clan.</p>
<p>However, in the next round, there was no change in the next round except for the round of heaven and earth.</p>
<p>Each time is like a small stone straight fall in the jade plate.</p>
<p>Although ghost calendar does not give up, still holding in case of hope to try, but waiting for him is just countless failures. In the early days, the ghost King often waited in the cold stone room, but after witnessing many failures, he seemed to give up earlier than the ghost calendar, and came less and less times. In recent days, he has never come at all.</p>
<p>Perhaps, for the ghost king, watching the ghost calendar failure again and again, for him, it is a more painful thing!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pa&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a slight ringing and a slight echo, the bell of Albizzia once again fell from the sky and landed in the center of the samsara plate of heaven and earth. After a few turns, it stops.</p>
<p>Ghost calendar face has no expression, even lost hope seems to have numb, he did not continue to try, sat in silence for a while, then put away the heaven and earth samsara plate, put the Huan bell back to Dao Biyao&rsquo;s hand carefully.</p>
<p>He deeply gazed at the quiet face of Biyao. Ten years later, she was still so beautiful. Just like when we met at the beginning of that year, even the faint smile on the corner of her mouth could make him recall countless deep engraved memories.</p>
<p>Only. Only the cold of her skin at the tentacle, coldly indicates the difference between the ghost calendar reality and the past.</p>
<p>Ghost calendar stood up in silence, took a deep look at the green jade, and moved the corners of his mouth. However, he did not say anything, and then slowly turned around and left the cold stone room.</p>
<p>Outside the cold stone room, the channel is still empty, ghost calendar along the channel slowly go. The cracks on the stone walls on both sides of the passage seem to be more and deeper. However, in the eyes of ghost calendar, none of them left a moment&rsquo;s reaction. He just walked quietly.</p>
<p>Behind the ghost calendar, in the other direction of the passage, in a shadow corner, the ghost king stood silently and watched the young man go farther and farther. The ghost king didn&rsquo;t go up to ask about the situation in the cold stone room of the ghost calendar. For so many years, he could even know the situation of Biyao from a casual movement of the ghost calendar.</p>
<p>Is there no hope after all?</p>
<p>The ghost King&rsquo;s face passed a trace of gloom. Turn around and walk into the darkness.</p>
<p>When he appeared again, he was already in the blood pool deep in the cave. He walked slowly to the platform of the blood pool. As he thought, Mr. GUI&rsquo;s black figure was still standing there alone and pondering. The half empty Fulong Ding was also suspended, but under the red light of the sky, the mysterious white light column on the ancient tripod could be seen It&rsquo;s much brighter than before, and the devil&rsquo;s face on the ancient tripod. The blood gas retreated a few minutes, more twisted and ferocious.</p>
<p>The ghost King&rsquo;s heart suddenly jumped up a inexplicable anger, his hands could not help but grip, the most beloved daughter did not improve. Now even the blood array of four spirits, which has consumed painstaking efforts, is still at a standstill because of the inexplicable prohibition of ancient divine law.</p>
<p>The ghost Mr. in front of seems to feel something, the body move, slowly turn over, through the black veil on the face, light way: &ldquo;you come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost King took a deep breath. This will be the heart of that anger in the murderous spirit slowly pressure down, the face returned to normal, walked in the past, the way: &ldquo;how, can you figure out what way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost shook his head in silence.</p>
<p>Although he had expected the answer, the ghost king was still angry. Recently, he seems to be particularly prone to anger and murder. If Mr. GUI was not an indispensable character in the blood array of the four spirits, the ghost king would have dealt with him.</p>
<p>The ghost King De&rsquo;s expression changes naturally can&rsquo;t escape the ghost Mr. a pair of eyes, but the ghost Mr. actually does not seem to care about these, only light way: &ldquo;give me some time, you have been waiting so long, how about waiting a little more?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost King&rsquo;s body was shocked and seemed to be shocked. After a long time, he regained his composure and nodded his head slowly: &ldquo;what you said is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, he hesitated for a moment. He seemed to notice that his look was too much. He forced a smile and said, &ldquo;these days, I&rsquo;ve been treating Biyao with GUI Li, but I&rsquo;m still the same. I&rsquo;m in a bad mood. Don&rsquo;t worry about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost shook his head and said, &ldquo;father and daughter love each other deeply, I understand.&rdquo; After a pause, he slowly turned around and looked at the Fu Long Ding floating in the air, especially the mysterious beam of light. At the same time, he said casually, &ldquo;miss Biyao still hasn&rsquo;t improved. What methods have you tried these years?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost King sighed and said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s it. Although GUI Li doesn&rsquo;t agree with me very well, he has nothing to say about his affection for Biyao.</p>
<p>Recently, I did not know where I went to find another strange magic weapon to cure Biyao. At first, it seemed to have some effect, and it could echo the Huanhuan bell. Unexpectedly, at the critical time of the day, the underground blood array magic power suddenly started, and under the change, there was no effect&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>The ghost king said it unintentionally. He was stunned and lost in his mind. He thought of his daughter lying on the cold stone platform. He felt a faint pain in his heart, so that he didn&rsquo;t notice that the ghost master beside him suddenly shook his body, as if the whole person was frozen.</p>
<p>After a while, Mr. ghost&rsquo;s voice seemed to be as flat as before. He said quietly, &ldquo;Oh? What&rsquo;s the shape of the treasure brought by the ghost</p>
<p>The ghost King&rsquo;s heart was still a little gloomy and said casually, &ldquo;it looks like a jade plate. It looks quite warm and moist. There are some strange patterns carved on it. There are many small pieces of jade in the middle of the most strange jade plate. There are some strange words in it. They slide on their own and never collide with each other&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>The ghost king said here, suddenly frowned and said to Mr. GUI, &ldquo;Why are you suddenly interested in this matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost, with his back to him, still looked like a dragon tripod floating in the air. After a long silence, he only heard him say quietly: &ldquo;nothing. I just want to ask. &quot; (to be continued. )</p>
