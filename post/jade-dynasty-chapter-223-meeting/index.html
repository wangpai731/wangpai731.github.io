      <p>At the moment, the whole body was covered with a layer of dust. It seemed that he had been lying in that coffin for a long time. Some of the original daoguxianfeng had disappeared.</p>
<p>Xiaobai looked him up and down. Naturally, he didn&rsquo;t think about the boring question of whether Zhouxian was going to lie in the coffin. He said, &ldquo;how could you be in the coffin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Monday fairy wry smile, way: &ldquo;I was naturally caught and thrown in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The small white eye wave circulates, looked to that small black room one eye, way: &ldquo;that you next to those two coffins are who, do you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Monday fairy nodded and said, &ldquo;on the left is my granddaughter Xiaohuan, on the right is a wild dog Taoist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaobai snorted and glanced at Zhouxian. He was a little embarrassed, but he didn&rsquo;t care about his face at the moment. He quickly bowed to Xiaobai and begged, &ldquo;this immortal, this one, you have mercy. Since you have saved my husband, you can also save them both.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaobai shrugged his shoulders and took two steps towards the room. Suddenly, he frowned, as if he had thought of something. He turned to look at Zhouxian. He looked at Zhouxian a little more strange.</p>
<p>Zhou Yixian was a little uneasy when she saw her. She said with a dry smile, &ldquo;what do you want me to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaobai stares at him and says, &ldquo;what did you call me just now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Monday Fairy &ldquo;ah&rdquo; a, a step backward, face showing regret color.</p>
<p>Xiaobai looked at him carefully again, and said faintly, &ldquo;I underestimate you. I can see through my identity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Monday fairy was bitter and repeatedly arched his hands and said, &ldquo;girl, you see, the old man didn&rsquo;t mean anything else. He just said something he shouldn&rsquo;t have said. Forgive me, girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaobai in this period of time, carefully and secretly observe Monday immortal, but found that the old man&rsquo;s feet are light, lack of Qi and blood. It&rsquo;s true that he is not a man of profound Taoism, but somehow he has such a keen eye that he is much sharper than many famous practitioners in the past.</p>
<p>Xiaobai&rsquo;s thoughts change here. There Monday fairy is a little more anxious, but helpless, or had to accompany a smile to the small white way: &ldquo;girl, you have a good heart, or save people first?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaobai Leng hummed and took a glance at Monday immortal.</p>
<p>Monday fairy was silent and stepped back quietly. He wanted to say something more, but Xiaobai&rsquo;s figure suddenly flickered, but he had already drifted into the dark cabin. After a while, he heard the roar and the strange whine came out of the room.</p>
<p>Later, Monday fairy only felt the darkness in front of him and called out &ldquo;ah ah&rdquo;. At once, he ran and ran away. He saw two coffins which were still on the ground just now. Xiaobai threw them out of the hut. &ldquo;Bang bang&rdquo; two loud noises, with a huge roar, hit the ground.</p>
<p>In an instant, the courtyard was dusty again and the debris was flying, which was better than that just now. In the misty dust, a moment later came the sound of a man and a woman coughing. Xiao Huan and the figure of the wild dog Taoist priest staggered out of the dust.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a big day on Monday. He quickly welcomed them up and pulled them to the side, asking questions. Xiaobai came out of the hut and stood far away, watching them happy. But her face was obviously a little dignified. From time to time I looked into the dark depths of the hut.</p>
<p>At this time, the dust in the courtyard gradually calmed down, and Xiaobai stood still. However, the three people on the other side of Zhouxian had to get rid of the difficulties. They were all very happy. But now, somehow, they were watching them from a distance. The specific thing should be what Zhou Yixian said, but Xiaohuan was firmly against it. As for the Taoist priest dingou, he just looked at them and what he said They didn&rsquo;t comment.</p>
<p>Xiaobai stood in the distance and looked at them for a long time, but it seemed that they had been unable to coordinate their opinions. He could not help but feel a little curious. He could not help but quietly walked over. He only heard Monday fairy frown and said: &ldquo;OK, don&rsquo;t say it. We will leave this ghost place immediately. Otherwise, if we wait for the devil to come back, we will really die without a burial place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Huan sneered and said, &ldquo;what about that man in there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Monday immortal stayed for a while, and it seemed that he was ashamed. He just refused to admit defeat and said to himself: &ldquo;what do you know about that man? One is that he is under the magic of&rdquo; killing the heart lock &ldquo;. On the other hand, there are other restrictions on the coffin. We can&rsquo;t save him. It&rsquo;s better for us to go first. Otherwise, if the time is delayed and the devil comes back, we will die for nothing. &quot;</p>
<p>Small ring angry way: &ldquo;grandfather, you are nonsense again, that person was caught by that devil just for us, how can we be so ungrateful?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Monday immortal shook his head and said: &ldquo;wrong, wrong. It is true that he was captured that day, but it is nonsense that he was arrested for us. From my point of view, we are not as good as the devil, but the person who helped us is definitely not as good as him. &quot;</p>
<p>Small ring mouth cocked up old Gao, hate hate way: &ldquo;anyway, we can&rsquo;t leave him like this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhou Yixian&rsquo;s brow was tight and his face was bitter. He wanted to persuade the stubborn granddaughter again. Suddenly, Xiao Bai&rsquo;s voice came from his side and said, &ldquo;who is the man you are talking about, and the devil?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan and the wild dog Taoist are both stunned for a moment, and then both shake their heads. Xiaobai looks at Zhouxian, but Zhouxian looks away and says, &ldquo;the three of us are ordinary people. Where do we know about these people, we are scared to death. I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaobai frowned slightly. She didn&rsquo;t know that the girl in front of her and the Taoist who looked strange like a dog beside her didn&rsquo;t know. She didn&rsquo;t doubt it. It was just that the old man Zhouxian was extremely eccentric, which made people murmur in their hearts. Most of them were weird. But Monday immortal insisted that he didn&rsquo;t know. Even if Xiaobai doubted, he had nothing to do. He had to try and say to Xiaohuan: &ldquo;little girl, do you remember what kind of magic weapons the people who helped you and that devil used?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Xiaohuan saw Xiaobai start at the first sight, she was very proud of her beauty. However, in the face of Xiaobai&rsquo;s gorgeous appearance and bewitching all living beings, she had a hint of unspeakable flattery hanging in the corner of her eyes. However, Xiaohuan could not compare with her mature demeanor.</p>
<p>In her heart, she first liked Sanfen. What&rsquo;s more, Xiaobai was the benefactor who saved the three of them. She felt kind. Now she was asked by Xiaobai with a smile. I just feel that the woman&rsquo;s eyes are soft like water. Although she is a woman, she can&rsquo;t help but feel a little bit of thump in her heart and her heart beats faster. Even he was a little nervous and stammered</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, what, what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Standing next to Monday fairy and wild dog Taoist are some accidents, to small ring look, Xiaobai smile, asked again.</p>
<p>Xiaohuan calmed down and scolded himself in his heart. Then he looked down at the ground and said, &ldquo;I know that the man who helped us has a very high moral character. He uses a magic weapon of fairy sword. The whole body is three feet long and the color is red and yellow. It is really powerful to use it. It&rsquo;s like a red flame. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Red flame!&rdquo;</p>
<p>All of a sudden, a voice of amazement, mixed with a little surprise and tension, was actually coming from the door of the villa courtyard. The four people in the field were surprised. Looking back, they saw a woman in white. She was a beautiful woman. She had a light blue sword in her hand. The light and haze were flowing. It was a top-grade treasure. And the woman&rsquo;s face. It seems that it&rsquo;s hard to distinguish Xiao Bai from Xiao Bai, which is also the unique color in the world.</p>
<p>But who is Lu Xueqi who is not xiaozhufeng of Qingyun Mountain?</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>At the foot of Qingyun Mountain, the ruins of Caomiao village.</p>
<p>Under the ruins. In the wild grass, from time to time sounded the sound of insects, in this desolate place, even more desolate.</p>
<p>The night was thick, and the sky was covered with dark clouds, with only a few stars twinkling with faint starlight. Also stubbornly exposed his head, through a little light.</p>
<p>In a corner of the village, a wall which has been dumped for the most part is sitting on the ground with its back against the wall. Beside him, monkey Xiao Hui lay on the ground, with his head resting on his fierce thighs, his limbs spread out and he fell asleep</p>
<p>Ghost Li did not sleep, his eyes are still open, silently staring at the surrounding vegetation, every inch of land, every piece of debris.</p>
<p>This is his hometown, the place where he spent his first years of life, but the time passed by quietly, which eventually turned into memory, leaving only this piece of ruins, which makes people sigh and sigh.</p>
<p>But what is it to live?</p>
<p>He looked at everything around him, then slowly raised his head and looked up at the sky.</p>
<p>The night is low, above the sky, I don&rsquo;t know if there are gods, demons and Buddhas who can listen to the voice of the world?</p>
<p>Monkey small ash&rsquo;s mouth moved a few times, issued &ldquo;tut tut&rdquo; a few times, turned over a body, the head rubbed several times on the ghostly thigh, and then went to sleep.</p>
<p>Maybe you like wild fruit most?</p>
<p>GUI Li takes back his eyes and falls on Xiao Hui. He reaches out his hand and caresses his head gently. The hair on the monkey&rsquo;s head is soft and warm.</p>
<p>His mouth showed a trace of a smile, gentle and simple smile, as if many years ago that youth, in this once village, laugh and shout, run hard!</p>
<p>The night wind is whistling. It seems that someone whispers in the distance. The plants move with the wind, and there is the fragrance of green grass in the wind.</p>
<p>He closed his eyes.</p>
<p>Such a quiet, peaceful night</p>
<p>All of a sudden, monkey Xiaohui&rsquo;s whole body was excited, three eyes suddenly opened together, his head also slightly left the ghostly thigh, slightly raised, as if listening to something. At the same time, the gruesome brow slightly wrinkled up, the corner of the mouth residual that faint smile, quietly disappeared.</p>
<p>In silence, he opened his eyes again, and the world came into view.</p>
<p>He reached out his hand and patted Xiaohui&rsquo;s head. Xiaohui immediately calmed down and turned his head. His three eyes rolled around, but he didn&rsquo;t sleep. He climbed up gently and grabbed his head with his hands. Then he made a slight effort under his feet and jumped onto his fierce shoulder. Then he kept looking around.</p>
<p>GUI Li was still sitting in this secluded corner. In front of him, a broken wall just blocked his body, but the cracks in the broken wall just allowed him to look out.</p>
<p>In such a desolate place, no one will come during the day. Can there be any accident in this dark and windy night?</p>
<p>A strange breath, as if born out of thin air, suddenly fell into the ruins, the ghost sharp intuition felt something, frown more tightly.</p>
<p>It seems that the cold is just like the cold wind in the heart. In the miserable wind that has become strange. A dark shadow fell from the sky and fell quietly in the center of the ruins of Caomiao village.</p>
<p>In the distance, through the gap, peeped at the black figure. However, his heart was really shocked. The evil power contained in this unknown visitor was the only one he had ever seen in his life. Even though it was quite a long distance away, it was at the moment when the shadow fell. He still felt a slight surge of Qi and blood in his whole body.</p>
<p>However, how could such an expert with terrible practice come to the ruins of Caomiao village in the middle of the night?</p>
<p>He had to keep a close eye on the figure.</p>
<p>Soon, he found something strange. He found that the figure was black, not because he was dressed in black, but because his whole body was surrounded by a layer of strange black air which was constantly rolling and surging, so that people could not see his true face.</p>
<p>In the ghost Li&rsquo;s heart is even more doubtful. So he observed the man more carefully and secretly. However, after landing, he did not immediately move. Instead, he stood still for a long time.</p>
<p>At the moment of bewilderment, the shadow suddenly moved again, and then slowly walked forward. Grimly frowned, coldly staring at the figure.</p>
<p>I watched the black figure step on the lawn, and slowly passed through the ruins one after another. The fierce eyes stayed on him and moved quietly.</p>
<p>The black figure did not seem to have any particular purpose. He grew up in Caomiao village since he was young. He is very familiar with the location of Caomiao village, but he can&rsquo;t see where he is going. Just looking at the black figure walking slowly, it seems that I want to look for something.</p>
<p>After a while, the black figure suddenly seemed to find something and stopped. Ghost Li heart move, quickly toward the direction of that person face to check, suddenly in the heart a tight. At the moment, the place where the man in black was facing was the deserted grass Temple.</p>
<p>Wrapped in black air, the man slowly approached the ruined temple, but did not go in, but stopped outside the grass Temple. Looking from the secluded corner behind him, he saw that the man looked up and down at the grass Temple. Suddenly, his hand was lifted, but a sharp roar suddenly rang from his hands.</p>
<p>A moment later, he saw one branch out of the black air around the man, and it turned into a black arrow in the air, and flew out in response to the sound, and rushed to a broken pillar in the small temple.</p>
<p>GUI Li couldn&rsquo;t help but hold his fist, but he still endured, calmed down and looked quietly.</p>
<p>This black gas arrow looks very powerful. In a twinkling of an eye, it bumps into the damaged stone pillar. Hearing only a dull sound of &ldquo;roar&rdquo;, the originally dilapidated stone pillar is smashed, and the stones fly in disorder. But what&rsquo;s more strange is that, at the same time, the place where the stone pillar was originally standing suddenly rises four or five faint lights, and the gloomy atmosphere is miserable, and there are several Ghost.</p>
<p>For a while, the evil spirit around the temple was very strong, and the ghost roared again and again. The ghost who was lurking on the side suddenly understood it, and then his face was angry. At that time, the massacre in Caomiao village implicated more than 200 innocent people&rsquo;s lives wrongly. It is natural that so many people died in vain and their resentment was so deep. But after all, this place is under the eyes of Qingyun gate. In those years, Qingyun gate had sent people down the mountain to settle the anger and let many ghosts who refused to leave return to samsara, which was a compensation to Caomiao village.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t know why, up to now, there are still many ghosts attached to this ruined temple in Caomiao village. No wonder this place has been abandoned for many years, and there is a lot of wild grass, but there is no grass near the Caomiao village.</p>
<p>Ghost Li was thinking about himself, but the next moment he saw that the strange figure of the black figure seemed not to pay attention to these ghosts that ordinary people were afraid of. On the contrary, he put out his hand and simply waved. These ghosts seemed to know how powerful they were and fled to the outside. But like an invisible force, they were all pulled into this mysterious body By the shadow&rsquo;s side, a moment later, in bursts of desperate ghost crying, these ghosts were slowly integrated into the black air surrounding the person.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how, this scene was seen in the eyes, his heart was Huo Ran, as if he was burned, as if the whole body of blood are faintly boiling up. A nameless anger, instantly rushed to the heart.</p>
<p>This is his hometown!</p>
<p>That Cao temple was his childhood paradise!</p>
<p>The next moment, he had already rushed out.</p>
<p>The black figure immediately found the abnormality behind him and turned around quickly. When he saw the man and monkey in front of him, the mysterious figure seemed to be stunned for a moment.</p>
<p>Then, from the rolling black air, it seemed that his strange laughter came out. The voice was so deep and hoarse that it could not be heard clearly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you? Why do you come here to gather ghosts? It&rsquo;s a matter of injuring nature and harming reason. You are not afraid of retribution!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s whole body was filled with black air, and all of a sudden, his whole body was in the air.</p>
<p>The ghost was startled. He knew that although he was strange, his conduct was really very important. He immediately concentrated on his guard. Unexpectedly, the man was an empty move. He swayed in the air, but he turned around and swept away.</p>
<p>He snorted coldly, and without hesitation, he rose from the sky and went after him.</p>
<p>Looking at the direction of the man&rsquo;s escape in the air, he seemed to be heading for the wilderness in the south of Heyang city not far away. He would like to see who this strange guy was?</p>
<p>As for what was waiting for him, he did not think about it.</p>
<p>But who will seriously think about it, and even if you do, will it be useful?</p>
<p>Perhaps, this is like the future, no matter how good or bad, we have to face it after all! (to be continued. )</p>
