<p>After stepping on that mountain, a strong smell was always floating in the air, which was a little choking, with a smell of sulfur. Both GUI Li and Jin Ping&rsquo;er are people of profound cultivation, and can tolerate such peculiar smell. However, as they go deeper into the mountain, the increasingly strong wind gradually makes them frown.</p>
<p>It was a cold and penetrating wind. I don&rsquo;t know how, when it was blowing over my face, although the wind was not so big, it was so gloomy and miserable that it really made me feel cold from the bottom of my heart. In addition, from the depths of the mountains ahead, I don&rsquo;t know where to send out the faint whistling sound, one after another, sometimes high and low, like the night cry of an ape, but also a fierce ghost laugh, listening to the ear is also embarrassed panic.</p>
<p>Monkey Xiao Hui lies on the ghost&rsquo;s shoulder and chews on the last wild fruit. He throws the core, opens his three eyes and looks around. It seems that for him, he is not affected by these visions.</p>
<p>Gold bottle son frown more and more tight, suddenly way: &ldquo;seem to be a bit wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost Li one Zheng, stopped the pace, the way: &ldquo;how?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jin pinger hesitated for a moment and said, &ldquo;the last time I followed here, I didn&rsquo;t have these ghosts crying and howling and wind gusting all over the mountains and fields. Only when I got to the ancient cave, it seemed that there were some. How could it be that after some time, it was just like the ghost prison? &quot;</p>
<p>GUI Li looked at the distance and said, &ldquo;maybe this is the lair of animal spirits. It should be so. When you came over that day, he was just born again. Of course, there is no weather in recent days. &quot;</p>
<p>After thinking about it for a while, the only explanation is this. On that day, at the top of Qingyun Mountain, there was a bloody battle between the beast God and Zhuxian sword array, which was severely damaged by the ancient Zhuxian sword. Anyone can see how powerful that sword is. However, even under the Zhuxian sword array, the beast God can still escape. His practice is enough to shock the world.</p>
<p>Gold bottle son eye wave flow, suddenly said: &ldquo;you say, if we really find the beast God in the ancient hole of the town devil. Although he has been injured, can we really deal with him? &quot;</p>
<p>Ghost Li shook his head and said, &ldquo;how can I know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Golden Vase looks at him. All of a sudden, he said with a smile: &ldquo;look at your appearance. I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s not certain! In that case, what are you doing here with me? &quot;</p>
<p>She looked at GUI Li and said with a smile: &ldquo;don&rsquo;t forget, Huqi mountain.</p>
<p>But there is a Biyao waiting for you to save her! If you die here, don&rsquo;t you feel sorry for her? &quot;</p>
<p>She snorted, walked forward and said, &ldquo;this is what her father ordered me to do. I have to do too much for Biyao. I always have to do something. It&rsquo;s you, &ldquo;he said with a cold smile,&rdquo; if you should die here unfortunately, you&rsquo;d be dead with your eyes closed? &quot;</p>
<p>Golden Vase son is charming smile, smile to his back: &ldquo;Oh! You are such a stranger. As long as we die together, it&rsquo;s good not to say that it&rsquo;s the beast demon&rsquo;s nest, it&rsquo;s a pigsty and a cowshed, and that&rsquo;s good. &quot;</p>
<p>GUI Li sneered at him. He didn&rsquo;t believe Jin Ping&rsquo;er&rsquo;s words, let alone moved. He just went straight. However, the monkey on his shoulder turned his head to the Golden Vase, which was so rare that he opened his mouth and laughed. It seemed that he was in a good mood.</p>
<p>It is different from several women who GUI Li used to associate with. Xiaohui was not as intimate with the two women as Xiaobai and Xiaohuan on that day. After a few days, it was the first time that Xiao Hui grinned so happily.</p>
<p>The Golden Vase is somewhat unexpected. But it&rsquo;s not a bad thing, but also a little happy, full of laughter, was about to go up to tease the monkey, but the monkey just cracked his mouth for a moment, suddenly opened his mouth, but spit out a black thing. The speed is extremely fast, straight to the gold bottle son standing place flies.</p>
<p>Jin pinger was startled, but she was not a normal person after all. She was not flustered. She made a slight rotation at her feet and made her body move aside a few minutes to let the strange thing pass by.</p>
<p>Just listen to a low sound, the thing fell to the ground, actually did not bounce up, but directly hit the ground. The Golden Vase son looked back, but it was a wild fruit stone. I don&rsquo;t know when Xiaohui had one left in her mouth. She tasted the taste, but now she used it to tease her.</p>
<p>Jinpinger was teased by a monkey, and his face turned pale. When he looked across it, he saw that the grey haired monkey had turned around and sat on his fierce shoulder. Facing the Golden Vase, his hands crossed in his chest, his feet swung around and looked at the sky with three eyes. His face was full of arrogance. He had the legendary rogue spirit, even his long tail Dangling back and forth behind me, I was bullying you, I was a hooligan, who I was afraid of.</p>
<p>Gold bottle son does not look good, a look is more angry not to hit a place, tightly walked a few steps to catch up with the ghost, angry way: &ldquo;you this monkey how so uneducated, take the fruit pit spit people at will, you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li slowly turned his head and looked at the Golden Vase. He looked strange and said for a long time, &ldquo;are you calling it a curse?&rdquo; Said pointing to small ash.</p>
<p>The Golden Vase nodded.</p>
<p>Xiao Hui was angry and jumped up from his fierce shoulder. He was squeaking, his eyes were wide open, his hands clenched into fists, and he could not help but draw. It seemed that he was burning with anger. He wanted to fight with the jinpinger who complained, which was very powerful.</p>
<p>Jin Ping&rsquo;er didn&rsquo;t expect that the grey haired monkey had reached such a point of human nature. He was stunned for a moment, took a step back, and then ignored it and said in a loud voice to the ghost: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m scolding it. This animal is really hateful. If you raise it, you should teach it well&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You All of a sudden, GUI Li seldom opened his mouth in a loud voice, and drank a sentence at the same time. At the same time, he interrupted the Golden Vase&rsquo;s words.</p>
<p>Xiaohui was startled and stopped. The Golden Vase was also surprised and looked at the ghost.</p>
<p>The ghost frowned and looked serious. He said to Xiao Hui, &ldquo;I told you that you should read more books so that you can be reasonable. You just don&rsquo;t listen. Why don&rsquo;t you learn the book &ldquo;supernatural, demonic and Zhiyi&rdquo; I taught you last time? Copy it for me and see me again</p>
<p>Xiao Hui&rsquo;s three eyes together widened, blinked and blinked. He touched his head with his hand, scratched and touched again. Obviously, he was in a daze.</p>
<p>However, the other side of the Golden Vase was not much better. After being startled, she couldn&rsquo;t help sneering and said, &ldquo;what nonsense are you talking about? Even if the monkey is human, he has never heard of reading and writing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li turned his head and looked at her, &ldquo;Oh&rdquo; a sound, as if this just wake up, light way: &ldquo;in this case, even if you also say so, the monkey is not my fault without breeding. All things are born. Why can&rsquo;t monkeys read books? Why, why? &quot;</p>
<p>He looked at the Golden Vase and sighed insincerely. Not much more, he turned back and went forward.</p>
<p>Jinpinger was so angry that she turned pale.</p>
<p>In front of the monkey small ash plops, falls from the ghost sharp shoulder, falls to the ground. Instead, it screamed, danced, and laughed wildly. Sometimes it burst into belly and beat the ground. Even its limbs were facing the sky and its tail was waving. In a word, it could laugh as wildly as it could.</p>
<p>The gold bottle son looks more and more angry, is about to attack.</p>
<p>Xiaohui suddenly jumped up, &ldquo;zhizhizhi&rdquo; screamed at the golden bottle, made a big grimace, then landed on all fours and went back with a whoosh and two times, then jumped onto the ghost&rsquo;s shoulder. Then she fell down again, and looked back at the Golden Vase son with elation, and it was another grimace.</p>
<p>The Golden Vase son&rsquo;s anger increased, and even his body seemed to tremble. As soon as she bit her teeth, she raised her hand and wanted to wave it forward. Under the warm sunshine, the edge of her palm was covered with light purple. It&rsquo;s so weird.</p>
<p>But the palm of the hand was lifted to half, but it stopped in the air. Under the figure of the man in front of him, it seemed that the hand also sent out a light blue light.</p>
<p>The pupils of Golden Vase are constricted.</p>
<p>After a while, she suddenly stopped and put down her hand. Close your eyes and breathe deeply. After several ups and downs of her chest, her face returned to her usual appearance. In front of him, the green light on the hand of GUI Li disappeared slowly. As for his figure, he had already walked far away in the piercing laughter of the grey haired three eyed monkey.</p>
<p>The Golden Vase calmed down, but at the same time, he was still a little angry, but at the same time, he felt a little hot on his face. She has always been upside down to play with people&rsquo;s hearts. How could she know that she was teased by a monkey today</p>
<p>She hummed, put these things aside, was about to move forward, suddenly she frowned, as if thinking of something, turned around and slowly walked back. After a while, she had gone to the spot where Xiaohui had just spat out the nut.</p>
<p>The stone is a common wild fruit in the mountains here. There is nothing strange about it. But the nut at this time is totally trapped in the ground and only a few hard shells are exposed. But on this dark and strange peak, unlike the rest of 100000 mountains, there is soft soil and hard rock everywhere.</p>
<p>Small ash a spit of force, actually is to hit the stone into the hard stone.</p>
<p>Jinpinger frowns slowly, stands up slowly, and looks towards the direction where the ghostly figure disappears. The wind gusts from that direction, and it seems that there is still monkey&rsquo;s small gray piercing laugh in the wind.</p>
<p>In a low voice, as if she whispered to herself, &ldquo;how could this monkey have such a good way of doing things? How could this man be&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The vast black forest has ushered in new visitors. But this time, the number of guests is far more than before. As many as a dozen people, walking through the jungle, in the leafy giant trees and vines of thorns.</p>
<p>However, this part of the journey, in addition to the unexpected beast attack, went some unexpected smooth.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi frowned slightly and did not speak. However, Zeng Shushu couldn&rsquo;t help saying to Li Xun: &ldquo;senior brother Li, there seems to be something wrong here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li Xun stopped and took a look around him. Then he looked at Zeng Shushu and pondered for a moment. Then he turned to all the disciples of the burning incense Valley and said in a loud voice, &ldquo;everyone, please rest here for a while. Later, we will continue our journey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all agreed, obviously, it is not an easy thing for anyone to walk such a long way.</p>
<p>After settling down the others, Li Xun and Zeng Shushu went a little bit closer to Lu Xueqi. Lu Xueqi frowned, but she stepped back.</p>
<p>Li Xun&rsquo;s face sank, and Zeng Shu was so clever that he immediately interrupted him and said, &ldquo;elder martial brother Li, have you found out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li Xun nodded his head, and his eyes fell on the feet of the three men. Although it was fuzzy among the thick thorns, there was a faint impression that someone had trampled on the thorns after it was broken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone walked through this forest before us, and certainly not long ago.&rdquo; He was sure of his way, and at the same time, there was an irresistible sadness on his face.</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu pondered: &ldquo;could it be elder martial brother Li, your classmate&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li Xun shook his head and said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s impossible. Only our team goes deep into 100000 mountains. Most of the young elites in the valley are here. No one else will come in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu frowned and said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s strange. According to the master of cloud Valley on that day, this news should not have been disclosed! Is it that other sects also know the news. Into 100000 mountains? &quot;</p>
<p>Li Xun hesitated for a moment, then shook his head and said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it should be. First of all, it is still confidential. Only the two of us know, &ldquo;he said, coughing softly and lowering his voice.&rdquo; the beast God is the culprit of the catastrophe. If other people fall into the well and get killed. After taking advantage of it, we two factions fought bloody on the top of Qingyun Mountain. Isn&rsquo;t it&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu reached out and patted Li Xun on the shoulder with a smile on his face. He said with a smile: &ldquo;what senior brother Li said is just what I want. It&rsquo;s true that heroes think alike! Hehe, hehe, hehe&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>He here two people look at each other and smile, but suddenly a cold hum comes from Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s mouth. Both of them were stunned and looked at it in a twinkling of an eye.</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu asked in a low voice: &ldquo;sister Lu, what&rsquo;s wrong with you? Are we wrong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi gave him a cold look, turned her head, and said with a sneer: &ldquo;his face is disgusting!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu was in a daze, but for a moment he couldn&rsquo;t understand the meaning of Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s words. I don&rsquo;t know whether she scolded herself or Li Xun, or both. He turned to look at Li Xun, and they looked at each other. I feel embarrassed for a moment. I don&rsquo;t know what to say.</p>
<p>A moment later, after all, Zeng Shushu was more cheeky and made a ha ha. Pretending that he had never heard of anything, he said to Li Xun: &ldquo;elder martial brother Li, since the news has not been leaked out, and it is not other disciples of the burning incense Valley, there are such traces here. I&rsquo;m afraid there is something strange about it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li Xun frowned. Obviously, Lu Xueqi, who was just turning around in front of her, said coldly, &ldquo;the God of animals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both Zeng Shushu and Li Xun were shocked, and their faces showed astonishment.</p>
<p>After a while, Zeng Shushu nodded slowly. Although he was hesitant, he still said: &ldquo;this What elder martial sister Lu said is more It&rsquo;s fantastic, but if you think about it carefully, it&rsquo;s really possible! &quot;</p>
<p>Li Xun&rsquo;s face was not the same as Zeng Shushu. He hesitated for a moment, shook his head and said, &ldquo;forget it. Let&rsquo;s go on and have a look. It&rsquo;s useless to speculate here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said, he said to two people: &ldquo;you also have a rest, I go back to see those younger martial brothers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu nodded and said, &ldquo;brother Li, please go ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li Xun asked two more words to be careful and walked backward.</p>
<p>When Li Xun went far away, Zeng Shushu turned his head and suddenly said with a smile: &ldquo;elder martial sister Lu, were you scolding me just now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi snorted coldly, neither admitting nor denying it. Looking at the meaning, it is more tacit.</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu gave a bitter smile and pondered for a moment. He slowly walked to Lu Xueqi, but he lowered his voice and said, &ldquo;elder martial sister Lu, I have something to ask you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi took a look at him and was stunned for a moment. She saw that Zeng Shushu&rsquo;s face was very serious and serious at the moment, which was very different from usual. She said at the moment: &ldquo;what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu took a deep breath, looked around, and then said in a low voice: &ldquo;elder martial sister Lu, tell me honestly, is the ancient sword for killing immortals really damaged?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s face was white and her eyes were shining. She was staring at Zeng Shu Shu. Even the sky Ya sword in her hand, with its light blue light like autumn water, seemed to emit an invisible buzzing sound. She stretched out in an instant, and then slowly took it back.</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu&rsquo;s face changed slightly. He only felt that the woman in white looked like ice in front of her for a moment, but this moment seemed to become a sharp and terrible needle. He could not help but step back and said with a low voice and bitter smile, &ldquo;sister Lu, don&rsquo;t do this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi stared at him coldly and said, &ldquo;what do you mean by this sentence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a smile, Zeng Shushu said, &ldquo;how can I say that I am also a disciple of Qingyun? How can I not care about this kind of thing? Elder martial sister Wenmin, she went back to the mountain temporarily. I&rsquo;m afraid she just wanted to return this to all teachers? &quot;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi did not speak, just looked at him coldly.</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu nodded and said, &ldquo;OK, elder martial sister Lu, I&rsquo;m not malicious, but there are some things here that are suspicious. There are few opportunities on the way. It&rsquo;s just that I&rsquo;ll talk to you now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi looked at him and said, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu coughed and said in a low voice: &ldquo;what kind of person do you think the master of burning incense Valley, Yun Yilan, is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi frowned and said, &ldquo;what do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu said with a smile, &ldquo;well, do you think the cloud Valley master is a simple minded person? Or is it a person who is as evil as a foe, who takes the world&rsquo;s righteousness as his duty and has no defense against Qingyun&rsquo;s disciples who are also righteous? &quot;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi snorted. He didn&rsquo;t speak, but his face was disdainful. Obviously, he meant no to Zeng Shu.</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu is not angry. It seems that Lu Xueqi will have such a reaction. Then he said, &ldquo;since we all know that the cloud Valley master is not such a warm-hearted or simple minded person, isn&rsquo;t it strange that he rashly asked the three of us in the mountain and river hall that day about killing immortals and destroying them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi took a deep breath and looked at Zeng Shu without saying a word.</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu was embarrassed and said, &ldquo;OK! I know that&rsquo;s what I said behind my back, a respected elder.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something wrong with it, but you see, it&rsquo;s really strange when you think about it carefully&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with it.&rdquo; Lu Xueqi said in a cold voice. It seemed that she didn&rsquo;t care about Zeng Shu&rsquo;s slightly open mouth. She said coldly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what to worry about. From Qingyun Mountain to now, I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s a good man either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Er&hellip;&rdquo; Zeng Shushu was surprised and amused. He was speechless for a moment. He never dreamed of it. Lu Xueqi, who has always followed the rules and regulations, was even more out of line than herself. She just said that she despised a respected elder. However, looking back, it seems that there are quite a lot of festivals between this beautiful and beautiful woman, and the respected elder and his disciples!</p>
<p>Looking at Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s face, Zeng Shushu did not know how the back of his neck felt chilly. Intuitively, he thought, did he accidentally poke the hornet&rsquo;s nest? Then he coughed and quickly turned off the topic and said, &ldquo;this. Well, we don&rsquo;t care about his character, I mean. In this matter, the cloud Valley master has at least a few unusual places&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did he know about the destruction of Zhuxian ancient sword? This is one of them.&rdquo; Lu Xueqi cut off the words, on the face of the same expression, but in the eyes of a glimmer of light, such as dazzling crystal general. &ldquo;Second, why did he tell us when he knew it. He clearly knows that this news comes from his mouth, and we must give it back to all the teachers of Qingyun gate. Then, isn&rsquo;t there an immediate change between the burning incense Valley and the Qingyun gate? &quot;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu nodded repeatedly and said, &ldquo;I knew that with the wisdom of elder martial sister Lu, one can never fail to discover the crucial relationship among them.&rdquo; After a pause, he continued: &ldquo;if you think about it carefully, there are only two situations for the leader of the cloud valley. First, there is a spy in Qingyun gate who informs him. Even a disciple of Qingyun, such as me, has kept the secret. He even knows it. It shows that the identity and status of the spy can not be underestimated. But if he said so, would it not be possible for him to reveal the identity of the spy instead? &quot;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi snorted and said, &ldquo;second, what is the purpose of his telling us these words? Is it to remind the Qingyun gate that he already knows the secret, or to warn all teachers that the burning incense Valley is no longer afraid of Qingyun gate? &quot;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu took a deep look at Lu Xueqi, sighed, and said, &ldquo;what I think in my heart, you have already thought of it. In vain, I still want to remind you.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s right to think about it. You asked elder martial sister Wenmin to temporarily return to Qingyun on that day, so you should report these things to your elders! &quot;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi was silent and nodded.</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu&rsquo;s mouth moved, suddenly a long sigh, the voice is actually very emotional.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi slightly Zheng, way: &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu gave a bitter smile and said, &ldquo;I and I sigh for the ancient sword of killing immortals in our school. To be honest, although I think of it here these days, I still feel very reluctant to be true. I would rather guess wrong myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi did not speak, but quietly turned her head and looked ahead. Deep in the forest, there is no light in the future.</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu took a long breath, shook his head, and said, &ldquo;forget it, there is no way to think about it any more, so I have to take a look at it step by step. I&rsquo;d like to see what kind of medicine is sold in the gourd of the cloud Valley master? &quot;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi did not answer, her eyes inadvertently turned to the blurred trace just found.</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu said in a low voice: &ldquo;in fact, the animal God you said may be possible, but I always think it should not be him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi said, &ldquo;who do you think it is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu pondered for a moment and said in a low voice, &ldquo;if all that Li Xun said is true, and it&rsquo;s not the other disciples of the burning incense Valley, I&rsquo;m afraid that most of these traces are left by the remaining evils of the demon sect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi body a shock, turned around, always cold beautiful face on the first move, way: &ldquo;why do you say so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shu pointed to the trace and said, &ldquo;you see, although the trace is vague, it is obviously the trace left by human beings passing through here. Since the burning incense Valley has never been here, there are no other sects in the world who are more familiar with 100000 mountains than they are. It is hard to imagine that they will trace it here. However, the evil cult is different. After the war between the good and the evil, the evil cult was expelled from the Middle Earth by the right way. It seems that such poor places as these are, I&rsquo;m afraid they will also come. So it&rsquo;s them. I think it&rsquo;s possible. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you say! Sister Lu? &quot; Zeng Shushu turned his head and asked, but looking at Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s face, he was stunned involuntarily.</p>
<p>The beautiful woman stared at the footmark, looking slightly pale, but with a faint blush from her skin. In this desolate and cold old forest, she stood in seclusion, as if she had fallen into a strange dream, and could no longer hear the words of the people nearby. (to be continued.</p>
