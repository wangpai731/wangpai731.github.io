      <p>Storm, still did not stop the appearance.</p>
<p>In the dark, the little light swept, it is the magic weapon in the hands of Qingyun disciple, with the help of the magic weapon glimmer, searching in the wind and rain. This is close to the outside of Qingyun Mountain. It is densely forested with ancient trees and dense plants. In addition, the weather is extremely bad, and the sky is full of lightning and thunder. From time to time, there is a split lightning from the sky and falls in the forest. It is really breathtaking.</p>
<p>In front of the power of heaven and earth, Qingyun&rsquo;s disciples, who were a little less skilled, couldn&rsquo;t help being frightened and trembling. And in a dark, that little light, it seems like a trembling firefly general, flying, only light up a small place around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boom&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the black clouds in the sky, there was another thunderbolt. People on the ground felt the hum in their ears, and they could not help losing their color. It has been two hours since the search for GUI Li, but there is still no trace of it. Many people begin to wonder whether they have been run away by this demon?</p>
<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s reasonable to think of it. As the vice leader of the ghost King sect of the demon sect, GUI Li has a wonderful way of doing things. Although it seems that he was hurt by the ancient sword of Zhuxian two hours ago, who knows how much he hurt? As long as they are not seriously injured to the point of dying, they must have the ability to sneak away quietly!</p>
<p>This idea echoed in the minds of many Qingyun disciples, but the teacher urged him to scold him behind his back. He did not dare to give up and had to continue searching. However, in the dark not far ahead of them, GUI Li was seriously injured and was unable to escape. He was crawling in the mud with the last chance.</p>
<p>In the dim light of darkness, suddenly someone yelled: &ldquo;stop, everyone stop!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The voice of this man spread far away in the dark, and even the thunder in the sky could not suppress his voice. Obviously, he is a master of profound morality. GUI Li did not move to lie on the ground, let the rain hit on the body, heard this sound but felt a little familiar, but for a moment can not remember who this person is?</p>
<p>However, it was obvious that the disciples around him were extremely convinced and respected. Almost at the same time when he was shouting and drinking, all the Qingyun disciples who heard him stopped and stood in the same place, no longer talking. In the wind and rain, the original noisy search suddenly quickly quieted down.</p>
<p>Only in the woods, I don&rsquo;t know who&rsquo;s breathing.</p>
<p>The more urgent the wind and rain!</p>
<p>Someone seems to be listening to something.</p>
<p>GUI Li only felt a chill suddenly immersed between the heart and lung, the whole body was cold, there was a kind of creepy strange feeling. It seems that this strange silence is more frightening than that of the shouting search.</p>
<p>After a while, a voice whispered, &ldquo;father, what&rsquo;s the matter? Can you hear something?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was very familiar with the voice. It was his good friend Zeng Shushu. After a while, he knew who the elder in charge of this area was. It was Zeng Shuchang, the head of Fenghui peak, who was Zeng Shushu&rsquo;s father. Most of the Qingyun disciples searching for this area were fenghuifeng&rsquo;s disciples.</p>
<p>Uncle Zeng has been famous for a long time, and he is really not an ordinary person. In the noise of the wind and rain, he can still hear a little strange sound from the ghost. It is only in the dark jungle in front of him at the moment. I can&rsquo;t see my fingers. There is no news except the wind and rain. Even he himself could not help but wonder whether he had heard the very slight strange voice just now. Or is it that many people search together and cause some animal to run away.</p>
<p>After pondering for a moment, Zeng Shuchang frowned in the dark, waved his hand, and said, &ldquo;all the disciples should be separated and arranged in a line. They should not be more than three feet apart. They should search forward slowly and not leave any gaps. &quot;</p>
<p>When he was frightened, he only heard Zeng Shushu&rsquo;s voice with slight anxiety and said, &ldquo;father, this forest is so big, and you send all your disciples to search so intensively here, then you can&rsquo;t find it anywhere else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have my own reason. You don&rsquo;t have to say much. Go quickly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu was stunned for a moment in the dark. He did not dare to speak any more. He had to turn around and move on. In the dark, there was no one to speak for a while, but there was a little bit of light. He walked slowly in the wind and rain, and gradually turned into a long snake and pushed forward slowly.</p>
<p>Somehow, the atmosphere in this forest suddenly became a little strange. When the noise was just now, everyone was excited, but no one was afraid. At the moment, the silence was so quiet, but I didn&rsquo;t know how to make people feel a little hairy.</p>
<p>Because of the Taoist magic weapons, the faint light of those magic weapons in Qingyun disciple&rsquo;s hands can&rsquo;t shine far, and the brightness is also quite limited. They are connected with each other, and slowly push forward. Soon, they are only two feet away from the ghostly and invisible place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly, Zeng Shuchang had a loud drink. Dozens of fenghuifeng disciples from Qingyun Mountain stopped at the same time. Zeng Shushu was surprised and went to his father. With the help of the magic weapon, Zeng Shuchang&rsquo;s face was filled with dignity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shuchang&rsquo;s eyes were deep, and he looked directly into the darkness ahead. However, what he thought was not a place of ghostly invisibility. On the contrary, he looked at the distant and deep forest of parallel front.</p>
<p>The deepest darkness, as if nothing, and as if filled with countless ghosts, howling and dancing in the wind and rain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something wrong&hellip;&rdquo; Under the dim light, the wrinkles on Uncle Zeng&rsquo;s face seemed to suddenly deepen, and there was some suspicion in his eyes. But after all, he was not a mortal. After years of practice, he was determined. After a cold hum, he had made a decision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zheng&rdquo;, a light roar, startled everyone. Zeng Shuchang actually sacrificed his sword. The sword was silvery white. It flickered in the dark wind and rain. It was bright and dazzling. It was quite different from the green cloud disciples around him.</p>
<p>But when he was silent for a moment, he said in a loud voice, &ldquo;I will go ahead, you will not change. You will still search in a line according to what you said just now, but you should follow me a foot behind me and keep away from me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the moment, people all know that things are strange and wrong, but with Zeng Shuchang there, they have a backbone in their hearts. At present, Zeng Shuchang&rsquo;s face is dignified, and he walks in front of the team with his sword. However, people around him are still the same as before, but he keeps a distance from him and dare not get close to him.</p>
<p>This strange team continued to move slowly.</p>
<p>Strange smell. As if in the thick forest of this stormy night, gently panting</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh Oh&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>Like wind and rain howling, like wild animals roaring, but suddenly startled. But found as if their own heartbeat.</p>
<p>That heart, actually seems to jump faster and faster!</p>
<p>Zeng Shuchang&rsquo;s old face reflected the faint light on the sword, which became more and more heavy. In the depth of the woods ahead, mysterious hostility came. Although he felt a little vague, it seemed that he could not be sure whether he was the enemy or not, but the wave of strange palpitations in his heart still made him unable to despise.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t had that kind of feeling for a long time. I still remember the scene when he and Tian Bu Yi, a senior brother of changmen wanjian, rushed into the wilderness with the first elder martial brother of wanjian in changmen and went straight to the demon sect&rsquo;s nest? Time is long. It turns out that it has been so long</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t know whether elder martial brother Wan, who died young, can be reincarnated now?</p>
<p>Such a strange idea suddenly came into his mind, and even he himself could not help being surprised and funny. He took a deep breath and refreshed himself. Somehow, today is really different from the past!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boom!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was another thunderbolt, which suddenly exploded. The power of heaven and earth shook the earth for a moment, as if the earth were under your feet. He also trembled a few times. Almost at the same time, a lightning burst through the sky, broke through the clouds and landed on the earth.</p>
<p>Like the sharp blade of heaven. Cut to the world!</p>
<p>All of them were astonished. All the disciples were so excited that some of them could not hold their own. Suddenly, one patron looked up at the sky and fell down. He was so angry that he almost scolded him. However, when he looked back, he was surprised to see that under the light of the sky, he was in front of a muddy body, motionless to the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&hellip;&rdquo; The voice was shrill and shrill, &ldquo;here, here&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; A muffled sound, the disciple&rsquo;s cry suddenly stopped, but it was this moment that had already startled all the people, and instantly turned around and rushed over.</p>
<p>A dark shadow rose from the ground, but before he could stand still, his body had already shaken a few times and was almost about to fall. In an instant, more than ten magic weapons have come with wind and rain.</p>
<p>He was cold in his heart, but he didn&rsquo;t want to wait for death. He gritted his teeth and ran forward. Unexpectedly, he took a few steps. He felt a sharp pain in his chest. He could not hold on and fell down.</p>
<p>But behind the crowd a burst of cheers, at first several Qingyun disciples have already caught up, stretched out their hands to the ghost.</p>
<p>At this time, all of a sudden, the darkness in the deep forest seemed to expand abruptly, like the silent roar of a strange beast, and there was a flash of light in the dark.</p>
<p>At the same time, he said in a sharp voice: &ldquo;all disciples, step down, hurry up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The disciples of Qingyun didn&rsquo;t react. They saw that Zeng Shuchang was alone and rushed into the darkness ahead. Originally, Zeng Shuchang had a brilliant sword in his hand, but when he trampled into the darkness, he could not see the light of his sword any more. He only heard the roar and howl.</p>
<p>At a time when the Qingyun disciples did not know what to do, a strange figure shot out of the darkness ahead, towards the place where the ghost fell to the ground. At the same time, Qingyun disciple flew here. With the help of that little glimmer, I saw the figure wrapped in black shadow all over the body, only a pair of eyes were exposed, and the essence was shining.</p>
<p>Qingyun disciples yelled at each other, drew out their swords and rushed up. Unexpectedly, this man had a very high moral character and did not see him reach out his magic weapon. However, he grabbed the nearest Qingyun disciple with empty hands.</p>
<p>Although the green cloud disciple was not confused, he cut off the magic weapon of the immortal sword with a sword in his hand. The man in Black said nothing, turned a blind eye, and kept his grip unchanged. In front of the public, he grabbed the immortal sword in his hand. They were shocked, but before they could react, the man shook hard. The Qingyun disciple who was fighting with him had already flown out, and the immortal sword was snatched by this man.</p>
<p>He is a man of high moral character, but he is extremely strong. In the darkness ahead, uncle Zeng often drank furiously, but he seemed to be entangled and unable to separate himself to rescue him. On this strange night, it was incredible that many mysterious experts were lurking here.</p>
<p>Although they came to the enemy with high moral standards, all of them were from famous families. They were not ordinary disciples. They were shocked, but none of them ran away. Instead, they seized magic weapons and rushed forward.</p>
<p>The man in black seemed to be anxious and impatient. His hands were strengthened. The xianjiandun, which was snatched from him, was far more prosperous than that in the young disciple&rsquo;s hands just now. But the light flashed and the wind roared, and it was chopped down in the air, a huge halo. He went straight to the crowd. All the Qingyun disciples cried out one after another, and they all stepped back to meet the enemy. Unexpectedly, although the man was very powerful, he was only bluffing and forced back several steps with one move. Not to tangle with each other, he directly picked up his weakness and hung on the ground. I don&rsquo;t know if he had fainted and flew away in the dark.</p>
<p>Qingyun people were surprised and angry. They were surprised that the mysterious humanity in the horizontal direction was so high that they were robbed.</p>
<p>GUI Li is a big problem for Qingyun gate. Because of its long-standing relationship with Qingyun gate, all the members of Qingyun gate have long intended to get rid of this man. He was robbed on the way. How can he bear this tone. At the moment, they all catch up.</p>
<p>Just after the general, suddenly heard a whistling, bright light flash, from the dark shot, people&rsquo;s eyes, as if this sword is shooting at their own general, quickly stopped body to meet the enemy. Only when Zeng Shushu arrived, he flew up with a sword, but he felt his palm shake and he could not help but step back. But Lai Jian was also hit by him and changed its direction. It went straight up into the sky. In a moment, it fell down and sank into the mud with a thump. It was the stolen fairy sword that was buzzing.</p>
<p>But this delay, the man in black had already been like a ghost. He quickly fell into the darkness ahead, and Zeng Shuchang, who was fighting fiercely in the dark, suddenly roared. Someone snorted in the dark, and the blood light suddenly appeared.</p>
<p>They were shocked, but they didn&rsquo;t know whether Zeng Shuchang was injured or his opponent. The teacher&rsquo;s kindness was so great that they rushed forward in spite of so many. Only when they were halfway there, uncle Zeng&rsquo;s figure had already flashed out of the darkness and landed on the ground, stopping them. Judging from his figure, although the flash was unimpeded, his feet were a bit staggering and his mouth was breathing heavily. The fighting of this moment was a great consumption to him.</p>
<p>He gasped for a moment, then murmured, &ldquo;the way ahead is very high, and there are a lot of people. You can&rsquo;t make a mistake!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu and other young disciples were cold in their hearts. They never expected to meet such a situation in this place.</p>
<p>Looking at the darkness in front of him, Zeng Shuchang said in a deep voice: &ldquo;who are you? Why do you care about our Qingyun gate? If you are a Taoist, you must not be a nobody. Why don&rsquo;t you meet and talk? &quot;</p>
<p>Wind, rain, lightning, thunder, but I do not know how, the dark deep in the forest is so strong, such as the slightest ink.</p>
<p>No one answered Zeng Shuchang&rsquo;s question, only the sound of wind and rain and the panting voice of the disciples of Qingyun. Zeng Shushu stepped forward quietly and said in a low voice, &ldquo;father, what are their origins?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shuchang shook his head slightly and said in a low voice: &ldquo;they deliberately cover up their identities. What they are doing is not their own way of doing things, which can not be seen for a moment.</p>
<p>&quot;</p>
<p>Then he frowned, raised his voice and exclaimed, &ldquo;are you still here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The voice echoed far away in the dense forest, but no one answered after all. Suddenly, uncle Zeng changed his color and stamped his foot and said, &ldquo;no, it&rsquo;s a trick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he said this, he threw himself on the sword, and the sword was shining. This time, it was directly around, and there was no shadow over it. It was obvious that all those people had retreated. They came like the wind and robbed people immediately. It was obvious that they had a plan in advance.</p>
<p>Zeng Shuchang sighed and fell down. While directing other disciples to search around to see if they could find any clues, Zeng Shuchang asked in a low voice, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter, father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shuchang&rsquo;s face was a little disappointed, and then he sighed: &ldquo;although the fight was in a hurry just now, I have a faint feeling that these people are not using the magic sect&rsquo;s Taoist method. Besides, if people in the demon sect save the ghosts, they don&rsquo;t have to hide and hide. However, what kind of person should save this evil spirit! And there are a lot of people, so high is Taoism? &quot;</p>
<p>Then he frowned and thought deeply. Zeng Shushu was speechless. Looking back, he saw a dense forest and a dark future. Where could he see anything?</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t know, who are those people who robbed them? But no matter what, Zeng Shushu walked forward and said to himself quietly that it was better than falling into the hands of Qingyun gate</p>
<p>He thought like this, in this stormy night, deep in the forest, his mind seems to recall ten years ago, in the Qingyun Mountain Tongtian peak first saw the appearance of the ghost.</p>
<p>For a long time, he sighed in the dark and went on. No matter what the future may be, we must continue to move forward now.</p>
<p>At the other end of the unknown forest, deep in the dark, there is another strange black figure, overlooking the group of people from afar. It is Mr. ghost.</p>
<p>At the moment, his eyes seemed to be in doubt, and he looked very confused. After deep thinking, he could not understand it. After a long time, he saw that the search scope of these Qingyun disciples became wider and wider. However, the discerning eye knew that this was the precursor of giving up. In such a search, how could he find people in such a dense forest?</p>
<p>Sure enough, but after a while, Zeng Shuchang&rsquo;s voice had already sounded again: &ldquo;just, you all come back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The disciples of Qingyun were obviously eager to hear this, so they all went back. Mr. ghost watched uncle Zeng count people in the field from a distance, then turned around and led the disciples to the direction of Qingyun Mountain, and gradually disappeared into the dense forest.</p>
<p>He slowly emerged from the dark place and walked out, but his eyes drifted far away, looking at the direction of the group of mysterious people in black, and deeply staring.</p>
<p>In the wind and rain, a voice whispered, &ldquo;is there anyone else interested in him&hellip;&rdquo; (to be continued. )</p>
