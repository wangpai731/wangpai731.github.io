      <p>Li Qinghou was close at the moment. Standing in the array, his look was gloomy and incomparable. The whole person was like a knife out of the body, full of evil spirit.</p>
<p>Ouyang Jie took a look at Li Qinghou, and his eyes narrowed slightly. In the whole south bank and the palm seat of Sanshan mountain, what he cared most about was this Li Qinghou. At the same time, the other party was also the one cared about by the whole Lingxi clan.</p>
<p>In addition to his status as a pharmacist, Li Qinghou&rsquo;s natural talent is extremely rare. Now he has only been practicing Taoism for a hundred years, which is already the late stage of foundation construction, and even known as the inner clan. He is most likely to break through Zhuji and step into the golden elixir.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is said that one of the four disciples has something to do with Li Qinghou&hellip;&rdquo; When Ouyang Jie was thinking, the formation roared around him. Countless lights were shining. In the blink of an eye, there was a loud noise. Together with him and Li Qinghou, there were more than 2000 people in this place. In an instant, their figures were blurred and disappeared in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>At that time, it took several months for Bai Xiaochun to get to the place. Now, under the transmission of Lingxi sect&rsquo;s array, only a few breathing time came in an instant.</p>
<p>The sound of roar is like thunder rolling over the comatose Du Lingfei. The whole sky is dark at once. Countless clouds are torn apart by a pair of invisible hands. When the sound is loud, a huge array shadow appears in an instant.</p>
<p>It slammed down towards the earth and directly imprinted on the ground, which made the ground tremble within a hundred miles, like a flame, and gullies appeared. In a flash, a huge array mark was imprinted.</p>
<p>In this hundred Li, all the vegetation, all the rocks, including a mountain peak, all disappeared in this moment. The power of this array is too overbearing and destroys everything when it comes.</p>
<p>Du Lingfei&rsquo;s surroundings were protected at the moment when the array came, so that she was not hurt at all. At the moment, as the array fell, the earth trembled, and the figures quickly became clear from the blur.</p>
<p>Soon, more than 2000 Nanan Neimen disciples all appeared. They still had the power of transmission. They could still transmit once. Ouyang Jie and Li Qinghou quickly walked out and went straight to Du Lingfei, who was unconscious. Several female disciples of the inner gate had come forward to feed Du Lingfei with pills and clothes to nourish her aura. Du Lingfei slowly opened her eyes and was in a trance at first After seeing all the people in zongmen, she cried. The excitement filled her whole body directly.</p>
<p>In particular, as a disciple of Xiangyun mountain, when she saw Li Qinghou, the leader of Xiangyun mountain, she shed more tears and spoke anxiously with the help of her peers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Palm seat, save younger martial brother Bai&hellip;&rdquo; Du Lingfei&rsquo;s face was pale, and her voice was beseeching.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with Bai Xiaochun?&rdquo; Li Qing waited for a step, and suddenly appeared in front of Du Lingfei. Her eyes were filled with anger and anxiety, and she opened her mouth in an urgent voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Younger martial brother Bai In order to save me and Hou Yunfei, senior brother Hou flew out alone and led the pursuers of the Luochen family away&hellip; &quot; Dufei, all the way to cry.</p>
<p>Almost all of them didn&rsquo;t know Bai Xiaochun. But gradually, listening to Du Lingfei&rsquo;s words, they all looked moved. The process was so tragic that each of them took a breath.</p>
<p>Feng Yan died in order to protect his family. Hou Yunfei and Du Lingfei fought hard to escape. However, the Luochen family sent two groups of people, including eight layers of condensate gas and nine layers of condensate</p>
<p>This kind of pursuit, for other inner disciples, is afraid to die alone.</p>
<p>In particular, Bai Xiaochun in Du Lingfei&rsquo;s words is a person who is sentimental and righteous and even arrogant.</p>
<p>He could have run away alone, but he came back to save his family. He crossed the steps and killed several strong enemies. He ran all the way with two seriously injured classmates. He escaped for most of the month and walked nearly ten thousand miles.</p>
<p>Finally, he sacrificed his life for righteousness, lured away the strong enemy and left hope for his classmates to survive. This was the message of Du Lingfei. Otherwise, he might not have known about the rebellion of the Luochen family at the moment.</p>
<p>Slowly, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s figure has become very clear in the hearts of all the inner disciples here. He is a man full of love, tall and incomparable, just like a hero.</p>
<p>Even the people in the law enforcement hall were shocked. Qian Dajin was also among them. He stayed for a while. He couldn&rsquo;t overlap Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s image with the man Du Lingfei said. He acted impulsively and secretly on the first day of junior high school. Later, he was also worried about the investigation. The bottom of his heart was not completely sure that Bai Xiaochun was a little tortoise, but he was narrow-minded and jealous, He thought that he would rather kill wrong than let go. At the moment, he was relieved. Once Feng Yan died, he would not know.</p>
<p>Ouyang Jie, known as a jackal and merciless Taoist, also took a deep breath at this moment, showing respect in his eyes. With his accomplishments, he naturally saw that Du Lingfei had not lied, and even what she said might be less than half of the real situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such a disciple, my lingxizong will never allow him to fall here!&rdquo; Ouyang Jie&rsquo;s big sleeve swung and immediately arranged for hundreds of inner disciples to search for Hou Yunfei and Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>Li Qinghou was silent and raised his head slowly. A trace of blood appeared in his eyes. His heart was full of bitterness. Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s practice made him feel that he had not mistaken the child. But he understood that in such an environment, Bai Xiaochun could survive very little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I brought you up the mountain&hellip;&rdquo; Li Qinghou&rsquo;s whole body was full of evil spirit. His body stepped forward with a flash of light. With the help of the transmission power of Lingxi Zong remnant, his figure was blurred for a moment, and he went straight to the Luo Chen family.</p>
<p>Ouyang Jie sighed. After listening to Du Lingfei&rsquo;s words, he also understood that Bai Xiaochun was very dangerous. At the moment, his body was shaking and he was carrying the remaining two thousand people. All of them were transported.</p>
<p>Li Qinghou and Ouyang Jie, with two thousand inner disciples, appeared in the Luoxing mountains and in the mid air of the Luochen family house.</p>
<p>This time, the clouds in the air suddenly broke up and turned into an impact, sweeping around. The force of heaven and earth suddenly broke out. At the same time, countless exclamations were heard from the house, and the shadow of the array suddenly came down and went straight to the Chen family.</p>
<p>Boom! Boom!</p>
<p>The array fell and branded the earth. All the bluestone ground around the Chen family collapsed at this moment and became fly ash. The house also rocked and collapsed.</p>
<p>A roar came out from the house, and the figures flew out rapidly, with anger and despair, and made a sad and harsh sound.</p>
<p>The two stone lions in front of the door, as well as the fruit trees in the house, immediately turned into puppets and killed them all around. Li Qinghou was the first one to walk out. With a big sleeve, the two stone lions suddenly collapsed. The fruit trees trembled and all the fruits on them fell down. When they ran around, they were killed immediately.</p>
<p>This place was completely surrounded by Lingxi sect disciples and exterminated.</p>
<p>Li Qinghou&rsquo;s body flew directly into the ruins of the Luochen family&rsquo;s house. With a finger pinched by his right hand, a blue fire appeared and waved around. When his hair was flying, a force of earth shaking force broke out.</p>
<p>All around the fire spread in an instant, impacting the ruins, so that the house of the Luochen family was immediately rolled up, and those who rushed to the village all gave out shrill screams one by one, burning their bodies and disappearing in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>Li Qinghou raised his right foot and trampled hard toward the ground. The ground under his feet was directly broken. A huge crack, such as being torn open by life, revealed the underground palace below.</p>
<p>At the moment of the appearance of the underground palace, a blood lake suddenly rolled out, and the ancestor of the Chen family flew out.</p>
<p>When he saw Li Qinghou, he looked desperate. Suddenly, Lingxi Zong came, and his array was about to be completed. If it was someone else, he might be able to go around with his preparation, but it was Li Qinghou and Ouyang Jie!</p>
<p>His body retreated rapidly, and his mouth uttered a sad and shrill voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Escape, escape as many as you can!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the underground palace, all the people of the Luochen family trembled and galloped around, but all the eight sides were surrounded. All the inner disciples rushed to kill them at once with the motionless wave of Ouyang Jie.</p>
<p>Li Qinghou&rsquo;s eyes congealed and looked at the water of the blood Lake outside Laozu Chen&rsquo;s body. His face was moving. Not only was he here, but also Ouyang Jie was angry when he saw the blood lake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you want to kill the common people, it&rsquo;s hard for the people to die!&rdquo; Li Qing waits for a big sleeve to shake, all around the fire suddenly erupted.</p>
<p>At the same time, the sound of desolation was constantly heard. The inner disciples of Lingxi sect came to suppress them. This was not killing, it was crushing!</p>
<p>Two thousand, kill hundreds.</p>
<p>Seeing the death of the clansmen one by one, no matter their own children and grandchildren or other kindred people, all died miserably under the extinction of Lingxi clan. Laozu Chen raised the sky and howled and retreated faster.</p>
<p>But at the moment when he retreated, the roar came out, and a sea of fire rolled from all directions. With such speed and momentum, he directly shrouded Laozu Luochen. Li Qinghou&rsquo;s face was bleak, and his right hand was raised and pinched hard.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Laozu Luochen uttered a shrill scream. His whole body was condensed by the fire, and his flesh and blood were blurred in an instant. In the blink of an eye, the whole person became fly ash, and Li Qinghou One kill!</p>
<p>In this scene, all the inner disciples around him took a breath. Even Ouyang Jie opened his eyes fiercely. When he looked at Li Qing, he was shocked.</p>
<p>Li Qinghou stood in the air for a long time. With a wave of his hand, the sea of fire broke out again around him, enveloping the Luochen family. After burning everything here, he looked at the distance, with a faint look and a sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bai Xiaochun, I&rsquo;m Li Qinghou I&rsquo;m sorry for your white family. &quot; He walked to the distance in bitterness. He didn&rsquo;t trust others to find Bai Xiaochun. However, he had to search for Bai Xiaochun himself whenever there was a glimmer of hope.</p>
<p>With Li Qinghou&rsquo;s departure, the sea of fire is raging behind him. The inner disciples around him are gradually excited by the fire. The stronger the clan is, the more brilliant their future will be.</p>
