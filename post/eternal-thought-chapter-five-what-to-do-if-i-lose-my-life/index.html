<p>As soon as the wooden sword fell into the pot, there was no special change. Bai Xiaochun uttered a light cry and opened her eyes unwillingly, staring at the wooden sword carefully.</p>
<p>But after waiting for a long time, nothing strange happened. Bai Xiaochun thought a little, looked at the lines on the turtle pot, and looked at the wood ashes in the stove. Thinking deeply, she turned out of the room. When she came back a moment later, she had several more pieces of wood that were the same as those in the previous stove.</p>
<p>This wood is not very common in the fire stove. He asked Zhang dafong for some.</p>
<p>Lighting the wood, Bai Xiaochun immediately saw the first line on the turtle shaped pot and brightened up again. However, the wood fire burned rapidly and gradually went out. When Bai Xiaochun moved his mind, the wooden sword in the pot suddenly flashed with silver.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun stepped back a few steps, and soon the light dissipated. He immediately felt a sharp sense coming from the pot.</p>
<p>He took a deep breath and approached carefully. He saw the wooden sword in the pot. There was a sharp silver grain like LingMi. This pattern was slowly fading away and finally became dark silver!</p>
<p>The whole body of the sword is slightly different from the previous one. Although it is still wood, it gives people a sense of metal sharpness. Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s eyes brighten. He carefully takes out the wooden sword, which makes him feel heavier. When he gets close, he even feels cold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s a successful alchemy of the wooden sword.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun was overjoyed, holding a wooden sword. He looked at the pot again and thought about how to deal with it. Finally, he decided to put it here. The more so, the more nobody cared.</p>
<p>As for LingMi, eating is, and the wooden sword is easily invisible. Bai Xiaochun thinks that covering it with some dyes may weaken the light of the holy grain.</p>
<p>Thinking of this, he sorted it out, walked out of the house and pretended to be nobody. Until a few days later, he painted some juice from the kitchen room collected during this period of time on the wooden sword, making it look colorful and ragged. Then he manipulated it again and found that the holy stripe was indeed covered a lot, and it was no longer so obvious that he was satisfied with it Head.</p>
<p>In the next few days, Bai Xiaochun, like a fish in water, mingled with several elder martial brothers. He became familiar with the work of the fire kitchen. In particular, different kinds of spiritual food needed different kinds of fire, and even divided into one color fire and two color fire. He also understood that the wood under the turtle pattern pot was the spiritual wood that produced the same color of fire.</p>
<p>In particular, Zhang Da Pang liked Bai Xiaochun very much and took more care of him. After a few months, he did, as Zhang daphou once said, let Bai Xiaochun grow fat here.</p>
<p>Now he is no longer as thin as he was when he entered the sect. He has gained weight several times, but he is more white and clean. He looks more and more harmless to human beings and animals. He seems to be approaching the name of Bai jiupang.</p>
<p>As for the addition of food, he has experienced several times. However, what bothers Bai Xiaochun is that his weight has increased, but his practice is always slow. Later, he simply doesn&rsquo;t think about it. He has been eating, drinking and drinking with several senior brothers all day. He has heard a lot about many things in the clan from Zhang daphou and has a certain understanding of Lingxi sect.</p>
<p>It is known that there are inner and outer disciples in the sect. If the factotum can cultivate to the third level of condensate gas, he can go to the test road of each peak. If he can succeed, he can worship the tested peak and become the outer disciple of this peak. Only when he becomes the outer disciple can he be regarded as stepping into the threshold of Lingxi sect.</p>
<p>However, it&rsquo;s like a fish leaping over the dragon&rsquo;s gate. The trial road of each peak is opened every month, and only the first three are selected. Therefore, the number of disciples who become outside the gate all year round is fixed.</p>
<p>On this day, it was supposed to be Qi Pang going down the mountain to do some shopping, but it was delayed because of the matter. Zhang Dabao waved and asked Bai Xiaochun to go down the mountain. Bai Xiaochun hesitated for a moment, thinking that Xu Baocai would not come back for several months. He felt that there should be nothing wrong. He went back to his room and took out seven or eight kitchen knives and put on five or six leather clothes. The whole person was almost a ball.</p>
<p>But I still feel unsafe, so I find a strong pot and carry it on my back. Then I feel safe. I stagger out of the stove and go down the mountain.</p>
<p>Walking on the blue stone road of zongmen, Bai Xiaochun looks at the magnificent courtyard loft around. A deep sense of superiority rises leisurely in his heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My life is like a dream. Bai Xiaochun has been practicing for several months in my life. When I look back on the earthly world, I think of the village back then. It&rsquo;s full of sorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said to himself with emotion. He carried his hands on his back, with seven or eight kitchen knives hanging on his waist, a black pot on his back, and a layer of fur coats on his body, like a ragged ball. On the way, he met a lot of laborers. After seeing him, he looked sideways.</p>
<p>In particular, several female disciples, especially after seeing Bai Xiaochun, were amused by his appearance and chuckled. The laughter was as good as silver bell.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s round face was slightly red, and he felt that he was more powerful. He coughed and walked forward.</p>
<p>After a while, he did not wait to walk out of the miscellaneous service area of the third peak. Suddenly, he saw many laborers in the distance. All of them looked excited and ran quickly in one direction. There was the mountain road of the third peak, which was the place where the disciples of other schools often went.</p>
<p>Gradually, more and more servants ran with excitement. This scene made Bai Xiaochun stunned and quickly selected the weakest teenager from the crowd passing by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, younger martial brother? Why do you run there? &quot; Bai Xiaochun asked curiously.</p>
<p>The young man was caught in his body, showing his displeasure. After seeing the big black pot behind Bai Xiaochun, his eyes immediately showed envy and his look slowed down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It turns out to be the elder martial brother of huozaofang. You can go and have a look. It is said that Tianjiao Zhouhong and Zhang Yide, one of the outer disciples, are fighting in the test field at the foot of the mountain. They have some personal resentment. It is said that they are all condensing gas on the sixth floor. You should go and have a look at the scenery. Maybe you can get some insight and gain something.&rdquo; After the young man explained, he was afraid that he would be late and there was no place. He ran forward quickly.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun was very curious and ran over. He followed the stream of people. Soon, he left the mixed service area. At the foot of the third peak, he saw a huge high platform there.</p>
<p>This high platform is thousands of feet in size. At the moment, there are countless laborers all around. Even there are many figures on the mountain. Their clothes are obviously gorgeous. They are all disciples of other schools and are also watching.</p>
<p>As for the high platform, there are two young people in the same luxurious robes. One has scars on his face, the other is as white as jade. They are interlacing with each other, and there are bursts of roar.</p>
<p>Both of them were shining brilliantly outside their bodies. In front of the Scarface youth, there was a small flag in front of the Scarface youth. If an invisible hand grasped and waved it, they formed a fog tiger. The roar was deafening.</p>
<p>And the young man, white as jade, was shuttling around, a blue sword, making bursts of soul marks, whistling away very flexibly.</p>
<p>Seeing this scene, Bai Xiaochun opened his eyes and took a deep breath. He could also control the wooden sword, but it was difficult to compare with the young man with white face.</p>
<p>In particular, the two men did not seem to have too much reservation, murderous, and even quite dangerous several times, so that there were many wounds on their bodies. Although there was no vital point, they were also shocking.</p>
<p>This is the first time that Bai Xiaochun saw the friars&rsquo; fighting method, which was quite different from the immortal in his impression. The ferocity and ferocity of that kind made him tremble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cultivating immortals It&rsquo;s just for the sake of longevity. Why fight and kill? What if I lose my life&hellip; &quot; Bai Xiaochun swallows a mouthful of saliva. When he sees the fog tiger with Scarface youth flag transformed into a ferocious one, she wipes the sweat on her head. She thinks it&rsquo;s too dangerous outside, so it&rsquo;s safer to go back to the kitchen.</p>
<p>Thinking of this, he quickly retreated, but at the same time, a roar came from far away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bai Xiaochun</p>
<p>As soon as Bai Xiaochun turned back, he saw Xu Baocai, who had written the blood book, rushing towards him with a grim smile. A wooden sword in front of him was shining with unusual light, which was obviously not comparable to that of condensing gas. At the moment, he drew an arc and gave out not weak spiritual pressure, and went straight to Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>When Bai Xiaochun saw the coming of the wooden sword, his pupils shrank, and immediately there was a strong crisis of life and death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is to kill me Realizing this, he let out a shrill scream and ran away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Killed, killed&hellip;&rdquo; The sound was so loud that many servants around him heard it. They looked at each other in surprise. Even Zhou Hong and Zhang Yide, who were fighting on the high platform, all stopped for a moment, which showed the great sound wave.</p>
<p>Even Xu Baocai was startled. He just called the other party&rsquo;s name and chased after him. The sword had not touched him, but Bai Xiaochun screamed, as if he had made several holes in his body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bai Xiaochun has the ability, don&rsquo;t run away!&rdquo; Xu Baocai&rsquo;s face was livid, and his teeth were itching. He ran straight for Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I had the ability, I would have killed you. I&rsquo;d fart. I&rsquo;d killed, killed!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun screams in the speed is extremely fast, like a fat rabbit, the twinkling of an eye can not see the shadow.</p>
<p>At the same time, at the top of the mountain, there is a hanging pavilion, in which a middle-aged monk and an old monk are sitting opposite each other, playing chess. The middle-aged man is Li Qinghou. The old man opposite him is full of white hair and has a ruddy complexion. His eyes are full of light. He looks extraordinary. At the bottom of the mountain, he smiles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Qinghou, the little baby you brought back is interesting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let the headmaster laugh, this son&rsquo;s character needs to be tempered a little more.&rdquo; Li Qinghou had a headache and shook his head after he dropped the pieces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The children in the fire kitchen are arrogant. It&rsquo;s not easy to get along with them.&rdquo; The old man touched his beard, and his eyes were full of teasing.</p>
