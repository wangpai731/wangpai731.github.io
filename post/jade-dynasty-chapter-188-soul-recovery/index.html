      <p>After a rest, the people who were lucky to escape were silent or left a few words of comfort, and then all left the bloody and horrible place one by one. In this troubled world, whose life is not life, who can control whose life? Every day and night, in every strange and secluded place, is not the same scene staged?</p>
<p>On Monday, the fairy and the little ring also left there. The beast demon&rsquo;s nest stinks and is disgusting. It&rsquo;s not a place for people to stay. They reluctantly removed the body of the wild dog Taoist from the beast demon nest and put it on the open space just entering the mountain forest.</p>
<p>The body of Taoist wild dog seems to be slightly warm, but, after all, it is so slowly cool down.</p>
<p>Zhou Yixian frowned and sat aside, shaking his head and sighing. Xiaohuan knelt beside the wild dog Taoist, sobbing.</p>
<p>The night wind is rustling and shaking the treetops. In the shadow, the mysterious man in black saw the scene just now in his eyes. Although it was easy for him to get rid of the two monsters, he stood in the dark from the beginning to the end as if the blood was cold. At the moment, his eyes from the small ring looked at, and then transferred to the body of Monday fairy.</p>
<p>After a long time, we only heard Monday fairy whispered: &ldquo;well, Xiaohuan, he is dead after all. Let&rsquo;s find a place to bury him and let him be buried in the earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Small ring body shakes for a while, choking voice is bigger, suddenly looks up to Monday immortal cry way: &ldquo;grandfather, you don&rsquo;t know everything, how about you think of a way to save him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The immortal on Monday gave a bitter smile and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a nine hell hell hell, and I&rsquo;m not an immortal in heaven. How can I know the magic of reviving the dead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Huan choked: &ldquo;but Taoist priest, he died to save us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Monday fairy sighed, his eyes moved to the dog Taoist&rsquo;s face, nodded, and said: &ldquo;speaking of all, I have been wrong about him before. I didn&rsquo;t expect that a person like him would have true feelings. Well, it&rsquo;s too late to say anything. Xiao Huan, listen to my grandfather. Let&rsquo;s bury him properly. &quot;</p>
<p>Little ring is numb, only tears on his face keep falling down, drop by drop, wet dog Taoist palm.</p>
<p>In the shadow. The man in black had a twinkle in his eyes, but there was no trace of pain or pity. In his eyes, the human feelings in the world seemed to be all live dramas, and only he watched coldly.</p>
<p>Monday fairy gets up. Looking around, it&rsquo;s just the barren mountains. Where can we find something convenient.</p>
<p>Looking for a long time, he can only pull a wooden stick to come back, on the ground warped a few times, but only a little soil turned out, if you want to dig a hole to bury people, God knows when to dig.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t we even have a good burial?</p>
<p>On Monday, the immortal left the stick and sighed, and there was a trace of vicissitudes on his face. Sighing, he looked back. Suddenly frowned. Xiaohuan did not know when she had stopped crying. After wiping away the tears on her face, she also found a stick to clean up beside the wild dog Taoist, sweeping all the dead leaves and branches far away.</p>
<p>At first, Monday immortal thought that Xiaohuan expected that it would be difficult to dig a pit, so he wanted to sort out the ground around the wild dog Taoist. However, the more he looked at it, the more wrong it was. Xiao Huan swept a circle around the body of Taoist wild dog with a radius of about five feet. He abandoned the stick and walked back slowly, with a little less sadness on his face. But a little more resolute.</p>
<p>On Monday, Xian saw that Xiao Huan didn&rsquo;t seem to have the right face. He took a few steps forward and said, &ldquo;Xiaohuan, what do you do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan whispered, &ldquo;I want to save him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as I say this. Monday fairy was shocked, it was the man in black in the dark. His body was also shocked, and his eyes were immediately fixed on the small ring. &ldquo;What are you talking about?&rdquo; he said</p>
<p>Xiao Huan&rsquo;s voice was still low, but his words were very clear. He said, &ldquo;I want to save him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Monday fairy shook his head and said, &ldquo;yes. Xiaohuan, I understand what you mean. No, it&rsquo;s not this. I mean, what can you do to save him? &quot;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan put out his hand to straighten the body of Taoist wild dog, but his hands were put in a rather strange way. He raised his shoulders over his shoulders, one hand to the sky, the other hand clenched his fist. At the same time, he said in his mouth, &ldquo;Taoist priest, he died to save us. I and I can&rsquo;t do nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhou Yixian frowned more and more tightly. He looked at Xiao Huan and then put the two feet of the wild dog Taoist priest straight. When he put his right foot under his left foot, his face was even more ugly. Suddenly, he said in a loud voice, &ldquo;are you crazy, Xiaohuan, do you want to use&rdquo; soul recovery &quot;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan was silent for a moment and whispered: &ldquo;grandfather, I only know this thing. Maybe, maybe it can really save people&rsquo;s lives?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fart!&rdquo; For the first time, Monday fairy yelled at Xiao Huan in such a fierce voice, &ldquo;what are you talking about? Although the &ldquo;soul gathering technique&rdquo; has the ability to collect souls, it has always been a side-by-side skill. It&rsquo;s dangerous and unpredictable. It&rsquo;s also a taboo in the world of ghosts. Don&rsquo;t you want to live? What&rsquo;s more, this technique has always been used on living people. If the breath still exists, the soul will be there. If there is such a basic method, you can cast it. What do you do to a dead person? If his breath is cut off, his soul will surely disappear. Even if you have this strange skill, where will you go to find his soul? Are you going to go to the endless ghosts in Jiuyou hell to find it</p>
<p>In the dark, his eyes twinkled, as if he suddenly found something incredible.</p>
<p>Xiao Huan&rsquo;s eyes were red, and he cried: &ldquo;grandfather, he and he have just died. Maybe his soul is nearby, and there may be hope. If it&rsquo;s one and a half minutes later, it&rsquo;s really hopeless. &quot;</p>
<p>Zhou Yixian turned pale, strode to Xiaohuan, pulled her up, and said in a deep voice, &ldquo;Xiaohuan, I tell you, you don&rsquo;t want to be paranoid. I know what you are thinking. In those years, you took back the soul of your sister jinpinger who wanted to be dissipated by your own skill. But I tell you, that time was different from now. I repeat, this magic is for living people, and these ghost and strange skills greatly damage Yin and virtue. In those years, you only saved the Golden Vase once, and you have already lost your Yang life for a year. Now if you do this again, it&rsquo;s hard to say whether you can succeed in casting Dharma on this dead man. At least you have destroyed the foundation of Taoism. Yang Shou is afraid that it will last more than 20 years. Have you thought it out? &quot;</p>
<p>In the last few words, Monday fairy almost roared out, and Xiaohuan was stunned for a moment. She was in the mood for love and said that she was not afraid to die. That was nonsense. However, she was hard to deal with the Taoist priest lying on the ground. However, when she thought of the terrible consequences, she seemed to be out of breath.</p>
<p>The atmosphere in the field froze for a moment and then for a moment. Monday fairy slowed down his tone and said in a soft voice, &ldquo;Xiaohuan, your life is determined by heaven. No one can change it. I think God wants the wild dog. He died today.</p>
<p>We have buried him so well that we are right to take him up, OK</p>
<p>Xiao Huan&rsquo;s face changed, and from time to time there was a struggling expression, after a long time. Suddenly he looked up and said, &ldquo;grandfather, his destiny is not set by heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhou Yixian looked at Xiaohuan&rsquo;s face, sank in his heart, and said with a dry smile, &ldquo;what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Huan took a breath and said decidedly: &ldquo;Taoist priest&rsquo;s destiny is determined by himself. He is desperate to save us. This is the unfortunate death. If he turns and leaves, there is no place in the world where he can settle down. &quot; The girl&rsquo;s face was a little pale. Some sad, low voice, &ldquo;so, he died for us, without him, we would have died early, where can we talk about Yang Shou here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at Monday immortal, but somehow she looked away, &ldquo;grandfather. I want to save him. No matter how dangerous this technique is, it can&rsquo;t compare with the one he met just now to save us? &quot;</p>
<p>She was determined.</p>
<p>Monday immortal knew that her mind was determined and could not be changed, so she had to look up to the sky and sigh. And the man in the dark. At the moment, a pair of eyes are looking at the small ring body, shining, Yiyi Shenghui.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>In the woods, it was the middle of the night, full of Yin.</p>
<p>In the dim light, that strange technique. Slowly unfold.</p>
<p>The first drop of blood, from the small ring white arm cut open, slowly fell on the side of the wild dog Taoist. Then, the small ring around the wild dog Taoist, with his own blood, dripping down beside the wild dog Taoist. Watch her wrists slowly shake, the dripping blood on the ground, slowly forming a strange pattern.</p>
<p>In the dense forest, with the gradual formation of the blood red pattern, ghosts began to cry. Monday fairy stood on one side, eyes slightly twitching. The man in black, who watched this scene for a long time in the shadow, suddenly frowned at the moment.</p>
<p>It was as if he had seen it somewhere!</p>
<p>Great wizard</p>
<p>The man in black could not help but tremble a little!</p>
<p>The blood array that Xiaohuan has set up is obviously similar to that when the great wizard in Huqi mountain rescued Biyao on that day. However, after a week of Xiaohuan&rsquo;s detour, the formation took shape, and the man in black could already see that there was still some difference between Xiaohuan&rsquo;s array and that of the great wizard on that day. Besides, the size of the array is much smaller. Maybe it&rsquo;s all based on blood. Xiaohuan&rsquo;s own blood can&rsquo;t be compared with the great wizard of that day.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s also for this reason that the pattern of totem and the array made by Xiaohuan are much simpler than those made by the great wizard on that day, but Rao is so. After a circle, Xiaohuan is already crumbling and pale.</p>
<p>Monday fairy did not say a word, went up to hold the small ring. Xiaohuan is a little weak. He looks back and smiles at him, and then slowly sits down at the top of the array, three feet in front of the head of the wild dog Taoist.</p>
<p>In the secluded forest, a ghost roar rises out of thin air. In an instant, the whole forest roars continuously, and the Yin Qi spreads all over the world. The wind blows from all directions and shakes the surrounding trees. Behind the shadow of all the branches, it seems that there are countless cold eyes watching here.</p>
<p>Xiaohuan looks solemn, slowly closes his eyes, a pair of white hands in the chest, low mouth chanting the mysterious mantra, a moment later, the slender palm in the chest, slowly put down, put in the front of the blood pattern.</p>
<p>All the blood patterns around the body of the wild dog Taoist suddenly all lit up. It seemed that all the blood suddenly got life and began to flow in the pattern. At the same time, his face was pale and strange.</p>
<p>The Yin wind is getting stronger and stronger. The whole dense forest seems to be dark at this moment. Only the Dharma array starts to shine. Lively flow of blood, as if the most delicious delicacy, attracted countless ghosts.</p>
<p>On Monday, the immortal&rsquo;s face was more and more worried. He knew the danger of the soul collecting magic. Imagine how dangerous it would be for ordinary people to snatch souls from the hell. However, because of his practice, Xiaohuan was only practicing in this dense forest, and the influence was barely large. I think it would not disturb those ghost powerful Dharma protectors in the underworld. Otherwise, one of them would be caught in the eye by accident, which would be unthinkable.</p>
<p>But now, it seems that it&rsquo;s just this kind of array, and Xiaohuan can&rsquo;t bear the feeling, but seeing her face getting more and more black, her body also began to shake. You know this cast. Different from her treatment of jinpinger in those years, the soul of jinpinger has not dissipated, so it is easier to collect the residual soul. On that day, the great wizard treated Biyao in Huqi mountain. Although the array is much larger, in fact, it also relies on the residual soul of the Biyao absorbed by the exotic treasure &ldquo;Huanhuan bell&rdquo;. This is how the Jiuyou hell is exhausted and the residual soul is recovered. But it is because of this that the great wizard ran out of oil and his lamp was dry.</p>
<p>Secondly, he also disturbed the Dharma protector of the underworld, and was devoured by the ghost power of the underworld, and finally died.</p>
<p>This time, the little ring, with its superficial way, runs the most strange and difficult magic in the ghost Road, and lacks the most critical soul. Even if the difficulty is to find the soul of Taoist wild dog among all the wandering souls in this dense forest, it is very dangerous to imagine.</p>
<p>The two monsters did not know how many lives they had harmed here, and how many evil spirits hovered here and failed to die. And the small ring set up this situation. But it is clear that it is to take a soul into this body. How can we not make all the ghosts crazy for it?</p>
<p>For a while, the wind and the clouds changed color, and countless faint black gas rushed to the small ring, and the pain color on the small ring became more and more serious, and the face color was almost completely covered by the black gas.</p>
<p>Looking at this, I&rsquo;m afraid Xiaohuan can&rsquo;t hold on for long, but somehow, she still refuses to give up, so many ghosts and spirits are circling around her. Some ghosts cry and howl, or plead endlessly, or ferocious force, all kinds of forest. In this world of pain and despair, all the evil feelings seem to pierce into her mind, but Xiaohuan is still struggling to support, with her own residual spiritual power, in the endless sea of unjust souls.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m afraid there will be no chance for this failure!</p>
<p>Monday fairy was already sweating. But he did not dare to disturb Xiaohuan, so he had to walk around and sigh. The figure in the dark shadow, though surrounded by ghost, seemed not to care at all. On the contrary, those ghost spirits seemed to be afraid of him and were far away from him. At the moment, the man in black looked at Xiaohuan without blinking. He could not help nodding for him. For a long time, he heard a voice that only he could hear. He said in a low voice: &ldquo;how can it be that this young woman is so gifted in ghost road that she can still endure under such circumstances. If there is any guidance from a master of ghosts and Taoism, it will take time to get it. &quot;</p>
<p>In the sound of his words, he even showed some indescribable hesitation.</p>
<p>At this moment, a happy look suddenly appeared on the black face of the middle and small ring of the field. The right hand that was immersed in the blood pool array suddenly stretched out and grasped the empty air. Then he put it down and grasped the right hand of the wild dog Taoist priest. Then she stretched out her left hand out of the pool of blood. As soon as she grasped the void, all of a sudden, the ghosts and ghosts all over the sky roared together. It seemed that all of them were trapped in uncontrollable fury. The ghost gas was as dense as iron. In an instant, the black air enveloped her and surrounded the small ring.</p>
<p>Outside the array, the trees within three Zhangs withered, as if they could not bear the boundless ferocity.</p>
<p>Monday immortal was stunned and at a loss. She gasped and tried to put her left hand on the right hand of the wild dog Taoist priest several times. However, she was surrounded by endless black air. Ghosts roared and the wind was blowing. It seemed that there was a strong force that made her unable to press it. And the small ring face color is more and more ugly, the body trembles, the corner of the mouth gradually outflow blood silk to come out.</p>
<p>Seeing that the array was about to burn all the jade and stone, Monday immortal was in a great hurry and was about to rush to pull the little ring out of the array. Although I don&rsquo;t know the consequences, it&rsquo;s always good to stay away from those ghosts. Unexpectedly, he did not move, suddenly a dark figure in front of him. Monday fairy was shocked. At this time, the man in black seemed to be almost the same as the ghosts around him.</p>
<p>The man in black only heard his hoarse voice and said coldly, &ldquo;if you want your granddaughter to live, you just stand there and don&rsquo;t move.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, the black figure flashed, and the man in black had already appeared around Xiaohuan and the strange array. Not to mention it, he waved his arms in succession and pulled out the black things from his hands, breaking into the ground and inserting them around the array.</p>
<p>Those things looked dark, like iron or non iron, and it was not clear what they were. But once these things were inserted into the earth of the array, the blood in the array suddenly seemed to be affected by some external force, and the flow speed almost doubled in an instant, like boiling. A red light shines from the array and covers the little ring.</p>
<p>This layer of red light seems to be particularly useful for the ghosts and ghosts around. For a moment, the ghosts retreated one after another. Under the red light, Xiao Huan&rsquo;s face quickly returned to normal, and his left hand stretched out in the air was pressed down immediately and grabbed the left hand of Taoist priest wild dog.</p>
<p>Just at the moment when Xiaohuan held the wild dog&rsquo;s arm, he heard only a slight burst. A dark red light started from the hand of the wild dog Taoist, and extended downward like lightning. In a flash, the whole body of the Taoist priest was on. Then, the whole body of Taoist wild dog was on. After a while, it went dark again and returned to normal.</p>
<p>At that moment, Xiao Huan tried to open his eyes and stare in front of him. The head of the wild dog Taoist priest suddenly tilted for a moment, and he breathed slowly.</p>
<p>Small ring big joy, the spirit of a loose, but the eyes of a sudden black, people have fainted in the past. (to be continued. )</p>
