      <p>&ldquo;OK,&rdquo; he said with a faint smile. He turned around, and his tired face seemed to be deeper. He said, &ldquo;what are you doing here? Are you trying to kill me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost shook his head.</p>
<p>The animal God was stunned for a moment and then said with a smile: &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect that there would be someone who didn&rsquo;t want to kill me. If you don&rsquo;t want to kill people in the world, how can I kill them</p>
<p>The beast God also looked at him. Between the two men, the flame was burning quietly and reflected in their eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Should I want to kill you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silence for a long time, a long time</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe.&rdquo; On the face of ghost Li, suddenly appeared a very complex look, a little reminiscence, a little pain, and a bit of vague confusion. In the face of the world&rsquo;s most vicious devil, he seems to be able to completely open his mind, completely without the kind of indifference and isolation in front of others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten years ago, I was determined to do away with all my heart and soul for the sake of all living beings in the world. Even though I knew that I was weak, I could not step back. But now&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>The beast God looked at him and asked, &ldquo;but?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bewilderment on his face was even more serious, and he said slowly, &ldquo;I just suddenly feel that what does this world have to do with me? All my life, I just want to live a normal life. I don&rsquo;t want to learn Taoism or cultivate immortals. I don&rsquo;t even want to live forever. &quot;</p>
<p>The expression on the beast God&rsquo;s face suddenly changed. His eyes changed from a faint sneer to a solemn one. Even there was a bit of bewilderment similar to the ghostly, as if something had touched something deep in his heart.</p>
<p>He suddenly said, &ldquo;what do you want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a smile of indifference, he slowly raised his head and looked up at the sky, but there was only the deep darkness in the ancient cave, without a trace of light. He said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Sometimes I have thought that maybe I can go back to the days when I was on the Dazhu peak ten years ago? Or maybe I dream of going back to my childhood. When you don&rsquo;t know anything, it&rsquo;s just, &ldquo;he said with a low, bitter smile,&rdquo; right and wrong, gratitude and resentment.</p>
<p>How can I forget it? &quot;</p>
<p>The beast God was silent for a moment and said, &ldquo;do you regret it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li didn&rsquo;t answer immediately. After a while, he looked at the beast God again, looked at the eyes behind the flame, and shook his head.</p>
<p>The beast God sneered and said, &ldquo;you know, you&rsquo;ve had a rough life, you&rsquo;ve been sad for a long time, but I&rsquo;ll ask you this time. But you don&rsquo;t regret it. What do you say? &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been rough for half my life, but I can&rsquo;t help it. I want to live an ordinary life, but I am involved in the dispute between Buddhism and Taoism; I want to practice peace of mind, but I become a demon and evil way; I would like to be true to people, but unexpectedly, I will plant wrong feelings until I understand who I really am&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>His face, slowly showing a sad color, after a long time did not go on. Then he whispered, &ldquo;regret? How can I regret it? What&rsquo;s the use of my regret&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>The God of the beast looked at the man standing there silently. Ten years later, it seemed that he had not depicted many vicissitudes on his face. But the figure of him standing there seemed so tired. The beast God could not help but begin to imagine what kind of life it was ten years ago.</p>
<p>Between the two men, fell into silence, as if they unconsciously fell into the past memories.</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s life. How much of the past is worth remembering?</p>
<p>decade? a hundred years? Millennium</p>
<p>Or will it eventually pass away in time?</p>
<p>The beast God thought silently, the weariness on his face became more serious. His eyes moved slowly to the direction of the entrance of the ancient cave. Across the endless darkness, there was a figure standing alone there, right?</p>
<p>Such a life, but what kind of life?</p>
<p>He suddenly asked the ghost, &ldquo;what do you mean to live for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the purpose of living?&hellip;&rdquo; After a long silence, he raised his head and said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. It&rsquo;s just that I&rsquo;ve been living for other people all my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The beast God was stunned for a moment and said to himself, &ldquo;what about me if I live for others! Who am I living for? &quot;</p>
<p>GUI Li was slightly surprised. Obviously, he didn&rsquo;t expect the beast God to say such a thing. Then, he frowned again. Obviously, he recalled his own words. He felt a little surprised. How could he speak like this.</p>
<p>After calming down, he regained calm on his fierce face. It seemed that the weak flash in the moment had disappeared and never existed in him.</p>
<p>He looked at the beast God deeply and said, &ldquo;I am not here today to kill you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The beast God still seems to be absent-minded. He thinks about something, and says, &ldquo;Oh, why are you here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li pointed to the gluttonous food lying on the ground beside him and said, &ldquo;I came here for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The beast God frowned, and a little surprise flashed in his eyes. However, Taotie on the ground responded immediately. He immediately widened his eyes like a copper bell, opened his mouth, and roared toward the ghost. Then he stood up slowly and was murderous. Xiaohui, a three eyed monkey, seemed to be confused. He slowly left Taotie&rsquo;s side and ran back to Gui Li&rsquo;s feet. He looked up at GUI Li and seemed to be puzzled by his master&rsquo;s words. However, after a while, he still climbed on the shoulder of GUI Li, but his three eyes looked at Taotie from time to time.</p>
<p>The beast God snorted and said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s strange. You didn&rsquo;t come here to kill me, but for this glutton? What do you want it to do? &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that I want it, it&rsquo;s another person who wants it, and that person&rsquo;s words, as long as it&rsquo;s not too much, I&rsquo;ll help him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The beast God looked at him for a moment, and then he burst out laughing and said, &ldquo;you owe people, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a moment of silence, he said, &ldquo;I really owe you a lot. I can&rsquo;t pay it back in my whole life, but it has nothing to do with you.&rdquo; He raised his eyes, Su Rong, and slowly stepped forward.</p>
<p>Looking at his figure slowly approaching, the pupil of the beast God seemed to contract slightly.</p>
<p>The flames in the brazier were reflected on his fierce face, and the dancing light and shadow trembled in the junction of darkness and light. He calmly said, &ldquo;I have no intention of being against you, but it seems that this is inevitable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The beast God raised his head and gave a sneer, &ldquo;do you think you can surpass me in your way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li didn&rsquo;t speak.</p>
<p>And it didn&rsquo;t stop.</p>
<p>The low footstep reverberates in the open space, there is no wind. But somehow, the only flame in the huge stone chamber suddenly began to swing, and the light gradually became stronger.</p>
<p>The darkness is like the dark, silent and unfathomable. I don&rsquo;t know how many demons and spirits are staring at the people in the light in the darkness.</p>
<p>The ghost went to the beast God in the fire light.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, the flame suddenly rose and burst into a dazzling light. The volume of the whole flame was several times larger than that when it was still burning. In the flames.</p>
<p>There was a sound like a dragon chanting, which reverberated far away.</p>
<p>With the sound of the Dragon chant, the whole huge stone chamber space trembled. The sound of the Dragon chant reverberated from low to high, from the depths of the dark. The echo did not weaken. Instead, it rose higher and higher, with a few% shrill whistling. At the end of the day, it was as deafening as a tsunami.</p>
<p>He stopped, for the flame in front of him had risen from the brazier. In front of him, and that piece of blazing fire, faint, actually seems to have a pair of ferocious eyes looming, staring at him.</p>
<p>The figure of the beast God has disappeared behind the fire, but his calm voice is clearly heard from the flame, saying: &ldquo;this is an ancient Dharma array in southern Xinjiang, which is called&rdquo; eight fierce XuanHuo array &ldquo;. If you can break it without dying, what do you want to do. I&rsquo;ll follow you. &quot;</p>
<p>His words fell, almost at the same time, a roar burst out from the brightest part of the flame, and the flame trembled violently. All the land within five feet around it was scorched and cracked, so we can imagine the degree of heat near the fire pot.</p>
<p>The strong hot wind was blowing from the front, and his fierce clothes fluttered backward. However, his face did not seem to be affected by any influence. Even the monkey little ash, who was lying on his shoulder, looked at the blazing fire with three eyes. But not fearless and painful. However, their looks are serious, anyone knows, this is just the beginning.</p>
<p>As like as two peas, the first bloody red pattern of the killer appeared slowly in the flames. The hideous face and strange posture were exactly the same as those seen in the burning altar at the incense burning valley. Staring at the image, his face slowly showed a complex look.</p>
<p>One by one, they light up one by one, and the blood red light gradually forms a circle around the center of the flame.</p>
<p>When the last blood red light closes under the flame, suddenly, the whole red halo suddenly shines, and the red light soars. Even the flame seems to be suppressed. Then, a fierce and violent anger comes to this space. In the depth of the flame, the pair of eyes, if there is no, are also in an instant amplification.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roar!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a roar from the sky, the whole stone chamber shook together in an instant, and the blazing flame was like a demon dancing wildly and swinging wildly. In the depth of the fire, the fierce beast, dressed in a blaze, roared and looked down upon the world.</p>
<p>Red flame Warcraft!</p>
<p>The Warcraft who used to guard the eight fierce XuanHuo array passed down by the ancient sorcerer clan in the XuanHuo altar of the burning incense Valley reappeared, but when facing its fierce and impish spirits for the second time, he could not help but change his color slightly. Xiaohui bared his teeth and lay on his fierce shoulder, facing the Warcraft, he roared angrily.</p>
<p>The huge body of the red flame Warcraft is constantly emerging from the huge aura of the eight fierce XuanHuo array, first the huge head, then the shoulder and front foot, and slowly, the body and hind limbs also slowly appear. With its arrival, the temperature in the whole stone chamber is more than soaring, and the ghostly clothes even begin to appear Brown phenomenon.</p>
<p>Finally, the last part of the body burning with fire appeared. The red flame Warcraft was surrounded by the fire, standing in front of the ghost and small ash. The ghost was only half the height of the fierce beast&rsquo;s foot. And behind this beast, the strange aura composed of eight evil gods&rsquo; images is sometimes bright and sometimes flickering, following behind the red flame Warcraft.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a devil, grinning in front of you!</p>
<p>The fierce breath came from all directions, and the familiar feeling seemed to start to seep in the blood again. It was even vaguely remembered that the last time there was a fierce fight in the xuanhuotan of the burning incense valley.</p>
<p>The ghost didn&rsquo;t move, but he was staring at the magic beast in front of him.</p>
<p>The red flame Warcraft with open teeth and claws turned back slowly, and a blazing heat wave surged over. His eyes seemed to be burning. He saw the ghost and the three eyed monkey ash on his shoulder.</p>
<p>Red flame Warcraft&rsquo;s huge head stopped for a moment. A moment later, it suddenly issued a huge earth shaking roar!</p>
<p>The roar was full of anger, resentment and a strong desire for revenge!</p>
<p>The blazing flame burst out in an instant. From the red light almost turned to pure white, countless flames rose into the sky, forming a flaming ball of fire, constantly spinning rapidly, terrifying head. Huoran opened his huge mouth. In the roar, he bit off.</p>
<p>Before his head reached the ground, the surrounding ground had already been cracked. The endless flame fell into the world like the sun, and roared down, drowning the ghostly figure in an instant.</p>
<p>The flame, like the climax after a carnival of life, is in full bloom!</p>
<p>And behind the fire, in those tired eyes. But indifference and can not see half of life&rsquo;s joys and sorrows.</p>
<p>There was darkness and silence around. Lu Xueqi and others had been walking in this ancient cave for a long time. Although they were alert all the way, they did not encounter any attack trouble after walking for such a long time.</p>
<p>In the dark, the beautiful figure shrouded by the soft light blue brilliance, Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s cold face gazed at the past from the dark, as if it were more beautiful and indescribable, set off by the darkness. There seems to be a little bit more mysterious and cold.</p>
<p>As if, that legend in the dark quietly blooming black lilies, growth for thousands of years, bloom only a moment.</p>
<p>From time to time, he looked at and looked away. But Lu Xueqi seems to have no feelings about it. In her bright eyes, she just gazed at the front. Although there was endless darkness there, there seemed to be something in the dark that she wanted to see.</p>
<p>She went forward. Never look back.</p>
<p>The darkness retreated in front of her, and then slowly closed behind her. Such a soft figure was so conspicuous in the dark that it even concealed the light of those behind her. It seemed that she was walking alone.</p>
<p>Suddenly, she stopped.</p>
<p>The crowd immediately stopped behind him. Li Xun looked around warily and came up. He was about to ask. He was stunned for a moment. Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s face showed a complex look, which seemed to be extremely on guard.</p>
<p>At this time, the darkness that had been silent in front of me suddenly changed. A slight throb seemed to appear suddenly in the dark, and then slowly began to roll, grow bigger and stronger</p>
<p>In the dark, there seems to be something slowly condensing, like howling, like roaring, but everything is silent.</p>
<p>A moment later, here, here</p>
<p>From the unknown place in the distance, a strong vibration, accompanied by a low howling sound, rumbled from the far direction here, and then rapidly grew larger, as if there were an incomparable giant spirit beast in the depths of this cave, roaring up to the sky!</p>
<p>The originally silent darkness around, like being ignited, began to boil gradually. In the dark, I don&rsquo;t know how many whistling voices came from all directions, and everyone changed color for a moment.</p>
<p>Li Xun stepped back a few steps and said, &ldquo;surround yourself. Be careful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the people in the burning incense valley are experienced veterans. Although they are not confused, they lean against each other and look at the front with vigilance.</p>
<p>The surrounding stone walls began to tremble slowly. It seemed that some huge force began to radiate slowly, and even the ground under foot had a slight shaking trend. In the darkness ahead, the strange commotion was more intense, as if corresponding to something, whistling something.</p>
<p>Under the condition of the great change, which was almost like a landslide, Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s figure did not know why, but didn&rsquo;t step back, far away from those who were waiting for the battle. She stood alone in front of the dark, the light blue brilliant front, as if the dark ground facing her, to swallow her at any time.</p>
<p>Without warning, a heat wave surged out of the dark, like a huge wave rushing through the ancient cave. Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s clothes and hair suddenly floated at the same time, but her figure did not waver.</p>
<p>The feeling of the heat wave blowing on the face is vaguely crazy, and it is more difficult to imagine what kind of scene is at the moment in the deep cave, the source of power. Lu Xueqi did not speak, just in the fierce storm, staring at the front of the rampant and dancing darkness.</p>
<p>Hot wind is crazy!</p>
<p>She suddenly looked up.</p>
<p>The wind blows her face like frost, but in her eyes, it seems that there are more fiery eyes burning deep heart.</p>
<p>Deep in the dark, far away in the dark</p>
<p>She roared loudly, and her body was in the midst of the earth shaking and the hot wind surging up against the wind, trying to shoot into the dark.</p>
<p>Behind him, Li Xun, Zeng Shushu and others changed color in horror and did not understand their meaning. Li Xun gang was about to shout, but he saw the bright light blue figure, like a sharp arrow leaving the string. He did not hesitate at all, but disappeared in the dark in a twinkling of an eye.</p>
<p>He was silent and speechless for a long time.</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu walked slowly to Li Xun and patted him on the shoulder. Li Xun did not look back at him.</p>
<p>The heat wave gradually weakened, and the violent shaking around gradually stabilized. Everything was slowly restored to its original state. If it was not for the debris falling around, it was almost illusory. It was just a dream in the dark.</p>
<p>However, the beautiful figure that has disappeared clearly shows that there are dangers in this strange cave.</p>
<p>Li Xun was silent for a moment, calmed down for a moment. He was just about to speak. Suddenly, a young disciple of incense burning valley called out: &ldquo;someone, who is there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rest of the people were surprised and looked forward. It turned out that there was a person out of the darkness. She was slim and charming. She was a beautiful woman.</p>
<p>All of them were stunned. For a moment, they thought it was Lu Xueqi who had gone and returned.</p>
<p>Li Xun was almost overjoyed when he called out, but when the words came to his mouth, his smile turned stiff, and he gradually turned black. There was hatred in his eyes. At the same time, he also had a kind of incredible sneer and said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s you&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman seemed to be startled when she heard the voice. She looked up and her face changed again.</p>
<p>This woman is beautiful and charming, but she is just a Golden Vase. (to be continued. )</p>
