      <p>On the bamboo peak of Qingyun Mountain.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan sat in his room, stunned.</p>
<p>It was a sunny afternoon. Soft light came from the window of the room and sprinkled on the bluestone floor inside. Maybe it&rsquo;s because there&rsquo;s some lazy breath in the air. The rhubarb and ash in this room are also a little lazy at the moment.</p>
<p>Rhubarb lies at Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s feet, buries his head on his two front feet, his eyes are half closed, his ears are drooped down, his whole body is up and down, only his glossy tail swings from time to time.</p>
<p>The monkey Xiaohui, who is always active, leans on the rhubarb at the moment, taking the rhubarb&rsquo;s belly as a pillow and sleeping soundly with his eyes closed. Meanwhile, his body rises and falls slightly with the breath of the rhubarb&rsquo;s belly.</p>
<p>As like as two peas in the past, it seemed like everything was as usual.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s eyes were blankly looking at the unknown place. This was the third day when he returned to Qingyun Mountain.</p>
<p>Suddenly, as if feeling something, has been drowsy rhubarb suddenly raised his head, eyes open, even ears up.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan frowned, and then heard the slow footsteps outside the door. A moment later, the door opened with a squeak.</p>
<p>The sun sprinkled in. For a while, Zhang Xiaofan saw only a figure standing at the door, bathed in the sun.</p>
<p>After his eyes adjusted to the sunshine a little, his face suddenly turned white. Tian was not easy to be gloomy and stood at the door.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s three days. Tian is not easy to come to see him for the first time. Besides song Daren, the elder martial brother who delivers rice to him every day, the first person he sees, presumably others, are unable to come to visit because Tian is not easy to get strict orders.</p>
<p>At this time, rhubarb had already run past, wagging its tail, and it was not easy to rub around at the edge of the field. It was very happy. But the other animal, Xiaohui, didn&rsquo;t like it that much. On the contrary, he was disturbed by people&rsquo;s good dreams and was quite annoyed. &ldquo;Squeak&rdquo; twice, but he finally knew that Tian was not the person he could provoke. So I didn&rsquo;t dare to go up there.</p>
<p>After a few calls, Xiaohui staggers back to Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s bed, leans on the quilt and sleeps again.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not easy for Tian to lower himself and look at the rhubarb at his feet. He reached out and touched his head. Rhubarb barked twice in a low voice and rubbed his head against the palm of his hand.</p>
<p>Tian doesn&rsquo;t easily pat rhubarb on the head, stands up straight and looks to Zhang Xiaofan.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan did not dare to look at him. He whispered, &ldquo;master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian didn&rsquo;t look at him for a long time and didn&rsquo;t respond to him. As he approached, Zhang Xiaofan took a step back subconsciously.</p>
<p>But Tian is not easy but has no action. Only slowly sat down in the chair, Zhang Xiaofan heart some fear, but more is at a loss and at a loss. In fact, since he returned to the mountain, he had expected to face such a situation, even worse, to face the interrogation and reprimand of more people, and he had already had psychological preparation.</p>
<p>However, on this warm and quiet afternoon, when Tian, who had been worshiping God for years, could not sit in front of him in silence, he only lowered his head. There is a blank in my mind. I can&rsquo;t say a word.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how long it took to hear Tian not easy to slowly tunnel: &ldquo;old seven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s body shook, he replied almost like a conditioned reflex: &ldquo;yes. Master. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you have anything to say to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan slowly raised his head and looked at Tian hard to see. Tian hard to look at him expressively. He could not see what he was thinking.</p>
<p>After a long silence, Zhang Xiaofan slowly shook his head.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not easy for Tian to stare at the apprentice. The hand that shrinks in sleeve clenched fist slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just now,&rdquo; Tian said slowly, as if to hide his feelings: &ldquo;this morning, Qi Hao from longshoufeng came here to send a letter. Tomorrow morning, the leader daoxuan immortal will see you in the Yuqing Hall of tongtianfeng.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s body shakes for a while. This moment finally comes.</p>
<p>The cool mountain wind came in from the outside of the open door, as if it still brought the sound of bamboo waves in the distance, but no one in the room felt it.</p>
<p>Xiaohui seems to be sleeping again, and rhubarb is lying down again, ignoring them. Only Tian can&rsquo;t easily still watch this disciple.</p>
<p>Look at him deeply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These days, do your senior brothers neglect you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan shook his head and said, &ldquo;no, senior brothers are all right with me It&rsquo;s good for me. &quot;</p>
<p>The field is not easy not to speak, the room returned to silence.</p>
<p>For a long time, Tian uneasy suddenly took a breath, as if he had made up his mind. He shook his head and stood up, and walked towards the door without turning back or saying a word.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan looked at the familiar back, lost.</p>
<p>Just as Tian was about to walk out of the room, he suddenly stopped again, but still didn&rsquo;t look back. Zhang Xiaofan called out, &ldquo;master&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seven!&rdquo; Tian&rsquo;s voice is still steady, but behind it, there is a vague flow of different emotions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The last time I asked you, are you really sent to spy on our undercover agent of Qingyun secret method?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan bit his lips and knelt down to him slowly: &ldquo;master, I&rsquo;m not. I didn&rsquo;t do anything sorry to you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He is low and low. It&rsquo;s not easy for him to get to the field, as if he was also determined by his deep heart.</p>
<p>In the sunshine, there seems to be a sigh. When Zhang Xiaofan looks up again, the familiar figure has disappeared.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan stared at the door, kept this posture for a long time, then slowly stood up, walked back to the bedside and sat down.</p>
<p>Monkey Xiaohui is awakened by his actions, turns around, sees Zhang Xiaofan, grins, as if after sleeping, the spirit begins to recover, and then jumps to him.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan subconsciously rings around and holds the ash in his arms, but his eyes are still looking out of the door. For a long time, he used the voice that only he himself, or even Xiaohui, could hear, and said in a low voice: &ldquo;you know, I promised that man at the beginning, I would not say, I would not say&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohui doesn&rsquo;t know if she understands it, but she obviously doesn&rsquo;t care. She reaches out and grabs Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s hair.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan did not move. Let little grey act, only slowly say in the mouth: &ldquo;only you, little grey, now only you are with me&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little grey squeaked twice. He he laughs and doesn&rsquo;t know if he understands. In the distance, rhubarb seems to be sleeping again. In the sleep, its tail rolls up quietly. He shrank under himself.</p>
<p>The sun was still shining softly. Du Bishu, standing outside the door, could not help yawning. But after a while, the original faint sleepiness disappeared. Tian could not easily walk out of Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master.&rdquo; Du Bishu called out, looking at Tian&rsquo;s face carefully, hoping to see something from his face. But Tian&rsquo;s face was expressionless. He nodded slightly and walked by him like this. Go to Shoujing hall.</p>
<p>Du Bishu Gong stood aside and waited for Tian not to go far. Looking at his back, he thought about Zhang Xiaofan. He sighed. No one could have imagined that such a thing would happen to this ordinary junior brother in the past.</p>
<p>At this moment, even he, who has always been lively and active in his daily life, can&rsquo;t help but feel a little listless. In my heart, I was worried about Zhang Xiaofan.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t know how long it took until he heard a cry from behind: &ldquo;sixth elder martial brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Du Bishu was startled and turned to look at it. He was shocked. Zhang Xiaofan came out of the room and stood behind him. Monkey Xiaohui lies on his shoulder and is looking at him with a split mouth and a smile. However, rhubarb hasn&rsquo;t followed him. Most of them are still sleeping.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Er, junior brother!&rdquo; Du Bishu frowned. &ldquo;What can I do for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan took a look at him and slowly said, &ldquo;elder martial brother six, I want to go to Houshan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Du Bishu hears the words, he is in a bit of a dilemma. Since returning to the mountain, Tian Changyi has not directly ordered people to monitor Zhang Xiaofan, but Su Ru, the teacher&rsquo;s mother, has secretly explained to the people.</p>
<p>But at the moment, looking at the honest younger martial brother in the past, his face is haggard. Du Bishu is really impatient, but he doesn&rsquo;t dare to disobey the meaning of the school in any case. After a while, he says: &ldquo;younger martial brother, you, you know now I, I&hellip;&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan lowered his head silently and said softly: &ldquo;tomorrow, master daoxuan is going to let me go to Tongtian peak. I want to see the place before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Du Bishu&rsquo;s body shook and his mouth slightly widened. Suddenly, he felt the heat in his eyes. The young man standing in front of him seemed to be the ordinary child who just went up the mountain many years ago. On the dining table, he and he bet on the master&rsquo;s family who is the advanced kitchen</p>
<p>However, he did not dare to disobey the order of the school. He was in a dilemma. Suddenly, he heard a sound of footsteps. The two turned their heads and looked at it, but Tian linger came over with a complex expression.</p>
<p>This is the first time Zhang Xiaofan has seen Tian ling&rsquo;er in three days. She looks pale, as if she is haggard. I think she is not very relieved these days, but she is still so beautiful in this sunshine.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan lowers his head.</p>
<p>Tian ling&rsquo;er went to the two and said to Du Bishu, but his eyes were all on Zhang Xiaofan. &ldquo;Six elder martial brother, my father said that Xiaofan can&rsquo;t do anything. Let him go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Du Bishu was stunned, and Zhang Xiaofan seemed to shake a little. He slowly turned around and looked towards Shoujing hall, but only saw the deep mouth of the hall, which was not easy for Tian.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan slowly bowed to the direction of Shoujing hall, with a low voice as if with some choking, and said: &ldquo;thank you, master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian ling&rsquo;er stood aside and seemed to want to say something, but at last she didn&rsquo;t say anything. She closed her mouth and turned back.</p>
<p>Seeing her go far, Du Bishu suddenly said: &ldquo;no wonder that this morning my younger martial sister and elder martial brother Qihao of longshoufeng had a big quarrel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was stunned for a moment and said, &ldquo;what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Du Bishu said: &ldquo;in the morning, elder martial brother Qihao came here. After talking with Shifu, younger martial sister pulled him aside. But before long, it seemed that younger martial sister said something, which made elder martial brother Qihao very embarrassed. Younger martial sister became angry.&rdquo; Du Bishu paused for a moment, looked at Zhang Xiaofan, and then said, &ldquo;I guess she mostly asked senior brother Qihao to plead with senior uncle Cangsong for you, so it was a big fight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan gave a low, wry smile, but he didn&rsquo;t know what to say. He shook his head and walked to the back mountain.</p>
<p>Du Bishu looked at his back from behind, but saw the monkey Xiaohui lying on his shoulder, and from time to time he grabbed his hair to play. He looks rather funny, but when he thinks of the fate of Zhang Xiaofan waiting for tomorrow, he can&rsquo;t help but frown and sigh heavily.</p>
<p>The mountain road from dazhufeng to Houshan. Zhang Xiaofan has not been through for a long time. All the way up the road, he saw the green side of the road and the birds singing. From time to time, they came from afar.</p>
<p>The oncoming mountain wind. Blowing in his face, brought a trace of cool, along this winding path, as if back to the past.</p>
<p>It turns out that nothing has changed here! Even the clouds as like as two peas in the mountainside of Dazhu peak are floating in the distance.</p>
<p>Monkey Xiaohui was very happy. He jumped down from Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s shoulder, squeaked and rushed to the grass nearby. Suddenly I climbed up a big tree and swung around.</p>
<p>Looking at its appearance, Zhang Xiaofan could not help but smile a little. He thought of the scene when he met Xiaohui, as if the pressure on his heart had been reduced a little at the moment.</p>
<p>Walking, walking, Xiaohui is on his head, running excitedly around the top of the tree, but Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s eyes are gradually only looking forward. That gradually clear, green bamboo forest.</p>
<p>How many memories, solidified here!</p>
<p>He is in front of the bamboo forest, stop.</p>
<p>The mountain wind blows. Countless black Festival bamboos dance in the wind and make a loud noise, as if they are also welcoming the return of old friends.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan breathed deeply. This world only belongs to this place. The fresh, sweet and free air.</p>
<p>Then he went in.</p>
<p>The green bamboo forest is as dense as before. In the soil under those tall and green bamboos, there are countless bamboo shoots breaking through the soil and growing freely here.</p>
<p>Unconsciously, he went to the place where he used to do his bamboo cutting work. He saw the thin black knot bamboo at the beginning, which seems to be thick now.</p>
<p>The shadow of the bamboo is whirling and the waves of the bamboo seem to surround him.</p>
<p>The past surged in my mind.</p>
<p>He stared at everything around him, as if he had lost his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zhang Xiaofan!&rdquo;</p>
<p>All of a sudden, a soft and pleasant call came from the depths of the bamboo forest.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s voice was so familiar when he was shocked, but he never expected to hear it in this place. He immediately turned around, looked at the voice, breathed a little, and saw that in a piece of bamboo shadow, Biyao stood there with a smile, a little tenderness, a little obsession.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You, why are you here?&rdquo; After two people stare at each other like fools for a long time, Zhang Xiaofan says.</p>
<p>Biyao came over slowly, even her eyes were smiling softly. She said in a soft voice, &ldquo;I came to see you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan felt excited for a while. He bit his lower lip tightly for a while and then said, &ldquo;but if anyone finds out, you will be too dangerous!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; said Biyao, shaking her head. &ldquo;I just want to see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s body shakes. This is the first time that he has heard Biyao&rsquo;s mind say so directly. As if noticing Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s surprise, Biyao&rsquo;s face was also red, and then said: &ldquo;your Qingyun gate has been stable for more than 100 years, and has been relaxed for a long time. I went up the mountain secretly, but no one noticed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan nodded in silence, but then thought that everyone in the right way now knows that Biyao is the daughter of the ghost King patriarch of the demon sect. If someone finds out that he is talking with her again at the moment, the consequences are unknown.</p>
<p>How clever is Biyao? At a glance, she saw Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s hesitation on his face. The original smile was gradually replaced by a dark one. She said softly, &ldquo;if you are worried about something, I&rsquo;ll go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan looked at her, but saw that although there was a happy color on Biyao&rsquo;s face, she could not hide her haggardness. If she wanted to come these days, she must be worried about herself. All of a sudden, his heart was hot and he blurted out, &ldquo;what else can I worry about? Can I be worse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>After seeing him, Zhang Xiaofan smiled bitterly and said, &ldquo;it doesn&rsquo;t matter. No one will come now. Please talk with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Baguio smiled and nodded, &ldquo;OK.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But after saying this, the two people stared at each other, but they didn&rsquo;t know what to say. The atmosphere suddenly cooled down, and there was some embarrassment.</p>
<p>For a while, Baguio said angrily, &ldquo;fool, speak!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan grabbed his head, but there was a blank in his mind. He really didn&rsquo;t know what to say to this beautiful woman. Just at the corner of my eyes, I saw a thick black knot bamboo lying on the ground not far away. After half a year&rsquo;s decay, it went over and said, &ldquo;sit down!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Baguio chuckled, like flowers blooming, pure and beautiful.</p>
<p>She went over, was about to sit down, Zhang Xiaofan suddenly pulled her, said: &ldquo;you wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; said Biyao</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan fell down and wiped on the black knot bamboo with his sleeve. He wiped a clean place. Then he got up and didn&rsquo;t look at Biyao. He lowered his head and said, &ldquo;now sit down!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biyao put away her smile and moved her lips. Her eyes only looked at Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s figure. After a long time, she sat down slowly. Then she pulled Zhang Xiaofan and said, &ldquo;sit down, too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan blushed and said, &ldquo;I can sit on the ground&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, Biyao pulled him hard and sat on the bamboo together. She said angrily, &ldquo;please sit down! What are you doing on the ground? &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan smiled awkwardly. He felt that there was a faint fragrance around him. It came from the tip of his nose and drifted into his heart.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t help turning my head to look at her. I saw that Baguio was also looking at him. Her eyes were like water, and she could not speak of their tenderness.</p>
<p>Never found that even when they were trapped in the blood hole under the lifeless abyss, Zhang Xiaofan didn&rsquo;t feel so close to her. For a while, he suddenly said, &ldquo;Baguio.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; said Biyao with a smile</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan stared at her and said, &ldquo;Why are you so nice to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biyao was stunned for a while, and slowly moved her eyes to the land in front of her body. Her face seemed to float a little confused, saying: &ldquo;yes! Why am I so nice to you? &quot;</p>
<p>Above the heads of the two of them, the bamboo leaves are swinging gently in the mountain wind, as if they are also saying something gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know my family background and the past?&rdquo; For a long time, it was a quiet tunnel.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan nodded softly and said, &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biyao said slowly, &ldquo;since I was a little girl, my parents have been gone. My father is busy with the affairs of the church and seldom has time to manage me. People around me always greet me with a smile and flatter me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was silent for a moment and said, &ldquo;your father is really concerned about you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biyao nodded and said, &ldquo;yes. But I didn&rsquo;t understand it until I met you. &quot;</p>
<p>She stared at Zhang Xiaofan and said quietly, &ldquo;Xiaofan, I will never forget that time in the blood dripping hole.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her voice, at the moment, seemed a little distant: &ldquo;it turns out that in the dark, even when I&rsquo;m dying, I can find someone to rely on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was moved, but he didn&rsquo;t know what to say.</p>
<p>A jade like hand reached out, and Baguio gently held his hand. From her soft skin, there was a touch of tenderness.</p>
<p>She took a handkerchief out of her arms and gently wiped the stain on her cuff just when Zhang Xiaofan wiped bamboo for her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From small to large, I don&rsquo;t know how many people flatter me and send me many treasures, but&hellip;&rdquo; She raised her head, stared at Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s eyes, and said softly, &ldquo;even if the treasures of the whole world are put in front of my eyes, they can&rsquo;t compare with the sleeve you wiped bamboo for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment, the voice of the whole world suddenly disappeared.</p>
<p>Only the gentle eyes of this beautiful woman surround him.</p>
<p>How many years later, you look back on the past, remember that year, someone to you, whispered words?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because young people with naive and fanatical words, do you remember?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the oath engraved in the heart, never give up!</p>
<p>Do you open your arms and hug the beloved in your arms?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know where to start. In the gentle silence, he opens his arms and hugs the beautiful woman around him. (to be continued. )</p>
