      <p>After a pause, Biyao looked at them carefully again, and saw that the strokes of these four lines were more meticulous, which was quite different from the Tianshu stone carving in the stone room just now. It seemed that it was the work of another person.</p>
<p>But the meaning of this is like the words of an infatuated woman, but how can it appear in the &ldquo;blood hole&rdquo; of this demon sect? It&rsquo;s really strange.</p>
<p>She thought for a long time, but still didn&rsquo;t come up with any results. She shook her head and was about to give up. Unexpectedly, when she turned around, she saw Zhang Xiaofan coming out of the stone room silently, standing behind her, and her face looked strange, like pain or surprise. She seemed to be a little confused. She saw that her eyebrows were tight and her muscles were slightly twisted Qu, almost ferocious.</p>
<p>Biyao was shocked. She couldn&rsquo;t help shouting &ldquo;ah&rdquo; and stepped back. The exquisite little bell vibrated gently at her waist, making a clear and sweet &ldquo;jingle&rdquo; sound, echoing in the cave.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan heard the sound of the bell, his body shook, as if he suddenly woke up, his face gradually calmed down, but instead he was confused.</p>
<p>Just now, he was in the stone room thinking hard about the Tianshu stone carving. Suddenly, the fire stick on his hand woke up like a wake-up call. The cold feeling almost covered his whole body in an instant. Then, he walked out like a subconscious until he saw the pile of broken skeletons.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan looked at the burning stick tied to his left hand, and saw that it was still bright, with a light blue light, and was mourning for the fallen skeleton.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan didn&rsquo;t know why he suddenly had this idea, but looking at the skeleton, he was deeply sad. Although he knew that the person who died here must be an important person in the blood refining Hall of the demon cult, maybe as Bagao said, he was the old man with black heart himself, but somehow, he was a little close to the skeleton.</p>
<p>The glow of the firecracker faded. Return to the ugly black, motionless, Zhang Xiaofan is still watching the skeleton, and then in the eyes of Bagao. Slowly walked up.</p>
<p>Biyao snorted and dodged in front of him, sneering: &ldquo;although I don&rsquo;t like the old black heart ghost very much, and there are different factions, we are all saints.</p>
<p>They all swore too much in front of the virgin of Youming. If you want to be rude to him, I will not accept it. &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan took a look at him and couldn&rsquo;t help but say, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s broken to pieces now. I&rsquo;m afraid he&rsquo;s given it by you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biyao&rsquo;s face was red, but the front of the words did not let her, and she resolutely said, &ldquo;I will naturally confess to the virgin Ming Wang, but I will never allow you to be rude!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan took a look at him and suddenly said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Baguio stayed, he looked peaceful. There is no color of hatred, but I think that the youth of Qingyun gate seems to be quite different from those righteous people who are full of benevolence, righteousness and morality. In hesitation, Zhang Xiaofan walked past. She hesitated for a moment and turned to look at him.</p>
<p>When Zhang Xiaofan came to the pile of skeletons, he saw that they were old and had a faint green luster on their pale skeletons. The skeletons below the chest had been scattered just after the attack by Biyao. Only the skull was still intact. Falling on the top of all the bones, his empty eyes are facing Zhang Xiaofan.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan shivered and felt faintly. It seemed that there was a soul in his eyes, and he looked at him. But after all, he went up and slowly reached out to gather these scattered bones together. The cold feeling came from the bones, but there was no fear.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like an old friend for many years!</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan felt relieved in his heart. Although it was strange that he did what he had to do to get rid of his mind, he really had this feeling. But he thought to himself: this fire stick is so strange. If you have a life to go back this time, it seems you must ask Master.</p>
<p>When he had finished this, he was about to stand up straight. At this time, he saw the place where the skeleton was sitting, but because he had swept away the skeleton, some handwriting appeared, and he couldn&rsquo;t help saying &ldquo;eh&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Standing on one side of the street, Biyao watched Zhang Xiaofan doing these strange things coldly. Suddenly, she heard a low cry from Zhang Xiaofan, which seemed to have something to discover. She was curious and went there. She looked at the place and saw that there were several lines carved there.</p>
<p>Bitter in heart, bear to look back,</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to live with regret.</p>
<p>The golden bell is clear and bloody,</p>
<p>All my life</p>
<p>In the fourth sentence, the strokes become more and more powerless, especially in the third &ldquo;Zong&rdquo; word, which is scribbled and almost indistinguishable. In the end, it&rsquo;s even more a stroke that has been taken, and it&rsquo;s broken. It seems that the person who wrote here is powerless to write any more.</p>
<p>In the cave, Zhang Xiaofan and Bi Yao are silent for a while. Both of them feel that there is a sad love affair between the two lines. The woman hurts her heart and the man regrets it.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan is a little distracted. Although he has never seen the unknown couple, somehow, he is still sad to see the remains thousands of years later.</p>
<p>But the green Yao standing on the side frowned tightly. She looked at the words directly and said: &ldquo;the golden bell is clear and blood sucking, the golden bell is clear and blood sucking Golden Bell? Ah! By the way, Jinling! &quot;</p>
<p>She seemed to think of something. She gave a shout of joy. She was in a happy mood. Zhang Xiaofan was startled by her and said, &ldquo;what happened to Jinling?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biyao seemed to be very excited, and her face was full of joy. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s lady Jinling,&rdquo; she said! Don&rsquo;t you know? &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan shakes his head in a daze. Biyao hums, stares at her, and then says happily: &ldquo;Mrs. Jinling is a great figure of our holy religion in the past thousand years! It&rsquo;s said that she is extremely intelligent and profound in Taoism. She has a great understanding of the Holy Scriptures. She has created a series of &ldquo;Hehuan sect&rdquo; in the holy religion alone. She is a first-class woman in our religion! &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan didn&rsquo;t have any interest at the moment. After listening to her, she knew that Mrs. Jinling was a character in the demon sect a thousand years ago. It seemed that she was very powerful. But the name of her faction was called &ldquo;Hehuan&rdquo;. Then she knew that this old woman was not a good person. It seemed that Biyao admired Mrs. Jinling very much.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan snorted and refused to take her words. He turned around and rearranged the bones that had been disordered in order to read. However, he had a strange idea in his mind: it seems that you are also an infatuated person, maybe you died for a woman!</p>
<p>Naturally, the dead didn&rsquo;t pay attention to him, but Zhang Xiaofan had a little more intimacy to the skeleton.</p>
<p>Biyao has been enjoying herself for a long time. He said to himself: &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine that Mrs. Jinling has a relationship with this damn black heart old man. Hum, it must be that the black heart old man has a heart and no lover. Deserve to be struck by thunder! It&rsquo;s best to die! &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; Zhang Xiaofan suddenly shouted.</p>
<p>After staying for a while, Biyao was speechless for a while, and then she came back and stared at him for a long time. She said, &ldquo;what do you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan said something.</p>
<p>He was right at that time. He was a righteous man, and he somehow defended a vicious demon sect murderer 800 years ago. If it came to the ears of Qingyun sect, it would be a heavy punishment immediately. But I didn&rsquo;t know how at that time. When I was excited, I blurted out. At this time, Biyao asked me a question, but I couldn&rsquo;t speak.</p>
<p>Biyao looks at him strangely, suddenly remembers something, and forgets Zhang Xiaofan. He grabbed the golden bell at his waist and laughed loudly: &ldquo;ah! Isn&rsquo;t this Mrs. Jinling&rsquo;s &ldquo;joyous bell&rdquo; In the middle of the conversation, I quickly turned the golden bell upside down and looked carefully. As expected, I saw three small characters on the bell wall inside the golden bell.</p>
<p>Joyous bells!</p>
<p>When Zhang Xiaofan saw Biyao&rsquo;s face, he was just too happy to laugh. It seems that this is a very powerful magic weapon. She accidentally got it. She felt uncomfortable. Cold tunnel: &ldquo;do you find a way out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Baguio&rsquo;s eyes were full of the little bell in front of her. She said, &ldquo;no!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan turned his head and said lightly, &ldquo;then you should hold the Golden Bell and die in the cave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as Baguio stays, she thinks so. Now the most important thing is to find a way out of here first, and quickly ask, &ldquo;have you found it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan shakes his head silently. They look at each other. Biyao puts away her smile and says in a positive color, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s find the way first!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At present, Zhang Xiaofan nods silently. Now they are looking for it together in the tunnel cave. Zizai carefully examined every wall and every gap. Zhang Xiaofan even checked the two statues of the virgin of Youming and the emperor of Tiansha, despite the strong opposition of Biyao. But he found nothing.</p>
<p>When they met again in front of the broken bones of the skeletons, they saw each other&rsquo;s expression of depression, and their faces dimmed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are we going to die here?&rdquo; said Biyao astringently</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan lowered his head, couldn&rsquo;t see his expression clearly, and Biyao was silent. Suddenly, the shadow of death covered their two young lives.</p>
<p>For a long time, in the silence, under the silence between the two, Zhang Xiaofan suddenly jumped up and turned away. Biyao was shocked and said, &ldquo;what are you doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan clenched his teeth and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll find it again. There will be a way out. We won&rsquo;t die here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But in his heart, there is still a word that hasn&rsquo;t been said, echoing for a long time: I will see elder martial sister ling&rsquo;er again, even if I die, I will bury it on the bamboo peak!</p>
<p>But Biyao didn&rsquo;t move. She just sat on the platform and watched Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s face. At this moment of life and death, she suddenly burst out a strong desire for survival and kept searching.</p>
<p>Once.</p>
<p>Twice.</p>
<p>Three times.</p>
<p>Four times.</p>
<p>Biyao can&rsquo;t remember how many times Zhang Xiaofan has been in and out of this cave. Every time, he returns without success, but he still doesn&rsquo;t lose heart, and he doesn&rsquo;t know why his temperament is so stubborn, or his survival competition is so strong. He keeps looking for a way out, all the time, all the time</p>
<p>Until, his steps began to shake, until he had no strength, until he walked past Bagao, the body shook, fell down, fell heavily on the ground, fainted.</p>
<p>After a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, Biyao turned his body over and checked to see if it was all right. She was just overworked, plus * *, so she passed out and let go.</p>
<p>But suddenly she was stunned. To herself, she asked in her heart, &ldquo;why should I rest assured? Why should I be relieved when he is OK?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The thought flashed through her mind like lightning and flint.</p>
<p>She looked at him deeply. The young man&rsquo;s young face was a little haggard because of injuries and lusts, and even his lips were a little dry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since we are destined to die here together, I don&rsquo;t want to have one person left too early, at least one person to accompany me,&rdquo; said Biyao gently, gazing at him for a while. It&rsquo;s also good. &quot;</p>
<p>She went out and came back to the small pool at the entrance of the cave. She took some dry food and water to feed Zhang Xiaofan.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, Zhang xiaofanxu was the cause of coma. I can&rsquo;t eat any dry food at all. I just recite in the water bag of Baguio vaguely</p>
<p>After a long day&rsquo;s work, Biyao is tired. After watching Zhang Xiaofan seem to be stable, she gradually closes her eyes. I fell asleep.</p>
<p>After sleeping for a long time, Biyao woke up. The first reaction was to look at Zhang Xiaofan immediately. Zhang Xiaofan was still lying there, motionless and sleeping soundly. Then she let go of her mind, but she could not help but scold in a low voice: &ldquo;how can it be like a dead pig!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said, I also smile, as if looking at the youth. Her mood is better. Even for the coming death, which is not far ahead, she has forgotten for a while.</p>
<p>However, she suddenly felt that Zhang Xiaofan was still sleeping, but her face was flushed, and something was wrong. She quickly reached out to check it. When she touched it, it was hot and hot, and she was shocked at the moment. Unexpectedly, Zhang Xiaofan was neither ill nor ill. A high fever came at this juncture.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, people in practice are naturally strong and do not get sick in ordinary times. However, Zhang Xiaofan suffered a lot in the past few days. He was exhausted, and his body was also greatly damaged. At last, he searched for a way out in this blood hole regardless of his body. His physical strength was overdrawn. After he passed out of coma. It was a high fever.</p>
<p>His illness is very serious. Even for a long time, his fever did not subside (in the cave, Bagao did not know how many days passed). Bagao had no choice but to take more cold water to cool him, but it was useless.</p>
<p>Later, Zhang Xiaofan began to talk nonsense because of the high temperature. Biyao was worried. When she thought that she would die alone in the empty cave in the future, it was almost creepy. Now it was Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s nonsense. Even if she breathed, it was almost like fairy music compared with the terrible days in the future.</p>
<p>But let Biyao try his best to get more water. In this cave, there is no doctor or medicine. How can Zhang Xiaofan help? His condition is more and more serious day by day, and the frequency of his nonsense is more and more frequent.</p>
<p>On this day, Biyao was guarding Zhang Xiaofan in a daze. Suddenly, she saw him turn over. The whole person shrank and screamed in a daze: &ldquo;ghost, ghost, ghost&hellip;&rdquo; Suddenly he gnashed his teeth again: &ldquo;you killed my father and mother, killed all the people in the village, and I fought with you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biyao was frightened, and immediately hugged him, saying: &ldquo;no, no! There&rsquo;s no ghost here! &quot;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if her words played a role, Zhang Xiaofan gradually calmed down, and the look of fear on his face was slowly flattened, but what followed was an expression of heartbreak.</p>
<p>He kept his eyes closed all the time and said in a low voice: &ldquo;elder martial sister, elder martial sister, don&rsquo;t ignore me, I, I think Don&rsquo;t ignore me&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>Bi Yao a stay: the heart suddenly a burst of pain, but also do not know where the courage, soft voice way: &ldquo;no! Your elder martial sister is here and will not ignore you. &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan smiled, as if this was the moment when he was the most i.f</p>
<p>Baguio looked at his face with a trace of happiness in pain, and her heart had a trace of pain.</p>
<p>What kind of person is the woman he is so attached to, the elder martial sister who can&rsquo;t forget even in his coma?</p>
<p>She suddenly remembered the Qingyun sect female disciple with the blue fairy sword that Zhang Xiaofan tried to defend under the dead soul abyss that day. Is that her?</p>
<p>Biyao frowns. She remembers clearly that the woman has a beautiful face. It&rsquo;s not too much to say that she is the best in the country. No wonder this Zhang Xiaofan will be fascinated by her! However, no matter how clever Ren Biyao is, he will not know. What Zhang Xiaofan is thinking about is Tian ling&rsquo;er, who is still on the bamboo peak of Qingyun Mountain.</p>
<p>In the next few days, Biyao, who had been guarding Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s side, heard more about him from Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s nonsense, knew that he was born in a place called &ldquo;Caomiao village&rdquo;, knew the terrible massacre in the village, and knew that the woman he cherished in his heart was his elder martial sister on dazhufeng, but she was not sure that this elder martial sister was his elder martial sister It&rsquo;s not the woman holding the blue fairy sword that day.</p>
<p>However, in the care of Zhang Xiaofan these days, even Biyao herself felt that she had a strange feeling for the young man. Staring at his haggard face every day could almost be the only way for her to spend her boring time.</p>
<p>She often gazed at him like this for a long time, but never thought that in the stone room on the other side, there was the classic book of the demon cult - &ldquo;heavenly book&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Sometimes, after Zhang Xiaofan goes to sleep, she slowly steps to the text left by Mrs. Jinling, stares at it for a while, and then gently says: &ldquo;madam, it&rsquo;s said that you have left a reprimand in ancient times. All men in the world are heartless people, but you can see that this man named Zhang Xiaofan is very infatuated!&rdquo;</p>
<p>No one answered her questions in the empty cave, but when she turned around, the Little Golden Bell sent out a clear and sweet bell. Beside her, in the cave, it echoed gently, as if it were telling something.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a pair of gentle eyes, a lingering ghost, staring at them and winding them in the dark. (to be continued. )</p>
