      <p>Bai Xiaochun looked at the overwhelming stones, and immediately ran back to the cave. When the cave array shook and blocked tens of thousands of stones, Bai Xiaochun was in tears and knew that he had committed public anger, but he was also wronged. He really didn&rsquo;t mean to.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I promise, this is the last time. I&rsquo;m very sure!&rdquo; He hastened to speak.</p>
<p>After all the people outside expressed their anger, Bai Xiaochun talked about it in the cave, and all the talents left with their anger.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun sighed and sorted out the stones in the cave, and then came to the refining pharmacy. Sitting there, he reflected on the scene he had noticed before. For a long time, he bit his teeth and carefully took out the last stove. According to his own analysis, he slowly refined the spirit medicine.</p>
<p>After a few days, Bai Xiaochun burst into tears and roared with excitement. Finally, he successfully overcame the serious problem of the explosion of the furnace, and initially understood the changes of mutual generation and mutual restraint.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Skilled third level elixir, just around the corner!&rdquo; In the days after that, Bai Xiaochun was immersed in refining medicine again, completely forgetting himself.</p>
<p>Gradually, the disciples of Xiangyun mountain didn&rsquo;t hear the roar of the explosion of the furnace, and they all began to feel relieved. The days of Xiangyun mountain seemed to return to the past peace.</p>
<p>But Dan Dan is always a high rate of refining, but still can not solve the problem.</p>
<p>In the face of these strange pills, Bai Xiaochun did not ignore them as before. Instead, each of them felt that there was a big secret hidden in them. Maybe there was a magic elixir like a list pill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You need to try them one by one. What&rsquo;s the effect of these pills&hellip;&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun murmured solemnly. He immediately went out of the cave and went to the square city at the foot of the mountain. He bought a lot of small animals to come back. He also used contribution points to exchange some of them from zongmen.</p>
<p>When he was raised in the cave, he began the second animal experiment in his life. He even took out a blank jade slips and prepared to record them one by one.</p>
<p>When everything is ready, Bai Xiaochun takes a deep breath and takes out a rabbit. He chooses a black pill from his many strange pills and throws it to the rabbit.</p>
<p>The rabbit smelled it and took a bite. After eating, it suddenly shivered and kicked its legs. It fell down and did not move.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dead?&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun opened her eyes and quickly went to observe. She was relieved. The rabbit was not dead, but the pill had a great effect. She was so smart that she fainted after the shock.</p>
<p>Until two hours later, the rabbit woke up and stood up like a man, staring at Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun gives a light Yi, but then, the rabbit also gives a light Yi, and Bai Xiaochun is startled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you talk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you talk?&rdquo; The rabbit also showed a startled look, learning to speak.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun was immediately excited and walked around the rabbit for several times. The rabbit was also excited. She walked around Bai Xiaochun for several times, one person and one rabbit, forming a strange scene in the cave.</p>
<p>At the end, Bai Xiaochun laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha ha, this pill is good. I&rsquo;m really good at white Xiaochun. This rabbit can talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rabbit also laughed, said the same words, Bai Xiaochun feel a little strange, simply opened a stone chamber door, the rabbit thrown in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, since you have your wisdom, if you succeed in your practice in the future, please come and thank you for your kindness. Shut it in first, and then I will release you out of the gate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After throwing the rabbit, Bai Xiaochun didn&rsquo;t care too much about it. He started the next experiment. This time, he chose a monkey and chose a yellow pill. He threw it to the monkey. The monkey didn&rsquo;t see it at the beginning of fashion. But later, he took a closer look, grabbed it, chewed it around his mouth, and bit off a lot of pieces, but most of them were still eaten.</p>
<p>After eating, there was no change in the monkey. It just seemed that there was a Yin wind sweeping through the air, and soon disappeared. Bai Xiaochun caught the monkey curiously and played with it. The monkey seemed silly and could only be in a daze. After confirming that there was no change, Bai Xiaochun sighed and threw the monkey into the stone chamber.</p>
<p>In the next few days, Bai Xiaochun experimented one after another. A group of rabbits, after taking its pills, became more red in their eyes. They actually growled and jumped up to bite Bai Xiaochun one by one.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun was surprised, while recording, while throwing these rabbits into the stone chamber, watching them bite each other, but there was no blood.</p>
<p>Some ducks were bought by Bai Xiaochun. After they were fed with pills, the ducks trembled and their wings were obviously broadened. They flew in the cave, and one by one they showed a sense of elegance. Bai Xiaochun was stunned. He was more interested in his strange pills.</p>
<p>As time went by, half a month passed. During this period, Bai Xiaochun recorded his own tests of pills one by one. From time to time, crazy laughter came out of his cave.</p>
<p>A few days later, when a few ordinary chickens took the pill, their bodies expanded rapidly, almost like the elephant. Bai Xiaochun had a deeper understanding of the magic of the medicine and was in high spirits. She continued to take out the strange pill to test.</p>
<p>Slowly, he closed the stone chamber of these small animals, and there appeared a group of toads with innumerable eyes all over their bodies. These toads kept calling, and their eyes were blinking every time they called.</p>
<p>There is also a tiger, which was bought by Bai Xiaochun with a spirit stone. After taking the pill, he actually grew eight heads. Together with the previous head, he became a nine headed tiger. Every time he roared, the nine heads yelled together, which was very impressive.</p>
<p>There is also a group of ordinary birds, no special changes, but the continuous diarrhea</p>
<p>As time went by, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s experiment did not stop. There was a great momentum to find out the effect of all the strange pills. Even a group of monkeys, after taking his pills, had collective epilepsy and convulsions.</p>
<p>Another example is that a group of cats are burping every day. Their voice is like thunder, which makes Bai Xiaochun feel very surprised. He doesn&rsquo;t know what strange pills he has refined. The most exaggerated thing is that there are a group of geese who, after taking the pills, turn their eyes into white, which looks very frightening, but they are very loyal. They are like dogs and give them to Bai Xiaochun on their own initiative Take care of the cave.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, Bai Xiaochun also tested the fish in the spring. The group of fish went crazy and rushed to jump out. One by one, they grew legs and walked around Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s cave.</p>
<p>At the moment, all of his idiots have been thrown into the stone room.</p>
<p>Inside, a monkey is leaning on his chin in a daze like meditation, a group of monkeys are convulsing below, a group of rabbits with bright red eyes are fighting with an elephant sized chicken</p>
<p>Next to a group of toads, countless eyes watching the excitement, there is a rabbit, in the side to learn a variety of shapes, constantly rowing, sometimes also issued &ldquo;eh?&rdquo; &ldquo;Can you talk?&rdquo; &ldquo;Ha ha, this pill is good. I&rsquo;m really good at white Xiaochun. This rabbit can talk.&rdquo; The voice, only these three sentences.</p>
<p>In the middle of the air, a group of ducks fly around gracefully, and a group of birds are flying like a group, and a puff of bird droppings fall continuously On the ground, the nine tigers are covered with bird excrement, constantly roaring, surrounded by a group of long legged fish running around. Behind those fish, there are several burping cats, constantly chasing the fish</p>
<p>There are several geese at the gate, looking at everything coldly there, looking like a guard.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun stares at the room, his strange Dan, at the moment only a part of the test, there are more in the storage bag, want to continue the experiment, but there is no small beast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The medicine is amazing&hellip;&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun murmured. After taking back her eyes, she was determined to test all the strange pills, so she left the cave, went down the mountain to Fangshi and continued to buy small animals.</p>
<p>But at the moment when Bai Xiaochun walked out of the cave, all of a sudden, the stone chamber, the object of Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s second experiment, had no change from the beginning to the end, but the monkey who liked to be in a daze and meditated suddenly turned his eyes, lowered his head and looked at the gate of the stone chamber. His body shook and went straight to the door of the stone chamber. Soon, the stone chamber door Yes!</p>
<p>Then, the gate of Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s cave was manipulated by the monkey. Unexpectedly It&rsquo;s also opened!</p>
<p>When the sun comes in, the meditative monkey rushes out in an instant. The other chickens, ducks, fish and cats all stay for a moment. In the blink of an eye, this group of animals that are locked by Bai Xiaochun All broke out and rushed out.</p>
<p>Zhou Xinqi just walked out of the cave at the moment. Almost as soon as she went out, she saw a group of ducks quack in the sky and fly away gracefully. Zhou Xinqi was stunned and looked at it carefully. She had already known all the five chapters of spirit animals in her heart, but she didn&rsquo;t recognize what these flying ducks were.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; When Zhou Xinqi murmured in surprise, he suddenly saw several chickens like elephants running around. On the chicken, there was a rabbit, growling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you talk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha ha, this pill is good. I&rsquo;m really good at white Xiaochun. This rabbit can talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhou Xinqi opened her eyes and did not respond for a long time. She was stunned and even had a kind of hallucinogenic feeling.</p>
