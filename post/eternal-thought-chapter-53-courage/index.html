      <p>Bai Xiaochun was pale and trembling in the bottom of his heart. The sense of crisis that came from all over his body made him tremble constantly.</p>
<p>He had never been so afraid, whether he was lighting incense in the village, hearing thunder, being taken to the ten thousand snake Valley by Li Qinghou in the clan gate, or seeing all kinds of powerful creatures along the way.</p>
<p>In those days, although he was nervous, he knew he was It won&rsquo;t die!</p>
<p>But now, he clearly knows that he Really will die!!</p>
<p>At the moment, he suddenly realized that there was no one around him. He was stunned for a moment and immediately turned around. He saw Du Lingfei and Hou Yunfei, who were surrounded by seven members of the Luochen family, hundreds of Zhang away.</p>
<p>We also saw the blood spurted by Du Lingfei. Anyone can see that Du Lingfei and Hou Yunfei can not hold on for long. They will be killed at any time.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s body suddenly stopped, standing there, looking at this scene, his body trembled more seriously, his eyes gradually bloodshot, he can strongly feel his body, his soul, are shouting to himself, let himself start to escape.</p>
<p>Even Bai Xiaochun has a certain degree of self-confidence. With his own speed, Du Lingfei and Hou Yunfei are blocking him. He has a great possibility Escape to heaven!</p>
<p>Once he escapes, he can live, he can continue to practice, he can pursue his ideal, and he will never die. Besides, the clan will not punish him, but will give him rewards.</p>
<p>But If he ran away like this, if he watched Du Lingfei and Hou Yunfei die, Bai Xiaochun would feel guilty all his life. He felt that his body was split into two consciousness at the moment. One was telling him to run away quickly, otherwise he would die. The other was to tell him that if he left the same door to escape, Bai Xiaochun would feel uneasy all his life!</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun was short of breath and gave out meaningless growls. His forehead was full of blue veins. His body was shaking like a sieve. He didn&rsquo;t think too much at the moment, and he couldn&rsquo;t think about the consequences. He held his fist hard. He only knew a little</p>
<p>&ldquo;Although I am afraid of death, I am You can&rsquo;t just go away! &quot; Bai Xiaochun suddenly hit his chest, his eyes were filled with blood. Yang Tian sent out a roar like thunder, and the whole person rushed out and ran straight Where Du Lingfei and Hou Yunfei are, go!</p>
<p>When he was too fast, there were gusts of wind, and the wind was blowing all over the place. Hou Yunfei&rsquo;s body trembled. He saw Bai Xiaochun. He could not tell what color it was in his face. It seemed that he was surprised and relieved. He suddenly laughed. His eyes showed decisiveness. He was not protecting, but exerting all his strength to rush to the people who had landed the Chen family.</p>
<p>At the same time, Du Lingfei, who was almost penetrated by a sword and cut a bloody wound, also heard it. When she looked up, she saw Bai Xiaochun, whose eyes were red and frantic.</p>
<p>Du Lingfei&rsquo;s whole person was like being bombarded by the thunder. She was stunned there, and her tears couldn&rsquo;t be controlled. She didn&rsquo;t know what emotion she was at the moment. She was moved, excited and shocked.</p>
<p>She knew that Bai Xiaochun was afraid of death, but now when she saw Bai Xiaochun come, she looked at the other party&rsquo;s red eyes and trembling body. She could not imagine how much courage he needed to No more escape, choose to return.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go, you idiot. Let&rsquo;s go. Don&rsquo;t come to death!&rdquo; With tears in her eyes, Du Lingfei yelled to Bai Xiaochun. She didn&rsquo;t notice a disciple of the Luochen family, who was on the sixth floor of condensing gas.</p>
<p>With a bang, Du Lingfei&rsquo;s blood gushed out. Her eyes were blurred. Her body was thrown up. A flying sword was not far away. Now, under the control of another Luochen family member, Du Lingfei&rsquo;s head roared.</p>
<p>When Bai Xiaochun saw this scene, he let out a stronger roar. His body speed broke out again in the original extreme. It seemed that his body had been pulled and directly cut through the sky. Unexpectedly, the whole person jumped away, driving his thin body with a huge impact force, forming a long rainbow. In the moment when the flying sword was about to approach Du Lingfei, he jumped away He appeared at Du Lingfei&rsquo;s side, hugged it, turned a circle, clenched his fist with his right hand and blasted toward the flying sword.</p>
<p>With a bang, the flying sword trembled and was hit by Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>This scene, let the Luo Chen family all surprised, Chen Yue&rsquo;s eyes flash, show a touch of surprise, but soon in the eyes of the cold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a hidden guy. I should pay attention to you when I&rsquo;m in the dark array. Don&rsquo;t pay attention to the other two and kill him!&rdquo; As soon as his words came out, the people of the Luochen family all around him were filled with killing intention and rushed to Bai Xiaochun in an instant.</p>
<p>Du Lingfei, who is in Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s arms, is in a daze at the moment. Before she can react, Du Lingfei has been put aside by Bai Xiaochun. His body shakes and goes straight to the people who come to the Luochen family.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s eyes are as red as blood. He has long forgotten death and forgotten everything. There is only one idea in his mind: save Hou Yunfei, save Du Lingfei and kill all the people in front of him.</p>
<p>As fast as he was, he immediately approached a member of the Luochen family who had six layers of condensate. Between the six layers of condensate, a small cone radiated light and went straight to Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go away!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun roared. His right hand suddenly raised and slapped him in the past. With a cry, the hammer shook violently. When he touched Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s hand, the light immediately broke out and was hit by a slap.</p>
<p>When he was about to retreat, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s right hand pinched a finger, and immediately his wooden sword flew out. Like a flash of lightning, it appeared directly in front of the people of the six layers of condensation gas. When he couldn&rsquo;t dodge or even had no time to react, he suddenly stabbed his eyebrows.</p>
<p>A shrill scream came out, and the wooden sword penetrated directly. When he took up a piece of blood, he turned a corner in the air and went straight to another person.</p>
<p>At the same time, the figure of a clan with seven layers of condensation flashed, and a large amount of fog appeared around the Jue room, forming a huge fog. After covering his body, he approached Bai Xiaochun directly. When he was about to attack, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s body trembled, but his left hand suddenly stretched out. His thumb and index finger flashed, and he ignored the protection of the fog and penetrated the fog directly 。</p>
<p>Break the lock!</p>
<p>With a click, the fog outside the body of the seven layer people with condensation dissipated. He opened his eyes and looked at the arm holding his neck in front of him. His neck, in this instant, was directly disconnected.</p>
<p>All this is too fast, from Bai Xiaochun to now, that is, a few breathing time, the two members of the Luochen family were killed by him in an instant!</p>
<p>This scene, let one side back to Du Lingfei&rsquo;s side of Hou Yunfei, inverted breath, eyes open, showing unprecedented shock.</p>
<p>Du Lingfei has been completely in a daze. She looks at Bai Xiaochun, who is quite different from her memory. She breathes so fast that she can&rsquo;t believe that this is Bai Xiaochun who is afraid of death.</p>
<p>At this time, several other members of the Luochen family finally killed them. All of them were shocked. At the moment, they all took out the most powerful mace. Among them, a flying sword, a bead and a small tripod ran straight to Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing that the three are working together!</p>
<p>The three men, two with six layers of condensate and one with seven layers of condensate, were extremely cruel at the moment. They killed Bai Xiaochun at all costs while Bai Xiaochun could not dodge.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s eyes showed blood. When the three men approached, at the moment when their magic weapon came, he suddenly shrank into a ball. The big black pot behind his back, which was ridiculous to Du Lingfei, enveloped Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s body at the moment.</p>
<p>A huge earth shaking sound suddenly came out. The small tripod, the magic weapon of the seven layer people, directly hit the big black pot. The big black pot trembled and appeared numerous cracks, but it did not collapse, blocking the small tripod.</p>
<p>Then, the bead suddenly approached and smashed again. In the roar, the big black pot couldn&rsquo;t support it. It exploded directly and turned into countless black fragments. When it rolled back around, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s figure rushed out of it and hit the people with seven layers of condensation.</p>
<p>The seven layers of condensation was a middle-aged man. His face changed greatly at the moment. He wanted to retreat, but it was late. Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s speed was too fast, and the whole person roared in, and all of them bumped into the middle-aged man.</p>
<p>No matter what the protective treasure of the middle-aged man&rsquo;s whole body could not be stopped. All of them collapsed. When the sound of bone breaking broke, Bai Xiaochun grabbed the middle-aged man&rsquo;s body and hit him again with his head.</p>
<p>Boom, boom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No The middle-aged man&rsquo;s blood spurted out, his eyes showed despair, unable to break free.</p>
<p>At the moment, the two clansmen with six layers of condensation are scared by your scene. One of them controls the flying sword in trembling and runs straight to Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>White small pure red eyes, simply ignore the flying sword, hit again.</p>
<p>Until the flying sword was near, a sword stabbed him, but an amazing scene appeared. The sword could not be pierced, and even the skin was not broken, it was directly bounced away.</p>
<p>At the same time, the middle-aged man screamed bitterly and was killed.</p>
<p>The two people who were close to Bai Xiaochun, who had six layers of condensation, were looking at Bai Xiaochun with his hair covered and red eyes like fierce beasts. When Bai Xiaochun looked at them, the two people did not have any hesitation and suddenly backed back.</p>
<p>Not far away, Chen Yue was more shocked by this scene, his mind roared, unbelievable.</p>
