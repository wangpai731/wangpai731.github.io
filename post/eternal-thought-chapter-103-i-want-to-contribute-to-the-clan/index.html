      <p>In this barren mountain range, there are not many disciples of Lingxi sect. There are about a dozen of them. After all, although there are few ferocious beasts for the inner disciples, there are still some dangers.</p>
<p>Therefore, those who think they are strong will come.</p>
<p>Under the intense call of Bai Xiaochun, all the disciples here heard his voice one after another. Most of them listened to Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s advice and left with the apology and thanks given by Bai Xiaochun. However, there were still two or three people who were indifferent to Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s call and pretended not to hear him, Even the bottom of my heart did not wait for the calling person to perish, take away the storage bag mind.</p>
<p>They are still alone here. They don&rsquo;t feel anything at first, but they soon find that there is something wrong with the fierce beasts here. They have changed their habits and become angry and crazy.</p>
<p>Shangguan Tianyou is also in the barren mountains. He once heard Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s call, but his eyes flashed and ignored. His next task, like Bai Xiaochun, was to look for a jimie beast. At the moment, he was very shocked. He saw with his own eyes that there was a giant bear which was comparable to six layers of condensation gas, holding a big tree and constantly hitting</p>
<p>This is not the first time that he saw such a scene. On the way, he also saw a rabbit who dared to attack himself. The madness in his eyes made him feel familiar with it and felt his scalp numb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something&rsquo;s wrong. What happened to the barren mountains?&rdquo; Shangguan Tianyou took a breath. He immediately thought of Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s oestrus pill, and his heart suddenly trembled.</p>
<p>At the moment, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s storage bag has more than 30 cores for sending out the beast. He is still spreading the powder of oestrus pill with excitement. Half a month later, Bai Xiaochun is surprised to find a mountain intersection in the shape of an eight character shape, where there is a big wind outlet</p>
<p>It seems that the wind around, when it blows here, will be attracted. From here, it spreads to half of the barren mountains. According to Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s judgment, in three days, it can blow through half of the barren mountains. Standing in this wind outlet, Bai Xiaochun needs a lot of strength to keep his body from being blown away. This is because he is not too close.</p>
<p>His hair was flying, and looking at the wind above, the whole person was excited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the best place to spread it!! And there should be no one in the mountains. I can harvest with confidence and boldness Bai Xiaochun was excited. In order not to hurt his classmates, he sent out more than ten cores in this period of time, but there was no heartache. After all, he was sure to get more kernels here. At the moment, he seemed to have seen countless contributions flying into his pocket.</p>
<p>He took a deep breath and immediately took out all the hair clearing pills. After crushing them, he scattered them to the wind outlet. Once blown by the wind here, he immediately rolled forward and spread most of the barren mountains.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun stands on the top of the mountain, looking at the earth and the jungle with pride, feeling like a master, you ran up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not easy for me, Bai Xiaochun, to benefit the barren mountains. How many years later, there will be more and more fierce animals in this mountain range It&rsquo;s all my credit. &quot;</p>
<p>When he sighed, a roar came out from the jungle far away. Then, countless hisses and roars echoed one after another, and soon This roar is more and more, spreading constantly. One day later, 20% of the barren mountain areas Three days later A half wild mountain, completely wild!</p>
<p>When this half of the barren mountains are crazy, Bai Xiaochun flies out quickly. At every other distance, he throws down most of the female Xiangdan. After attracting all the fierce animals in this area, he harvests the core of the killing animals.</p>
<p>Along the way, he was very satisfied, not only harvesting the core, but also the satisfaction of benefiting the whole barren mountains. Especially, he saw that the fierce beasts began to pounce on each other one by one after they were in heat. The feeling of benefit was even stronger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a good man, and all the fierce beasts in this mountain range will be grateful to me.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun flies out quickly and throws down lots of female fragrant pills.</p>
<p>In the mountains, the disciples of lingxizong who ignored Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s cry before were all stunned. They looked at the wild beasts around them, especially those fierce beasts who actually rushed to each other Everyone took a breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This What&rsquo;s going on here? &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This scene Why are you so familiar with&hellip; &quot; All of these disciples were shocked, and they all ran away one by one and wanted to leave here.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bai Xiaochun Shangguan Tianyou didn&rsquo;t care to kill the beast and ran away. He thought it was too terrible here. Especially after the scene of beihanlie appeared in his mind, Shangguan Tianyou was pale and shivering.</p>
<p>But almost all of them are in the deep of the barren mountains. It&rsquo;s not so easy to leave, especially when the fierce beasts in the half barren mountains are crazy</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun was happy all the way and ran by, sometimes throwing down the oestrus pill. After attracting a large number of fierce animals, he harvested the kernel. Half a month later, when he left the barren mountains, there were nearly 200 cores in his storage bag.</p>
<p>Satisfied, Bai Xiaochun left the barren mountains and went straight to zongmen.</p>
<p>Until Bai Xiaochun left for a few days, Shangguan Tianyou and others came out one by one. Everyone looked miserable and dishevelled. Most of them were at a loss. When they walked out of the mountains, they looked up to the sky and gave a shrill voice.</p>
<p>As for what happened to them in the mountains It has become an eternal mystery.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun galloped all the way back to the sect with excitement and went to the mission. When the disciples of the mission saw that Bai Xiaochun had taken out nearly 200 cores of killing animals in one breath, her eyes almost fell off. I couldn&rsquo;t believe it. After every one of them checked in detail, he was stunned when he looked at Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>He has been in this mission for many years, and the task of killing animals often appears. But the most important task is to bring back dozens of cores, which still takes a year.</p>
<p>But Bai Xiaochun here, just went for a few months, came back, actually took so much.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is worthy of being the leader&rsquo;s younger brother, the glorious disciple, and the first Bai Xiaochun in Tianjiao&rsquo;s battle&hellip;&rdquo; The inner disciple took a breath and was extremely respectful to Bai Xiaochun. After counting, Bai Xiaochun took nearly 200000 contribution points and tried to show a light hearted appearance. However, he could not hide his pride.</p>
<p>The incident also caused a stir in Nan&rsquo;an. Anyone who heard about it would be unbelievable if he got 200000 contribution points at one time. However, after those disciples who were persuaded by Bai Xiaochun in the barren mountains told others the reason with a wry smile, every inner disciple in the three mountains on the south bank would be shocked when they saw Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a cruel master!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s crazy. He&rsquo;s even given half a barren mountain range estrus Dan!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go there in a short time&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the discussion, Shangguan Tianyou and several other confused disciples came back one after another. Shangguan Tianyou knew that it was Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s fault, which was a little better, but the other few realized that each of them was howling bitterly, almost bleeding, but he was helpless to Bai Xiaochun. After all Bai Xiaochun that dense call, they have heard, the bottom of their hearts are in regret, if at that time a response, maybe not so miserable.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun is very interested in this task because of the harvest. Therefore, his figure often appears in the task, and every time he chooses this task of collecting things related to fierce animals.</p>
<p>It seems to be addicted. Every time I take the task, I refine pills, and then I go out immediately. Every time There will be some students crazy, whether they are involved in the task or not, will be crazy, because as long as it is the place where Bai Xiaochun has been, others will not want to go there for a short time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too dangerous</p>
<p>Yunduan mountain range, Hanlin mountain range, Jingfeng mountain range, Yuandong mountain range</p>
<p>In the following year, Bai Xiaochun turned into a task maniac and swept all the tasks related to fierce beasts on the mission office. Every time, he gained a lot. While making a sensation in the task office, he also made countless disciples more and more crazy.</p>
<p>Even when the fierce beast mission of Xiangyun mountain was gone, Bai Xiaochun went to Qingfeng mountain and ziding mountain again to snatch the task related to the fierce beast. This time, the disciples of ziding mountain and Qingfeng mountain all realized what is called mission madness.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, the inner disciples on the south bank were desperate to find that there was no place to go to the mountains near the zongmen, and there were countless fierce animals in the mountains who were in heat all the time</p>
<p>In desperation, Sanshan gathered hundreds of disciples from the inner school, and all of them went to the sect to ask them to be exempted from the mission qualification of Bai Xiaochun</p>
<p>Even Li Qinghou couldn&rsquo;t interfere with it. It&rsquo;s rare that Bai Xiaochun was so enthusiastic in completing the task that the leader finally had a headache. He found that since Bai Xiaochun entered the sect, he would feel headache for him almost every once in a while. Now he almost sighs subconsciously when he hears the name Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good that he is not serious, so serious It&rsquo;s really Ah, Bai Xiaochun, he is a guy who can set off wind and rain anywhere</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he going to make alchemy? He&rsquo;s going to make alchemy. He&rsquo;s out of the gate of contribution. I just hope he can calm down a little&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seems that the number of inner disciples in the book has increased from hundreds before to thousands. The headmaster gritted his teeth and discussed with Li Qing Hou that he was exempted from the task qualification of Bai Xiaochun for ten years.</p>
<p>He is the only one in the whole clan who doesn&rsquo;t need to complete any task in ten years and can get a lot of contribution every month.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun is also aggrieved. When he is optimistic about a task at the task office and is ready to take it, he is told of the result, and he is dumbfounded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zong, what do you want to do for me Bai Xiaochun angrily opens his mouth. Under the eyes of the disciples who are awed by the mission, Bai Xiaochun sighs. Finally, she lifts her chin and shakes her sleeve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s finger to finger, Mission Office It&rsquo;s gone. &quot; He shook his head and sighed, his figure showed a trace of loneliness, melancholy left.</p>
<hr>
<p>Stupid eyes Did not update successfully!!! I didn&rsquo;t mean to. I was wronged</p>
