      <p>This dream seems to have passed another millennium.</p>
<p>He walked alone in the dark until he saw the village, where the sun was shining and familiar. He galloped away, the familiar faces smiling at him, joking.</p>
<p>The fresh air seemed sweet to his heart. He could not help rolling freely on the grass near the village and laughing heartily.</p>
<p>All around, suddenly, there were many more children, who rushed over. The always bright surprised feather laughed and said, &ldquo;do you agree with this, or not? &quot;</p>
<p>Not satisfied</p>
<p>He murmured alone, as if repeating what he had said.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, the sky darkened, the black clouds pressed against the top, the low sky collapsed, the people around disappeared, the warm village in the distance disappeared, the darkness fell on the earth, only a faint light shone on the frightened and helpless child</p>
<p>Suddenly he exclaimed, &ldquo;I take it, I take it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turn over and sit up, sweating and panting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with you, Xiao Fan? &ldquo;A familiar voice seemed to be startled nearby, grabbed Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s shoulder and asked in a hurry.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan gasped and looked aside. Lin Jingyu sat in front of the bed, his face tense and haggard, staring at himself. Zhang Xiaofan was stunned and looked around. This is a small guest room with simple facilities. There are only ordinary tables and chairs and a wooden bed in the room. Now he is lying on the bed with a thin quilt on his body.</p>
<p>He lowered his head and settled his mind, saying, &ldquo;nothing, I had a nightmare. &quot;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu looked at him, his mouth moved, and his hands relaxed slowly.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was silent for a moment and said, &ldquo;where are we? &quot;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu hesitated for a moment and said, &ldquo;we have left Liubo mountain and now we are in Changhe City, a small inn in Changhe City, on the east coast. &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was silent.</p>
<p>The room suddenly seemed very quiet. For a while, Lin Jingyu suddenly said, &ldquo;Xiaofan, do you have anything to say to me? &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s shoulder seemed to shake. Looking up at him, this childhood playmate looked at himself deeply at the moment, but the eyes were so strange.</p>
<p>He lowered his head again. Slowly said, &ldquo;no, Jingyu. &quot;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu frowned, just wanted to say something, but finally he put up with it.</p>
<p>There was another silence, and Zhang Xiaofan said, &ldquo;Why are we back? &quot;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That day on Liubo mountain, after you fainted, everyone looked at you. At last, my Shifu and uncle Tian discussed and took you back first. There seems to be some confusion in the demon sect, and the attention seems to be all on the monster. Without more obstacles, we will return to Changhe city smoothly. &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was silent for a moment and said, &ldquo;how long have I been like this? &quot;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu said, &ldquo;it has been three days. &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan is silent again. Looking at his appearance, Lin Jingyu was annoyed and couldn&rsquo;t help but blurt out, &ldquo;Xiaofan, what&rsquo;s the matter with you? Why do you have it? &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jingyu! &ldquo;Zhang Xiaofan suddenly called out and interrupted Lin Jingyu&rsquo;s question.</p>
<p>Lin startled Yu and stared at him.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s voice was hoarse, and he didn&rsquo;t look at Lin Jingyu&rsquo;s expression and eyes. He just lowered his head and said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t ask, will you? &quot;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu bit his teeth and stood up. After seeing Zhang Xiaofan for a long time, he finally turned around and walked out, but when he was about to get to the door, he suddenly turned around. He said to Zhang Xiaofan, &ldquo;Xiaofan, don&rsquo;t worry. No matter what reason you are, I believe you. I will ask Shifu to speak for you! &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan sat on the bed, motionless. As if he didn&rsquo;t hear it, Lin Jingyu looked at him again, and resolutely turned around and walked out. Outside the door, Lin Jingyu seemed to be still standing. Lin Jingyu talked to them in a low voice for two sentences, and then his footsteps gradually went away.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very quiet in the room.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how long it took, Zhang Xiaofan slowly raised his head and opened the quilt, only to see that he was wearing the same clothes on Liubo mountain, and no one wanted to replace him. He subconsciously reached out his hand to the head of the bed, but suddenly his hand stopped in the air.</p>
<p>It was empty.</p>
<p>He has been following his firebrand for years, and it&rsquo;s gone.</p>
<p>He sat, his lips trembling a little.</p>
<p>Suddenly, he quickly got out of bed, ran straight to the door of the room, and opened the door.</p>
<p>There were two people standing outside. They looked back in amazement. They were song Daren and Du Bishu.</p>
<p>When I saw Zhang Xiaofan, their faces seemed strange. After a while, Du Bishu gave a dry smile and said, &ldquo;little brother, are you awake? &quot;</p>
<p>A ray of sunlight, from the sky behind them, shines down and onto Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s face. Zhang Xiaofan suddenly feels dizzy and shakes.</p>
<p>Song Daren&rsquo;s face changed. He subconsciously wanted to help him, but his hand just stretched out, and suddenly he shrank back.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was stunned and looked at him. He loved his elder martial brother since he was young. His face was as white as paper.</p>
<p>Song Daren&rsquo;s mouth moved, and finally he said slowly, &ldquo;younger martial brother, if you are hurt, you&rsquo;d better take good care of your injuries in the room first. Don&rsquo;t go out and walk around. &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan slowly shrank back, and when he was about to turn around, he suddenly couldn&rsquo;t help himself, and said, &ldquo;elder martial brother, what about my fire stick? &quot;</p>
<p>Song Daren and Du Bishu both changed their faces. After a while, song Daren said faintly, &ldquo;younger martial brother, your magic weapon has been temporarily collected by Shifu. Don&rsquo;t worry about it. &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan said nothing more, turned around and closed the door gently.</p>
<p>At the other corner of the inn, in a secluded room, Taoist Cangsong, Taoist Hetian, and xiaoyicai sit here together.</p>
<p>On the small round table among the three of them, there was a black and green fire stick placed quietly.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a hand reached out and took the fire stick, but it was Taoist Cangsong. He put the fire stick in front of his body and stroked it with his hand. When his finger touched the blood bead at the front end, his eyes seemed to have a light flicker. It took a long time to say, &ldquo;is this the blood bead? &quot;</p>
<p>Tian is not easy to suddenly snort coldly.</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai looked at the field and Taoist Cangsong and said, &ldquo;what should I do now, martial uncles? Please give me some advice? &quot;</p>
<p>Taoist Cangsong glanced at Xiao Yicai and said lightly, &ldquo;nephew Xiao, you are always resourceful. How about you? &quot;</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai shook his head and said, &ldquo;this matter is too much, and I don&rsquo;t know what to say! &quot;</p>
<p>Taoist Cangsong looked at Tian&rsquo;s face, which was not easy to be iron green, and said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the most troublesome now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the Taoists in Tianyin Temple who keep asking us how Zhang Xiaofan can cultivate the great Brahma Prajna Dharma. It&rsquo;s very fierce. If it&rsquo;s not for the leading Dharma phase, they still understand some reasons and try their best to suppress it. I&rsquo;m afraid they will ask us for people long ago! &quot;</p>
<p>It was not easy for Tian to say coldly, &ldquo;they want to take people? We have to wait until we find out. Besides, when something happened to our disciples, they couldn&rsquo;t come to intervene. &quot;</p>
<p>Taoist Cangsong frowned and wanted to say something more, but Xiao Yicai said, &ldquo;speaking of this, uncle Tian, I met elder martial brother li of the burning incense Valley this morning, and he also asked us for help! &quot;</p>
<p>The Taoist Cangsong was stunned, and the field was not easy to turn over. He said angrily, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter with burning incense Valley? &quot;</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai said in a low voice, &ldquo;martial uncle Tian, please calm down. In fact, I also think that burning incense Valley is unreasonable. Said Li Xun, senior brother Li. On that day, he and younger martial brother Zhang went into the lair of a group of evil foxes in Blackstone cave to trace a treasure of their burning incense valley. As a result, younger martial brother Zhang first arrived. When they arrived, they saw that the fox was dead, but the treasure was not found. But younger martial brother Zhang said that he had not seen the treasure. At that time, they thought it strange. Now it seems that younger martial brother Zhang stole it. &quot;</p>
<p>Bang, a big bang. However, Tian was not easy to get angry. He clapped his hands on the table again, only to hear &ldquo;KaKa&rdquo; several times, and the table shook. When he fell down, the foot of the table had been broken by the hand.</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai&rsquo;s face was embarrassed. Taoist Cangsong frowned and hummed, &ldquo;these people in the burning incense valley are obviously hostile. There is no evidence for this. Ignore them. &quot;</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai nodded and said, &ldquo;actually, it doesn&rsquo;t matter if we push away from the burning incense valley. But this time, younger martial brother Zhang is in front of everyone. Well, many of his peers want us to come out and explain why the evil things of the demon sect eight hundred years ago were on our disciples of the Qingyun clan? &quot;</p>
<p>Tian was not easy to clench his hands. From time to time, there was a slight crackling sound. His face was very ugly. He said angrily in a low voice, &ldquo;this little beast! &quot;</p>
<p>Taoist Cangsong said slowly, &ldquo;younger martial brother Tian, you don&rsquo;t have to be too angry. No one would expect this. But now it&rsquo;s too serious. It&rsquo;s even more related to the Tianyin temple and the demon cult. It&rsquo;s very important. I think we should go back to the mountain as soon as possible. Please ask the leader and senior brother to make a decision! &quot;</p>
<p>Tian was not easy to breathe deeply, but after years of practice, he forced his anger down and nodded, &ldquo;well, let&rsquo;s start right away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he turned his eyes and looked at the fire stick in Taoist Cangsong&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, Taoist Cangsong smiled a little, but put the fire stick in his arms.</p>
<p>Tian was not easy to change his face. Xiao Yicai also frowned and said, &ldquo;Uncle Cangsong, this magic weapon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taoist Cangsong waved to him and turned his head to Tian, saying, &ldquo;younger martial brother Tian, your disciples have done such a thing, which has already made our Qingyun sect lose face in front of the world&rsquo;s right way, and offended Tianyin temple. Are you afraid to take some responsibilities as a master? &quot;</p>
<p>It was not easy for Tian to hum. His pupils contracted and he said coldly, &ldquo;so what? &quot;</p>
<p>Taoist Cangsong said lightly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the one in charge of the punishment in Qingyun sect. I have this evidence here. I&rsquo;m sure you don&rsquo;t have any idea, younger martial brother Tian? &quot;</p>
<p>Tian can&rsquo;t easily stare at Taoist Cangsong for a long time. Suddenly, he steps out angrily.</p>
<p>In the streets of Changhe City, there are still ordinary people coming and going. It&rsquo;s very busy.</p>
<p>On Monday, Xianxian and Xiaohuan stood at a corner of the street, looking at a small inn with a plaque of &ldquo;Donghai inn&rdquo; on the front street, frowning together.</p>
<p>Xiaohuan licked the ice sugar gourd in his hand, making a satisfying &ldquo;tut&rdquo; sound, and then casually said to the fairy on Monday, &ldquo;Grandpa, are you sure that the people of Qingyun gate live here? &quot;</p>
<p>On Monday, the immortal nodded his head and said, &ldquo;nonsense, are all the people who practice the truth and practice the way who don&rsquo;t see the milk coming in and out of the door? &ldquo;At this point, he said to himself,&rdquo; these people have been going to Liubo mountain for a long time, and I don&rsquo;t know what the result is when they come back this time? &quot;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan gave him a white look and said, &ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t understand you. I want to say that you are from Qingyun sect! You don&rsquo;t dare to identify yourself; you&rsquo;re not! But you care so much? &quot;</p>
<p>On Monday, the immortal said angrily, &ldquo;Grandpa, although I don&rsquo;t care to recognize the younger generation of Qingyun sect, it&rsquo;s because I have already seen the world and would like to live in poverty. Wandering around the world, do something for the people of the world &quot;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan turns around and leaves.</p>
<p>On Monday, the rest of the fairy boasted, Sheng Sheng swallowed it in his stomach and snorted. At last, I took a look at the Donghai Inn and turned around and left.</p>
<p>Xiaohuan walked along the road: &ldquo;you&rsquo;re glad to say that we wanted to go to Liubo mountain to have a look, but after more than ten days of asking at the edge of the East China Sea, we couldn&rsquo;t find a boatman to take us. &quot;</p>
<p>On Monday, Sendai was embarrassed.</p>
<p>With a smile, Qian said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s because these boatmen don&rsquo;t know where the Liubo mountain is. It&rsquo;s a bucket! &quot;</p>
<p>At the same time, he thought that he would always mention these things, and he would lose face in front of his granddaughter, so he turned away the topic and said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if that guy named Zhang Xiaofan will die on Liubo mountain this time? &quot;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan gave him a look and said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t say anything. I saw his palms that day. Although this man&rsquo;s life looks strange, it&rsquo;s an image of chaos, but his life span has nothing to do with fortune, not a short-lived man. &quot;</p>
<p>On Monday, the immortal laughed and said to Xiaohuan, &ldquo;I am more and more curious to know what he saw in the ancient well of the full moon outside the black stone cave that day? &quot;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan chuckled and said, &ldquo;do you still remember? &quot;</p>
<p>On Monday, the immortal nodded his head and said, &ldquo;yes, there is no such thing as chaos. I&rsquo;m more and more curious about that guy now! &quot;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan nodded repeatedly and smiled, &ldquo;in fact, I am the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two of them laughed and talked, forgetting the front for a moment, and suddenly found that there was a figure in front of them. They almost collided with each other. They were startled. They quickly settled down. On Monday, the immortal said angrily, &ldquo;what do the milk do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, before he said half of what he said, his voice immediately became hoarse. Xiaohuan was a little surprised. At the same time, she looked forward and was shocked at once. I saw two people standing in front of me. There was a beautiful young girl in front of me. She was dressed in green clothes. She was the one who made them suffer a lot. But behind her, there was a woman who was dressed in black. She was still covered with black veil. I couldn&rsquo;t see her face clearly.</p>
<p>On Monday, Xianqian laughed twice and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m wrong, I&rsquo;m wrong&hellip;&rdquo; he glanced at Xiaohuan. Although Xiaohuan was young, he was so smart that he immediately realized that they were about to turn back and run away. Unexpectedly, they were picked up one by one by these two women. Then they shook in front of them. Several Street figures turned around and around, waiting for them to wake up By the time, it was already in a lonely alley.</p>
<p>On Monday, the immortal&rsquo;s forehead was sweating. He knew that the girl in front of him was far better than herself in the way of Taoism. He didn&rsquo;t know what she was going to suffer, so he had to face bitterly and say, &ldquo;this girl, I was wrong that day.</p>
<p>Ah! I&rsquo;ll give all the silver back to the milk! There is a lot of milk for adults. Let us go! &quot;</p>
<p>Biyao&rsquo;s brow was wrinkled. Since Liubo mountain came back, she looked a little haggard at the moment. At that time, she glanced at Zhou Xian and said, &ldquo;who wants your money? I&rsquo;ll ask you some questions. You answer me honestly. &quot;</p>
<p>On Monday, the immortal immediately said, &ldquo;excuse me, girl, I know everything and answer truthfully. I don&rsquo;t know if milk is about wealth or longevity, or marriage? These are the skills of the immortal Zhou people on Monday. Come here and let me make a divination for milk. &quot;</p>
<p>He said it more and more smoothly, but suddenly he felt that Xiaohuan kept pulling his clothes and turned around in surprise, saying, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter? &quot;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan was sweating. He gave Biyao a white look and said with a smile, &ldquo;well, this one! Beautiful big sister, what can I do for you? &quot;</p>
<p>After a moment&rsquo;s silence, Biyao said, &ldquo;what did you look at at at the gate of Donghai inn just now? &quot;</p>
<p>On Monday, Xian and Xiaohuan looked at each other and said, &ldquo;nothing, nothing! We just happened to pass by and saw a lot of monks there, so we stopped to have a look. &quot;</p>
<p>Bagao said lightly, &ldquo;so, where do all the people of Qingyun gate live? &quot;</p>
<p>On Monday, the fairy nodded and said, &ldquo;it seems so! &quot;</p>
<p>After a long silence, Bagao said, &ldquo;did you see the young disciple of Qingyun sect who saved you once? &quot;</p>
<p>On Monday, the immortal was stunned and immediately understood, saying, &ldquo;the girl&rsquo;s milk means the boy named Zhang Xiaofan, right? &quot;</p>
<p>Biyao didn&rsquo;t expect them to know Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s name. She nodded and said, &ldquo;why do you see him? At the same time, there was some concern on his face.</p>
<p>On Monday, Xian and Xiao Huan shook their heads at the same time.</p>
<p>At once, Biyao was disappointed. Seeing what else she wanted to say, she suddenly seemed uninterested and waved, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go! &quot;</p>
<p>On Monday, Xianhe and Xiaohuan are like listening to xianle. Immediately thanked her and walked quickly out of the alley. Unexpectedly, she took a few steps. Behind her, Biyao suddenly said, &ldquo;wait a minute. &quot;</p>
<p>On Monday, the fairy felt a little in her heart.</p>
<p>Just listen to Bagao slowly, &ldquo;what do you mean by the old well with a full moon outside the black stone cave you just said on the street? &quot;</p>
<p>On Monday, Xian was relieved. Hurriedly told the story of the ancient well of the full moon, and finally said: &ldquo;Well! That&rsquo;s it. It&rsquo;s said that on the night of the full moon, if you look at the ancient well of the full moon, you will see the one you love most! &quot;</p>
<p>Biyao&rsquo;s face changed.</p>
<p>He stopped talking and was stunned. On Monday, the immortal thought about the changeable girl. He didn&rsquo;t know what else was wrong. Suddenly, he was pulled by Xiaohuan. Seeing Xiaohuan&rsquo;s eyes, he came back to his senses. Now they walked out slowly. Biyao and the mysterious girl in black beside her didn&rsquo;t stop her.</p>
<p>For a while, there were only Baguio and the mysterious woman with black veil in the quiet alley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aunt you. Who does milk say he will see? &ldquo;When the words came out, Bagao suddenly smiled bitterly again, and the smile was sour.&rdquo; in fact, it must be his elder martial sister ling&rsquo;er, or it must be his peerless appearance that made Qingyun of Tianya divine sword join in. What am I? &quot;</p>
<p>The mysterious woman, who was called &ldquo;Youyi&rdquo; by Biyao, said faintly, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t milk like this, these men. Sometimes I don&rsquo;t know my mind at all! &quot;</p>
<p>Biyao closed her eyes and opened them for a while. With a hint of entreaty, she said to the woman in black, &ldquo;aunt you. I want to see him. &quot;</p>
<p>The woman in black immediately shook her head and said, &ldquo;no way. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aunt you, he is in such a situation that his life and death are uncertain. I, I and I can&rsquo;t let him go! &quot;</p>
<p>The woman in black sighed softly and said, &ldquo;the Father knows that the milk will come in disorder. That&rsquo;s why I was told to watch the milk. Now a large number of experts in Qingyun sect are in this inn. If we rush forward, we will not be able to escape. &ldquo;When she said this, her voice was a little more compassionate. She said softly,&rdquo; Yao&rsquo;er, we will see him in the future. &quot;</p>
<p>Biyao stood there in a daze and said for a long time, &ldquo;but what he did was a big taboo in the right way. Would they kill him like this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman in black frowned and shook her head and said, &ldquo;Bi Yao, be sober about your milk. It&rsquo;s not so silly in normal times. Zhang Xiaofan is now suspected to have something to do with our holy religion because he has blood eating beads. He even practices the great Brahma Prajna of Tianyin temple. This is really a very important thing. If we can&rsquo;t find out, first of all, Tianyin temple can&rsquo;t give up with Qingyun sect. I&rsquo;m sure that Qingyun gate will bring Zhang Xiaofan back to Qingyun Mountain. Daoxuan will make a decision and explain to Tianyin temple. So it will be OK for the time being! &quot;</p>
<p>Biyao subconsciously bit the pale lower lip. For a long time, she didn&rsquo;t respond.</p>
<p>When the woman in black looked at her eyes, she seemed to have some heartache. She stroked her hair gently with her hand and said in a low voice, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s OK, don&rsquo;t worry about milk. Didn&rsquo;t the Father also say that, he won&rsquo;t sit back and ignore it. &quot;</p>
<p>Biyao nodded silently, and suddenly she looked up, grabbed the hand of the woman in black, and said eagerly, &ldquo;aunt you, I know that milk has long been out of hand, but for my sake, milk can help him! &quot;</p>
<p>The woman in black was silent for a moment, her eyes moved away, and she looked out of the lane.</p>
<p>Then Bagao called again, &ldquo;aunt you! &quot;</p>
<p>The woman in black sighed softly and said, &ldquo;OK! If father decides to save him, I will help him once. &quot;</p>
<p>Baguio likes shape and color.</p>
<p>The woman in black smiled, but the smile was hidden in the black veil, and no one could see it, just like no one could see her deep heart, the waves of ripples.</p>
<p>On that dark and murderous night, when the young man resolutely rushed to the fierce beast regardless of his life and death, she was also in the dark, and her heart was beating!</p>
<p>Vaguely remember, many years ago, that a white figure like snow.</p>
<p>Even the look on their faces seemed to be somewhat similar. )</p>
