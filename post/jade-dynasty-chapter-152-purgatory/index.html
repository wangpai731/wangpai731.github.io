      <p>Huqishan, the main hall of the ghost King sect of the demon sect, is shrouded in a mass of killing. More than half of the original powerful sect&rsquo;s staff suddenly died, which is a heavy blow to any powerful sect in the world. So many hot blooded disciples set out to fight with high morale, but when they came back, there was only one ghost king with bloody body.</p>
<p>The lingering shadow appeared in the face and heart of everyone in Huqi mountain. No one knows who the next opponent of those cruel and ferocious monsters will be?</p>
<p>After the ghost king came back, he directly closed the door to cultivate himself. No one dared to ask him, but people didn&rsquo;t wait for a long time. Soon, the news came back one by one, and things gradually became clear. In this southwest war, the three major sects of the demon sect fought together against the monster demon for the first time. Although why did the three factions secretly form an alliance or have other plans, except the ghost king I&rsquo;m afraid no one knows.</p>
<p>As a result of this war, it can be said that the demon sect suffered the most painful defeat in a thousand years. The ghost King clan lost more than half of its manpower. However, the Wandu sect first suffered great losses in the internal strife in the gate, and then the beast demon attacked the snake valley. Some of the remaining master disciples were almost killed and injured. As for the Huanhuan sect, which has always been dormant in secret, this time, I don&rsquo;t know why, they also raised the whole faction&rsquo;s strength to join the war, and their end was also annihilated in front of the endless demons.</p>
<p>At this moment, the ghost King clan is in a state of panic, but in any case, their situation is still far better than that of Wandu sect and Hehuan sect. Most of the experts of Guiwang sect stay in Huqi mountain, so the strength of the backbone has not been damaged. After the battle between Wandu sect and Hehuan sect, it is not even known whether anyone has escaped.</p>
<p>This day, after training for many days, the ghost King reappeared in front of the disciples of the ghost King sect in the uneasy speculation of his disciples. As for the defeat just experienced, the ghost king didn&rsquo;t mention it. Instead, he directly issued multiple orders in succession, and soon. The whole Huqi mountain hinterland, began to stir up.</p>
<p>All the people began to pack up, pack things and prepare dry food and water. Because the last order of the ghost King clearly states one thing, because at the moment, the Middle Earth beast demon is rampant, and the vitality of the holy religion is greatly damaged, for the future of the holy religion.</p>
<p>He had decided that the ghost King clan would go up and down to the northwest and enter the wilderness, the birthplace of the sacred religion in the legend - &ldquo;the wild Temple&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In a bustling scene, the ghost king, with his hands on his back, walked to the cold stone room in the deep of the mountain. The journey was thousands of miles, and the wilderness was desolate and hot. According to the current situation of Biyao, it was not suitable to go to the wilderness for a long time. Originally in the mind of the ghost king. I want to ask Xiaobai to take care of Biyao. With the Jiuwei Tianhu&rsquo;s thousand years of practice, and the numerous mechanisms in huqishan, it&rsquo;s natural that everything is safe. But now things have changed. Since he came back, somehow, Xiaobai disappeared from here. He asked several people, but none of them knew where she was.</p>
<p>Thinking of this, the ghost King frowned slightly. Unconsciously found that he had come to his daughter&rsquo;s cold stone room outside, he sighed, opened the door and walked in.</p>
<p>Ghost Li is standing there, quietly accompany Biyao. I heard something behind me. But he didn&rsquo;t even move his head.</p>
<p>The ghost King walked slowly and walked to the ghost Li body. From his body, he looked at his daughter who was lying on the cold stone platform quietly. The pale and beautiful face was as beautiful as ever. It was as if she knew that the two men who cared about her most in the world. And the two most important men for her were at her side.</p>
<p>Her expression is very quiet, very calm, very at ease!</p>
<p>The ghost king looked at Biyao for a long time. His eyes twinkled with a rare kindness. After a long time, he gave a long breath and said faintly, &ldquo;why don&rsquo;t you arrange things?&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li didn&rsquo;t look up and didn&rsquo;t answer him directly. Instead, he asked the ghost king, &ldquo;I heard that in the wilderness, it&rsquo;s either desolate Gobi or endless desert. It&rsquo;s extremely hot all year round, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost King nodded and said, &ldquo;yes, I have been to the wild temple in those years, and the climate there is really so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li frowned and said, &ldquo;how can Biyao go? She is now How can you bear the pain? &quot;</p>
<p>The ghost king looked at GUI Li and said, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to take Yao&rsquo;er to the wild.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Looking at the ghost king, the ghost king said: &ldquo;the wild, desolate and hot is not suitable for Yao&rsquo;er. My original intention is to let her stay in Huqi mountain. After we leave, we will launch the mountain authorities to ban it and close the entrance, so that it is very safe. But in case, someone should come in and check at least once a month to avoid accidents. &quot;</p>
<p>GUI Li stood up and said, &ldquo;do you want to leave someone, who is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost king said faintly: &ldquo;I originally meant to entrust Xiaobai. She has a profound way and is willing to have a good rest in this Huqi mountain for a few years, but I don&rsquo;t know why, I can&rsquo;t find her these days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li&rsquo;s face changed slightly. The ghost king saw it in his eyes and moved in his heart. He said, &ldquo;how, do you know where she went?&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li slowly shook his head and was silent for a moment. He said, &ldquo;let me take care of Biyao here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost King gazed at him and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you can take care of Yao&rsquo;er, and I can trust you. But now that the holy priest has been severely damaged, I intend to revive my prestige. First of all, I must stabilize the believers and unify the holy religion. You are the talent around me</p>
<p>GUI Li&rsquo;s eyes left Biyao for the first time, and slowly moved to the ghost king. Suddenly, he said, &ldquo;this time, those disciples who followed you out of the war with the beast demon all died?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost King&rsquo;s face changed and his eyes were bright. This was the first time someone dared to mention this matter in front of him. However, he didn&rsquo;t get angry. He just looked at the ghost like this deeply, and then slowly said, &ldquo;all of them are dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a long time, GUI Li withdrew his eyes and fell on Biyao again. After a long time, he said: &ldquo;although the devil sect was greatly weakened after the World War I, the Wandu sect and the Hehuan sect were completely destroyed. For the ghost King sect, which still has strength, it is a great opportunity to unify the demon sect. The current situation is like this. Even without me, there is no force in the church that can compete with you. &quot; He said quietly, &ldquo;but Biyao still needs someone to take care of here. You can let me stay and take care of her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost king looked at him for a long time, nodded his head and said, &ldquo;since you say so, I won&rsquo;t force you. Yao&rsquo;er is entrusted to you. I believe you can take good care of her, but remember. The beast demon&rsquo;s strength is terrible and sensitive. In case of emergency, it&rsquo;s better to block the mountain gate. Then you can come in and check it out once or twice a month, so that there is nothing wrong with it. &quot;</p>
<p>GUI Li nodded slowly, which was a promise. The ghost king looked at his daughter again. After a moment, he uttered a sigh. Turn around and walk out.</p>
<p>Just as he was about to walk to the door, a sharp voice came from behind him: &ldquo;Lord&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost king was stunned. Unexpectedly, GUI Li seldom took the initiative to say hello to him. He suddenly opened his mouth and said, &ldquo;what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a moment&rsquo;s silence, he suddenly said, &ldquo;do you hate me in your heart?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost king turned his back to him, motionless and silent. I can&rsquo;t see his expression.</p>
<p>GUI Li said slowly: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s because of me that Biyao became like this. In your heart, do you hate me very much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was indifferent, as if he was talking about a topic unrelated to himself, but the ghost king never spoke. In the stone chamber, two men stood back to back, and the atmosphere in the air seemed to be stiff.</p>
<p>Light smoke, from the body under the body of the ice stone gently floating, floating in the air, I do not know how long. Behind him suddenly came the sound of opening the stone gate. The ghost king did not say anything and went out quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boom!&hellip;&rdquo; With a low voice, the stone gate closed again. In the cold stone room, there is only GUI Li to accompany Biyao. He looked at the woman in front of him.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>In the ancient and dense primeval forest, there is a terrible and scorching smell in the wind, which is like ugly scars. The original green forest is full of traces of being ravaged by monsters, and huge trees fall in all directions. Countless animal bones in the forest have been lost everywhere, and the atmosphere of peace in the whole forest is gone.</p>
<p>On the day after he found the crazy demon disciple, Xiao Yicai and FA Cong, a group of seven righteous disciples, followed the increasingly obvious traces of the demon, and gradually approached the valley hidden in the deep mountain. On the way through the forest, everywhere they saw the scene, although did not see the human skeleton, but this scene still makes people moved.</p>
<p>In many people&rsquo;s hearts, they even thought, are these monsters really born to kill?</p>
<p>In the afternoon of that day, a group of people appeared on the broken ancient road outside the poisonous snake valley. The traces of destruction around here by monsters were so obvious that people could hardly see it. The ancient road was trampled by countless monsters and widened several times. There were huge footprints and sharp claws left by monsters everywhere Mark, the air is still filled with a smell of fishy smell, in addition, there seems to be a relatively thin but more unbearable odor, but no one can tell what it is.</p>
<p>Looking at the entrance of the valley in front of us, we can see the same mess inside and outside. We can see clearly the land and forest ravaged by the terrible torrent. The ancient roads are winding and winding. No one knows what else is left in the valley?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why, all of them looked nervous and fell into an awkward silence. Finally, Xiao Yi coughed, but after that, he found that his throat was dry and painful. He calmed his mind and said, &ldquo;gentlemen, it seems that the demon sect disciple did not lie. It should be here that there was a big war between the demon and the demon sect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked around, hesitated for a moment, and then asked, &ldquo;shall we go in and have a look?&rdquo;</p>
<p>No one spoke. At the moment, even Li Xun&rsquo;s face looked very ugly. A moment later, FA Xiang, standing beside Xiao Yicai, whispered a Buddhist name and said, &ldquo;since we are here, we don&rsquo;t need to say that we have to give up. Let&rsquo;s go in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In fact, everyone here understood this truth, but somehow, there seems to be a strange thing in the valley, which quietly affects everyone&rsquo;s mood and makes people fear. FA Shan, the younger martial brother who has been following FA Xiang, responds with a loud voice and goes to his side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo; It was not Xiao Yicai who said this, but Lin Jingyu. He held the Dragon Sword tightly in his hand, and then his face was solemn. First one of them walked to the poisonous snake Valley, followed by Lu Xueqi, and then Li Xun followed. Xiao Yicai and FA looked at each other and saw that there was a faint worry in Fang&rsquo;s eyes. But a moment later, the crowd went in.</p>
<p>So big valley, endless forest, people walking in the snake valley.</p>
<p>There was only a dead silence around, not to mention seeing animals, even the usual birdsong was not heard. The place around the valley seems to have become a dead ghost.</p>
<p>The smell of monsters in the air is as strong as the smell of monsters. But with the deepening of the crowd, everyone&rsquo;s eyebrows are more and more wrinkled and tight. At this moment, with another breath from the wind in the valley, the terrible smell that almost makes people want to vomit is getting stronger and stronger.</p>
<p>The mountain road is zigzag and zigzag, and people are paying close attention to the surrounding area and moving forward slowly. There is a corner in front of us, which is a mountain pass. Here, the smell in the air has become unbearable. Suddenly, Yan Hong, who was walking in the middle, rushed to the side of the road. Everyone else was surprised. Li Xun said in surprise, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s wrong with you, younger martial sister&hellip;&rdquo; Half of what he said, he stopped because he and others saw Yan Hong standing in the weeds beside the road, vomiting desperately.</p>
<p>No one laughed, because nobody knew how long he could last. Although the valley has not yet revealed its true features, it seems to be more terrible than most of the world. Yanhong stopped panting, pale, and went back to the people. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I-I&rsquo;m really&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>FA Xiang reluctantly smiles and says, &ldquo;younger martial sister Yan, it doesn&rsquo;t matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai also said: &ldquo;yes, no one can stand the smell. You don&rsquo;t have to care. If you can&rsquo;t, wait for us outside the valley first. &quot;</p>
<p>Yan Hong hesitated for a moment, but shook his head and said, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li Xun came over and nodded to Yan Hong. With a soothing look in his eyes, he said in a low voice, &ldquo;be careful, don&rsquo;t hold on to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yan Hong nodded and agreed. Xiao Yicai turned her head and said, &ldquo;OK, let&rsquo;s go on. I don&rsquo;t know what kind of monster is dangerous. We must be careful. &quot;</p>
<p>They all nodded and walked forward again. Lin Jingyu was still in the front. He was getting closer and closer to the corner of the mountain depression. In the palm of his hand holding the dragon sword, he began to overflow with cold sweat. At the moment, feather around the valley, the scene of a pale face, hard to breathe.</p>
<p>He was stiff for a moment.</p>
<p>All the people behind him immediately noticed Lin Jingyu&rsquo;s strange appearance, and they were all nervous. Xiao Yicai called Lin Jingyu twice in a low voice, but he didn&rsquo;t respond at all. A pair of eyes just looked at the front. Lu Xueqi was the second one to go up. Then Li Xun, Yan Hong, Xiao Yicai, FA Xiang and FA Shan walked one by one through the corner of the depression and saw the scene in the poisonous snake valley.</p>
<p>Then, all the people froze.</p>
<p>That is the legendary tragic Shura hell, such a terrible scene, looming in the clear sky and day. Innumerable corpses and bones were left inside and outside the house in the poisonous snake valley. Some of them were human beings, some of them were monsters, some were complete, but most of them were broken limbs and arms, and they were so fragmented that they could not be recognized. There were almost no gaps in the ground.</p>
<p>After struggling to settle down, Xiao Yicai and others continued to walk in with pale faces.</p>
<p>The scene is terrible everywhere, and the deeper the valley, the more tragic the scene is. The battle here can be seen without imagination. The bones of countless people are entangled with the corpses of monsters and monsters. The land under your feet has completely changed into dark black, which is the color stained by blood.</p>
<p>Walking into the courtyard, you can see the fierce fighting scars inside and outside every room and the entrance of important passageways. In some places, even bones are piled up high. Obviously, in order to fight for this small entrance, both sides fight endlessly, stepping on the bodies of their comrades.</p>
<p>In the courtyard, people began to see the bodies of several monsters, some of which were even bigger than the whole hall. But at the moment, the once ferocious monsters just lay quietly in the hell like place on earth, waiting to rot.</p>
<p>The stench of corpses in the air has reached a terrible level, but the disciples of the right path are better than they were just now. Because of the terrible situation in front of them, they are indifferent to the stench. However, no one&rsquo;s expression is good-looking. It seems that the faces of these people are almost the same as those of dead people.</p>
<p>They continue to walk deep into the courtyard, and more bones appear in front of them. Now no one knows how many demon sect disciples and monster monsters died in the valley. They almost subconsciously go inside, go, go</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s face was so dull, everyone held his magic weapon tightly and refused to relax at all. After crossing the sea of countless corpses and blood, they came to a spirit hall.</p>
<p>The reason why they can still see it is a funeral hall is that they can see a coffin in this room. Inside and outside the room, it seems to be the most intense place for fighting. It can&rsquo;t be described as a mountain of corpses. It is here that people found many familiar corpses in the demon cult: baiduzi, blood sucking old demon, Duanmu ancestor</p>
<p>These evil men of the evil cult, who once dominated the world, are now hiding in this place with their eyes closed. Many people&rsquo;s faces are still full of fear.</p>
<p>Everyone can imagine, but no one is willing to imagine what kind of scene they were before they died!</p>
<p>With the deepening of the exploration, Xiao Yicai and other older people have found more and more famous figures of the demon sect here, including the three major disciples of the poison God and many important figures in the Hehuan sect. It is the guiwangzong side. Although there are a lot of dead disciples wearing Guiwang sect clothes, the bones of famous characters are rarely found.</p>
<p>People slowly gathered in front of the hall. Seeing that the faces of the people around them were very ugly, Xiao Yi said in an astringent voice: &ldquo;many people have died here. The important figures of the demon sect are all here. It seems that all the poison gates are dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yan Hong, whose face was white and frightening, said in a low voice, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the same over there, too. There are a lot of Huanhuan sect dead. Even Madame Sanmiao is there&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s face was pale, her teeth were clenching her lower lip, and her expression was complicated. She could not bear it, she was nauseous, and somehow, she seemed to be a little afraid. After the last one came back to the crowd, she suddenly said, &ldquo;have you seen the ghost King clan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>All of them shook their heads together, and then they were stunned. Li Xun&rsquo;s face suddenly became more ugly. Xiao Yicai took a look at him and said to Lu Xueqi, &ldquo;many ordinary disciples of the guiwangzong have died, but they don&rsquo;t seem to see The bodies of famous people. &quot;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s face slowed down, but Li Xun&rsquo;s eyes suddenly brightened, and he said coldly, &ldquo;elder martial brother Xiao, do you forget that these monsters are all cannibals? We came in all the way and saw a lot of white bones. Who knows whether those demons of the ghost King clan have been&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow A cry interrupted Li Xun&rsquo;s words, but Yan Hong suddenly couldn&rsquo;t bear it, ran to the corner of the wall and vomited out again. Li Xun was stunned for a moment, and suddenly sighed and stopped talking.</p>
<p>As everyone knows, Li Xun&rsquo;s words are hard to hear, but this possibility is really great. Xiao Yicai, Lin Jingyu and others all slowly lowered their heads. Only Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s face was bleak, and her face was even more pale. Even her body shook involuntarily.</p>
<p>But this cold woman did not bow her head. She slowly raised her head and looked up to the sky. The boundless blue sky, even the clouds above the valley, were blood red.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s lips moved, as if to shout something, but, after all, what voice did not come out! (to be continued. )</p>
