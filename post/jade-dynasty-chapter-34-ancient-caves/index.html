      <p>Four people finally came out of the mountain of bat corpses, but they were all in a mess. They were covered with filthy and dark blood. Even the smell was very bad.</p>
<p>All four of them are from Qingyun family. They are always clean, especially Lu Xueqi from xiaozhufeng. At this moment, it&rsquo;s worse than cutting her three knives.</p>
<p>The four of them are busy walking to the distance. At the moment, they just want to be as far away from the disgusting bat corpse as possible. After a long walk, they came to a relatively flat rock. The four people patted their clothes and tidied up for a long time, but they only touched some sundries. However, the traces of bat blood and the smell of stench were still lingering.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan and other three men are better, but Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s usually cold face is like frost and snow at this time. She swipes on her clothes and rubs them vigorously. It seems that she will never stop until these disgusting things are removed from her.</p>
<p>But these blood stains seem to be very sticky. Soon, Qi Hao, Zeng Shushu and Zhang Xiaofan all give up their efforts. Only Lu Xueqi still refuses to give up with a white face. The three men looked at each other. Even the most experienced Qi Hao was embarrassed. He didn&rsquo;t know what to say.</p>
<p>Just when the four people were silent, only Lu Xueqi frowned and rubbed his clothes, suddenly there were several whistles in the sky. People looked up and saw four lights in the sky, two yellow and one white and one green. A moment later, the four lights fell in front of them. After a flash, four figures appeared.</p>
<p>The two on the left are two monks. The later one is tall, with huge eyebrows and eyes. He is full of flesh and faces. He is not angry but powerful. If he is not wearing cassock, he is afraid that he will be regarded as a robber who blocks the way and robs. But standing in front of him was another young monk with a head shorter than him. He was totally different from him. His skin was white. The eyes are bright, and the body is covered with white cassock. It makes people feel thin, but in any case, they don&rsquo;t despise it.</p>
<p>Two on the right. They are a man, a woman and two young people. They are handsome men and beautiful women. Standing together, they are perfectly matched, just like the golden virgin in front of the constellation of immortals.</p>
<p>These four people look to the four people of Qingyun gate.</p>
<p>When he saw the blood stains on their bodies, he frowned. The young monk, Bai Jing, first called out the Buddha&rsquo;s name and said, &ldquo;Amitabha Buddha, are you four benefactors under the Qingyun gate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The four Qingyun people looked at each other, and Qi Hao came out of the crowd. He saluted and said, &ldquo;yes, I&rsquo;m Qi Hao. May I ask you&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young monk smiled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the FA Xiang of Tianyin temple. This is my younger martial brother FA Shan. Next to them are two outstanding disciples of incense Valley, Li Xun and Yanhong. &quot;</p>
<p>FA Shan, a tall man, greets him in a voice, but Li Xun and Yan Hong of the burning incense valley are both proud and slightly nodding, even if they have seen the ceremony.</p>
<p>Qi Hao frowned and then ignored the two of them and said to FA Xiang: &ldquo;ah, I&rsquo;ve heard a lot about the name of the senior brother FA Xiang of Tianyin temple, who is known as a rare talent in the past thousand years. I can see it today. It&rsquo;s really brilliant! &quot;</p>
<p>FA Xiang smiled and said: &ldquo;elder martial brother Qi is really infamous. I am not qualified. But Pu Hong, my mentor, did not give up and taught me the true dharma in order to do some good deeds for the people in the world, but he did not dare to compare with other senior brothers of Qingyun sect. &quot;</p>
<p>Qi Hao laughed, waved his hands and said: &ldquo;elder martial brother Faxiang is too modest. Let me introduce some of my younger martial brothers and younger martial sisters to you. &quot; Then he introduced Zhang Xiaofan to them. Zhang Xiaofan followed them to see the ceremony, but somehow, he felt that when the FA Xiang introduced him to Qi Hao, his eyes seemed to brighten up and gave him one more look.</p>
<p>At this time, the face of Li Xun, who had been hung aside since the beginning of the conversation, was not very good-looking. After Qi Hao&rsquo;s introduction, he suddenly said coldly, &ldquo;elder martial brother Qi, you Qingyun sect have always been the leader of the right way, and Taoism is really unique. How can I see you today, but you are so embarrassed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The faces of the four people in Qingyun gate were all changed. Zhang Xiaofan was even more disgusted when he looked at his posture with his eyes higher than the top. He saw Lu Xueqi stop brushing his clothes at some time. His face was frosty and he looked coldly at the two people in the burning incense Valley, but more of them were looking at the beautiful woman named Yanhong.</p>
<p>After all, Qi Hao is very sophisticated. Although he is slightly angry, he quickly recovers. He laughs and says: &ldquo;to be honest, I came here last night with my three classmates. I was looking for the ancient cave of ten thousand bats, but I met countless bats&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the four FA Xiang people heard this, their faces changed. The tall FA Shan opened his eyes and said in a coarse voice, &ldquo;well, that&rsquo;s the countless beasts in the wanbat ancient cave. They are cruel and hard to deal with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Qi Hao is so smart. When he heard this, he knew that most of the four people in front of him had come a few days earlier, and they also met these guys who are very annoying. His mind suddenly turned, but he heard a long smile from Zeng Shushu behind him. He came up and smiled at him and said, &ldquo;elder martial brother Fasan, in this way, you have met these bloodsucking bats?&rdquo;</p>
<p>FA Shan nodded, looking straight, and said, &ldquo;yes, there are so many bats that we have to retreat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu &ldquo;ah&rdquo;, sighed and said: &ldquo;to tell you the truth, we also met those bats last night. We wanted to kill them for the people. Unexpectedly, we killed them from early to late. However, we could not kill them. At last, we could only chase them back to the cave, but they were also filthy. Ah, shame, shame!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked back at Qi Hao. They smiled at each other and said together, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ashamed! Shame! &quot;</p>
<p>The faces of all the people changed. The difference was that Li Xun of the burning incense Valley gave a snort. His face was disdainful. Yan Hong, the beautiful woman, seemed to be a little shy, but her face was clearly unbelievable. However, the FA Xiang of Tianyin Temple smiled and didn&rsquo;t speak. Fa Shan&rsquo;s face was admired. Zhang Xiaofan was stunned and looked at the two people with brilliant smiles.</p>
<p>After a while, FA Xiang said with a smile, &ldquo;the three elders of our sect want our younger generation to experience this event. Now the number of them has reached the same level, but the senior brothers of Qingyun sect are working hard. Why don&rsquo;t we take a day off first, and then go to wanbat ancient Grottoes in the morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this time, Li Xun, standing next to him, snorted and said, &ldquo;elder martial brother Faxiang is right, otherwise someone will find some excuses after entering.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In addition to Zhang Xiaofan, Qi Hao, Zeng Shushu and Lu Xueqi, who are from the famous family Qingyun, are not loved by their respective teachers, and who have no pride in their bones. Now Qi Hao snorts coldly and says, &ldquo;elder martial brother Li Xun is right, otherwise I am tired now, and I will save you then. There&rsquo;s nothing we can do! &quot;</p>
<p>Li Xun obviously didn&rsquo;t expect that all the people under the Qingyun sect were so arrogant. He was born in the burning incense Valley, so he had to be valued by his teachers since he was young. He practised Taoism. Among the peers, except for a few, none of them is far superior to other peers, thus forming an arrogant personality and how to bear this gas. Then his face changed. He stared at Qi Hao and said, &ldquo;in this way, elder martial brother Qi&rsquo;s cultivation is far better than mine. I want to ask for advice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about the school&rsquo;s face. As soon as Qihao straightens up, he will go out. Suddenly, Lu Xueqi comes out from behind and stands in the middle of the field. Coldly, he says, &ldquo;if you don&rsquo;t need to work with elder martial brother Qijia, I&rsquo;d like to learn the immortal method of burning incense valley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li Xun suddenly stayed. Although Lu Xueqi is bloodstained, the skin on a jade face is even white as snow. Although it&rsquo;s cold, in awe of it, Lu Xueqi looks at the beauty of all living beings. He had never seen such a thing, but he stayed for a while.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Dharma phase of Tianyin temple came out and said with a smile: &ldquo;elder martial brothers, we are here to investigate the rest of the demon sect. Before we leave, we must have been taught by all the senior teachers. If they know that we are here, we will do our best. I&rsquo;m afraid I won&rsquo;t be punished if I go back. Besides, it&rsquo;s also a small matter, or we all have to step back. How about that? &quot;</p>
<p>Li Xun has come back. Hum and look up at the sky. Although I don&rsquo;t speak, the meaning is quite obvious. At the moment, Qi Hao thought of the instructions of immortal daoxuan before he left. He also regretted it. He took the opportunity to step down and called out: &ldquo;younger martial sister Lu. Elder martial brother Faxiang is right. Let&rsquo;s pay more attention to harmony. &quot;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi looks at the crowd, snorts, and comes back. Seeing Zhang Xiaofan looking at himself, she glances at Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s face, and goes to the side alone.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s heart suddenly cools when she looks at her, and the feeling that she can&rsquo;t speak is all over her heart,</p>
<p>Just listen to the Dharma phase and say: &ldquo;in this case, let&rsquo;s go down the mountain first, and then go up the mountain to investigate in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this time, all of them had no objection, so FA Xiang led the way. All of them followed him to a small hill 30 miles away from kongsang mountain. There was a clear spring here, which was exactly what Qingyun sect needed. At that time, they combed and washed by the water and changed their clothes in a secluded place. Only then did they come out to meet with the people of Faeq.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi is the body of her daughter. It&rsquo;s not convenient. She can find the farthest place to change clothes. So the last one came out. Everyone saw that after she was washed, her face was radiant. She was a little more charming in the original beauty. When she arrived, her eyes were shining. Needless to say, Zeng Shushu, Li Xun and other people&rsquo;s eyes were shining. It was the silent burning incense Gu Yanhong who also saw her a few more eyes.</p>
<p>The eight most &ldquo;excellent&rdquo; disciples of the three main sects of the right way sit around the ground. Talking about it, Zhang Xiaofan knew from the Chinese side that the bats in the &ldquo;wanbat ancient cave&rdquo; in kongsang mountain were the foreign species raised by the evil cult at that time. They were cruel and good at sucking blood. They were originally the accomplices of the evil cult. After the destruction of the evil cult&rsquo;s stronghold eight hundred years ago, a few bats survived For a long time, it has been thriving. With today&rsquo;s huge scale, every predator makes this area totally uninhabited.</p>
<p>However, these bats seem to be afraid of the sun, so they only move at night. They live in the ancient cave of ten thousand bats in the daytime. Last night, all the people in Qingyun sect happened to meet each other. If they went up the mountain in the daytime, nothing would happen.</p>
<p>Hearing this, Zeng Shushu frowned and asked the FA Xiang, &ldquo;elder martial brother FA Xiang, since those animals are all in the wanbat ancient grottoes, how can we go in and investigate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>FA Xiang hesitated for a moment and said: &ldquo;according to my observation these days, these animals only hang on the top of the ancient cave in the daytime, and they don&rsquo;t move. Maybe we can go in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu was dumb, but Zhang Xiaofan couldn&rsquo;t help saying, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s to say, elder martial brother Xiang, you&rsquo;re not sure. Maybe those guys will rush over when we enter the cave. What should we do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the eyes of FA Xiangxiang, there seems to be some light flickering in his eyes, but his expression is still gentle, saying: &ldquo;that&rsquo;s exactly what it is. In fact, I&rsquo;m not sure about it, but I always have to do it when I&rsquo;m instructed by the school. If I don&rsquo;t try it, we&rsquo;ll quit. Today, I want to go in and have a look at you with my younger martial brother fahan and two benefactors of burning incense valley. I didn&rsquo;t expect to meet you. It&rsquo;s so good. How many people can take care of you! &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hum&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s Li Xun and Leng hum. The four people of Qingyun sect look at him at the same time, but Li Xun is not afraid at all. Only when he sees Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s eyes looking over, his expression changes.</p>
<p>Qi Hao doesn&rsquo;t talk to him. Turning to the Dharma phase, he said, &ldquo;one more thing, please teach the Dharma phase elder martial brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>FA Xiang said, &ldquo;elder martial brother Qi, please tell me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Qi Hao said: &ldquo;three months ago, my elder martial brother Xiao Yicai, a disciple of Qingyun sect, came here first. Do you know where he is now? &quot;</p>
<p>FA Xiang shook his head and said, &ldquo;we have not seen elder martial brother Xiao since we came here together with the two of burning incense valley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Qi Hao frowned and said nothing.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>The next day, the sun rises.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan and other eight people came to kongsang mountain, but they could not hear the sound of ordinary birds even on such a large mountain. They thought that if they had made dim sum for those fierce bats, they had already moved out of the mountain.</p>
<p>Faxiang and others came several days earlier and found the ancient cave of wanbat. Now everyone followed, carefully, and finally came to the entrance of wanbat ancient cave.</p>
<p>This is a huge half mountain cave. It is located at the back of the mountain, slightly inclined downward, with only a little light at the entrance, and then it is dark. Standing five or six feet away from the cave entrance, they all felt the wind blowing out of the cave, blowing across their faces, cold into their bones. At the same time, there are some rustling sounds, like whispering, like crying, making people feel numb.</p>
<p>Qi Hao looked at the cave again. Turning back, he forced a smile and said, &ldquo;so let&rsquo;s go in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When all the people were silent, the Dharma phase nodded, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s right. However, the danger in this cave is unpredictable. You&rsquo;d better prepare the artifact just in case. &quot;</p>
<p>When Li Xun, Yan Hong and the two monks of Tianyin Temple saw Zhang Xiaofan bring out a black fire stick, they dare not neglect it and take the magic weapon in their hands. All of them were stunned. Zhang Xiaofan blushed and felt embarrassed. Fortunately, at this time, Lu Xueqi said coldly, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo; He was the first one to walk to the dark cave, and the people hurriedly followed him, which relieved the encirclement.</p>
<p>As soon as I was entering the cave, the wind was getting colder and colder. It seemed that FA Xiang approached Zhang Xiaofan intentionally or unintentionally. Zhang Xiaofan felt it, smiled at him, and FA Xiang replied with a smile. At the same time, he whispered: &ldquo;brother Zhang, it&rsquo;s difficult in the front. You can follow me behind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was stunned, but he saw that the Dharma phase had entered the darkness. He could not think about it for a long time. Seeing that all the people had entered the hole, he hurried in.</p>
<p>Just step into the cave, did not walk a few steps, Zhang Xiaofan will feel a soft foot, the whole person fell down. He was surprised, but luckily he just got stuck in his ankle and stopped. At this time, everyone was already in the dark, but their magic weapon and artifact were sacrificed, emitting the light of Taoism. Zhang Xiaofan looked at his feet, and his face immediately began to suffer. It turned out that the bat excrement was very thick under his feet. The stench did not say that his feet were still trapped in it, and the taste was more difficult and more painful.</p>
<p>He raised his eyes and looked forward. Most of the other people looked the same, especially the two women, Lu Xueqi and Yan Hong of the burning incense Valley, frowned and looked pale.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan shakes his head and settles his mind reluctantly. After they get familiar with the environment, they go inside again. At this time, the whispering sound like a demon is also loud, as if it is far away, and seems to be around, around and everywhere.</p>
<p>After walking three or four Zhangs, Qi Hao suddenly whispered, &ldquo;slow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all stopped at once, and saw Qi Hao&rsquo;s icy fairy sword rising slowly, and the light was getting brighter. When the cave in front was illuminated a lot, they held their breath.</p>
<p>This is a huge cave. The top of the cave is very high from the ground. Under the white light of the ice fairy sword, people can see that there are countless black bats hanging on the top of the cave. They can hardly see the rock of the cave at all. And that &ldquo;rustling&rdquo; sound is the result of these animals&rsquo; friction and low noise.</p>
<p>In the dark, bats exposed to the white light seem to feel uneasy and move one by one, but they do not fly. Instead, they use their claws to climb on the rocks and move to the dark place. Some of them simply grasp the same kind of bats. Those fangs that grow more and more terrifying in the dark are breathtaking.</p>
<p>After a moment&rsquo;s pause, everyone realized that although the light here was particularly striking in the dark, these bats did not seem to move or attack. When they found this, they were more or less relieved. FA Xiang murmured, &ldquo;fortunately, I have no mistake in my judgment. Everyone, let&rsquo;s move on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then they turned their heads and went to the deeper and darker end of the grottoes. With the march of the people, the feces of the bats under their feet are thicker and thicker. Under the white light of the ice fairy sword, the bats at the top of the cave seem to be endless. More and more bats, with sharp teeth and sharp teeth, are murmuring and whistling around. If it wasn&rsquo;t for them, all eight of them would have been possessed of the Dharma of the right way and had a firm mind, then ordinary people would have gone mad.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how long it took for Zhang Xiaofan to walk in the middle of the team, but FA Xiang always walked in front of him. Looking at the young monk in front, he was also stained with a few spots of filth on his Yuebai monk&rsquo;s robe. Zhang Xiaofan suddenly thought of Puzhi.</p>
<p>Is the person in the deep memory from the same place as the monk in front of him?</p>
<p>In front of him came a slight cry from Qi Hao: &ldquo;ah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan didn&rsquo;t come back, he just felt that his feet felt different, as if he had stepped on the hard ground. (to be continued. )</p>
