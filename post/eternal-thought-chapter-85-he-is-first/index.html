      <p>Just when Zhou Xinqi was shocked, the wind came again from behind her. Zhou walked with a big stride and a smile on her face. She nodded to Zhou Xinqi when she passed by.</p>
<p>At the same time, with this smile, there was a vicious voice in my mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bai Xiaochun, I changed my mind again. After catching you, I&rsquo;ll starve for a month, and then I&rsquo;ll lock you up with a group of birds and a large number of fierce animals!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhou Xinqi stayed for a while, at the same time, Bai Xiaochun in front of her screamed bitterly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle Li, help, master, elder martial brother, master, help. I don&rsquo;t want to starve, and I don&rsquo;t want to be locked up with birds and beasts&hellip;&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun shivered. At the moment, he was scared to the extreme. His mind was full of images formed by elder Zhou&rsquo;s words. The more he thought about it, the more he trembled. The faster he screamed, the faster he burst out. In the blink of an eye, he disappeared.</p>
<p>In front of him, LV Tianlei turned into a flash of lightning and galloped forward. At the beginning of the journey, he was very relaxed, but gradually became difficult. Especially now, his area is full of wind blades, which are extremely sharp. As soon as he speeds up, he will immediately be like a magnet and absorb all the wind blades.</p>
<p>He saw with his own eyes a puppet thrown out by himself. Because of his speed, he was split by those wind blades in an instant. Seeing his face changed greatly, he had to slow down now. After a long time, he found a balance point and kept moving forward at a certain speed.</p>
<p>In front of him, the figure of Shangguan Tianyou could not be seen. When he passed through LV Tianlei&rsquo;s area, Shangguan Tianyou turned into nothingness and shuttled by without any attention from the wind blade, which made LV Tianlei, who was originally close to Shangguan Tianyou, hate him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just that you have the method of nothingness. What&rsquo;s so great? When I&rsquo;ve passed here, first It must be mine Lu Tianlei takes a deep breath. At the moment, Zhou Xinqi is no longer in the eye. He thinks that the only one who can compete with himself is Shangguan Tianyou.</p>
<p>But when he held his breath, he walked slowly in the area full of wind blades and was ready to fly out. Suddenly, a strong wind roared behind him.</p>
<p>The wind was so loud that all the floating blades around him trembled. Lu Tianlei was shocked and then surprised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha ha, it must be Zhou Xinqi catching up. This silly girl, the faster she enters here, the more blades she attracts, and I can take advantage of this opportunity to rush out quickly!&rdquo; LV Tianlei quickly turned back and saw behind him a thin figure like running thunder. In a flash, he rushed into the area of the blade of wind, and went directly over 30% of the area. It was less than a thousand feet away from Lu Tianlei.</p>
<p>Because the speed is too fast, the wind blades all around go together in a blink of an eye, and go straight to this figure. There are too many wind blades. Within thousands of meters, all the endless wind blades break through the air. In an instant, it almost forms a hurricane of wind blades.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not Zhou Xinqi? It&rsquo;s too fast, but I&rsquo;m just a fool. I&rsquo;ll kill myself Lu Tianlei first took a breath backward and was shocked by Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s speed, but then secretly pleased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cultivation depends on the head.&rdquo; Lu Tianlei laughs. Seeing that most of the wind blades are attracted to him, the lightning in his body spreads, and his speed suddenly explodes, and he goes straight to the exit in front of him.</p>
<p>But at the moment of his acceleration, there was a roar behind him, and the voice of Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s scream came out of the sky. His figure did not stop at all. He was faster and faster, and came crashing into the sky.</p>
<p>The number of wind blades around him is countless. All of them collide with Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s body, but his whole body is shining with silver. All of these wind blades, which are startled by LV Tianlei, collapse immediately after touching Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p>After countless wind blades collapsed, they immediately gathered together again. When the loud noise spread everywhere, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s body whooshed and flew directly past LV Tianlei.</p>
<p>And behind him, those wind blades that re agglomerate, with reluctance, quickly pursue.</p>
<p>Lu Tianlei was stunned for a moment, and his eyes were staring out. He felt his scalp numb and his mind hummed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; When he lost his voice, he saw with his own eyes countless wind blades chasing Bai Xiaochun. Unexpectedly Did not catch up, in the blink of an eye, Bai Xiaochun rushed out of the blade area.</p>
<p>The wind blade couldn&rsquo;t catch up with him. When he heard the roar of rage on the edge, he seemed to notice LV Tianlei</p>
<p>&ldquo;No No Lu Tianlei&rsquo;s heart cluttered, and he wanted to stop his speed, but he turned into a lightning figure. Even if he stopped immediately, he still let those helpless blades of Bai Xiaochun rush to him in an instant.</p>
<p>Soon, the shrill scream came out.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun ran ahead, vaguely heard the scream, he was very surprised, but now there is no time to look back, the old Zhou&rsquo;s roar seems to be behind him, Bai Xiaochun is sad, gritted his teeth, and roared away again.</p>
<p>In the wind blade area, fortunately, Zhou Changlao chased by and saved Lu Tianlei, who was surrounded by numerous wind blades and his clothes were all in a row. He was in a state of extreme distress. Otherwise, he would have to give up the competition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bai Xiaochun LV Tianlei&rsquo;s eyes are red, he also recognized the identity of white Xiaochun at the moment, roaring desolately!</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun didn&rsquo;t know that he unintentionally made another person hate him. He was very fast at the moment. When he ran, he rushed through one area and another of the deserted areas. After half a column of incense, he saw the end of the front from a distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going out at last!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun was excited and didn&rsquo;t notice that near the end of the place, there was a figure at the moment, walking hard step by step.</p>
<p>Shangguan Tianyou is short of breath. It&rsquo;s very easy for him all the way. Only in the last area near the end, he felt the difficulty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s forbidden spirit here In his eyes, his spiritual power was imprisoned, and more intense pressure came, as if he was carrying a mountain on his back. What&rsquo;s more amazing is that every step he takes, it seems that there is an extra mountain on his body, which is obviously only a hundred steps away, but that kind of difficulty makes his whole body tremble and is about to reach the extreme.</p>
<p>In particular, the closer he gets to the end, the greater the pressure, the more mountains he has to carry. At the moment, he seems to be only eleven steps away from the exit, but he understands that the eleven steps are more difficult than ever before.</p>
<p>Shangguan Tianyou took a deep breath and showed firmness in his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first qualification war belongs to me. My goal is to fight against Tianjiao on both sides of the Strait. As the first one in Tianjiao battle, I step into the inner gate and step into the inheritance sequence of Lingxi sect after several years!&rdquo; Shangguan Tianyou gritted his teeth and was about to step forward. Suddenly, he looked back and saw Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s him&hellip;&rdquo; For Bai Xiaochun, almost no one in the south bank did not know him. Even if he had not seen it, he went to the funeral and saw the portrait. Shangguan Tianyou was a little surprised. He thought that LV Tianlei should be the one behind him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems that my expectation of LV Tianlei is too high. It is also a waste.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shangguan Tianyou takes back his eyes. He is just a little surprised. He chooses to ignore Bai Xiaochun. In his heart, he and Bai Xiaochun are not people of the same level. After taking a step forward at the moment, Shangguan Tianyou shivers all over his body and clenchs his teeth tightly.</p>
<p>Almost at the same time that Shangguan Tianyou stepped out of this step, Bai Xiaochun had already galloped here. He didn&rsquo;t feel much when he took the first step. The second step, the third step, the fourth step</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t stop until he walked out 50 steps in a row. He looked up at the sky in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter? I feel like I&rsquo;m a little heavier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was at this time that Shangguan Tianyou&rsquo;s body trembled. This step finally fell and stood on the 90th step. If the whole person wanted to collapse and pant, he looked satisfied. He looked back and immediately saw Bai Xiaochun who had stepped into 50 steps.</p>
<p>His eyes jerked all the time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He How can he walk so fast Shangguan Tianyou&rsquo;s eyes show surprise, but then he bites his teeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It should be the cultivation of body training, so it will be faster at the beginning, but the more difficult it is later, he&hellip;&rdquo; Shangguan Tianyou&rsquo;s mind is not over, he shivers all over, staring at Bai Xiaochun running towards him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Run He Is he running? &quot; Shangguan Tianyou opened his eyes and looked at Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s rapid running there. Soon, he came to his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, why are you so slow?&rdquo; When Bai Xiaochun talks, she looks back at her back, but she doesn&rsquo;t see Zhou Changlao catching up with her. So she feels relieved and opens her mouth curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You Don&rsquo;t you think there are many mountains on your body? &quot; Shangguan Tianyou&rsquo;s eyelids are jumping, the whole person is a little confused, subconsciously asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many mountains? Well, there are some, but I don&rsquo;t feel much. &quot; White small pure one Leng, still jumped a few times, see Shangguan Tianyou eyes open boss, pour to take a breath, a face can&rsquo;t believe.</p>
<p>When Bai Xiaochun was going to continue to jump, he suddenly saw the figure of the old man chasing after him in the distance. He screamed again, and his body rushed forward. In an instant, he crossed the distance of ten steps and directly rushed out of the ancient bridge In the moment of rushing out, his speed was faster, and he ran away in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>Almost in the moment when Bai Xiaochun ran without shadow, the old steps of the perimeter in the back suddenly stopped, and his whole person was also in a daze, laughing bitterly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bai Xiaochun Did you take the first place? &quot;</p>
<p>At the same time, Zheng Yuandong, Li Qinghou and others all stood up on the high platform. They all looked strange, and the elders and others around them were also incredible. Although Bai Xiaochun had surpassed Zhou Xinqi and LV Tianlei, they had some psychological preparation, but now they are still shocked. Especially at the last pass, Bai Xiaochun actually passed it So relaxed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is First? &quot; Li Qinghou murmured.</p>
<p>Then, those standing on the high side of the disciples, also saw this scene, suddenly the sound of an uproar, roared in the valley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bai Xiaochun He surpasses Zhou Xinqi, LV Tianlei, Shangguan Tianyou, he is the first! &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God, this white Xiaochun can be the first</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bai Xiaochun can be the first. Elder Zhou plays an important role. If anyone is chased and killed like that, I&rsquo;m afraid he can take out the strength to play with his life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shangguan Tianyou looks pale all of a sudden, his mind is buzzing, and his eyes are black, as if the sky thunder rolling.</p>
<p>He looked at Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s back and saw the other party in front of him. He walked through the stone bridge, and his body gradually trembled more severely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bai Xiaochun Shangguan Tianyou&rsquo;s eyes are red, his pride, his self-esteem, and everything about him. At this moment, he only feels that he has been trampled on by Bai Xiaochun, especially when he thinks that he is still asking why he is walking so slowly.</p>
<p>Shangguan Tianyou&rsquo;s Qi and blood flow into his mind. Outside his body, the sword Qi bursts out, his eyes are red. Regardless of the distance, he rushes forward ten steps. When he passes all of them, a mouthful of blood spurts out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bai Xiaochun, I have never lost in Shangguan Tianyou. This time I don&rsquo;t accept it. In the battle of Tianjiao, I will let you know that no one can Better than me He gritted his teeth, staring at the direction of Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s departure, showing a strong sense of war in his eyes.</p>
