      <p>It has been ten days since GUI Li returned to Huqi mountain, but his biggest and only purpose has not made any progress.</p>
<p>In recent days, the Qiankun samsara plate and the Albizzia bell in Biyao&rsquo;s hands have never reacted again. Every time he tries with hope, he always gets a cold answer. And that strange underground mysterious force on that day seems to have disappeared since then, and it has never happened again.</p>
<p>Correspondingly, the atmosphere in the hall of the ghost King clan suddenly changed. In the past ten days, no one ever hurt people madly, and the speed of the expansion of the stone wall cracks suddenly stopped.</p>
<p>Everything seems to be back to the calm days of the past. Everyone gradually recovers from the edge of the cliff that is on the verge of collapse. There is a smile on people&rsquo;s faces. Although there are still words of fear and caution in the smiling faces, the atmosphere is quite different from before.</p>
<p>In the caves and passageways, more and more disciples of the ghost King clan came and went. The original appearance of people who were in the same way with each other changed completely, and they gradually talked and laughed.</p>
<p>Whether this is a coincidence or not, these changes happened just after GUI Li returned to Huqi mountain. A saying was spread among the disciples of Guiwang sect. It is said that after the vice patriarchal came back, although he did not pay any attention to the disciples below, in fact, he quickly found the source of the changes in these days and eliminated them, which led to the return of guiwangzong The hall is quiet.</p>
<p>This rumor is obviously absurd and untrue, but perhaps it is because of the miserable and dreadful life a few days ago that many disciples of the ghost King sect believed it very much, and this statement spread rapidly. As for how the GUI Li found the source of the change and how to eliminate it, the public did not know what the source of the strange change was Be clear. However, it seems that people have completely ignored these problems and just talked about them in private.</p>
<p>It is impossible for GUI Li to know these inexplicable rumors. Even if he knows it, he will not care about it at all. What he cares about is only the Biyao in the cold stone room, and the most important person to him has not improved, for himself. That&rsquo;s because the confidence that had been maintained for the first time has finally come to an end today and has been exhausted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pa!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was another gentle sound, and the bell of Albizzia once again fell on the plate of samsara and rolled slightly. He stopped quietly.</p>
<p>He looked at the jade plate in his hand and the bell in the jade plate. In his dim eyes, the last light disappeared.</p>
<p>After standing in silence for a long time, he picked up the Albizzia bell in the jade plate, went to the cold stone platform and put it in the hands of Biyao. He put her hands together on her chest with gentle movements, as if afraid that he would hurt her.</p>
<p>Then he looked at her face and whispered, &ldquo;Biyao. Sorry, I didn&rsquo;t save you</p>
<p>This heaven and earth samsara plate is the secret treasure of Tianyin temple. I have borrowed it for more than ten days, so I can&rsquo;t afford to return it. &quot;</p>
<p>At this point, his facial muscles trembled, his eyes closed, as if excited in his heart. After a long time, he slowly calmed down and said in a soft voice, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t worry. As long as I live, in any case, even if I travel all over the world, I must save you! Will you endure a little longer? &quot;</p>
<p>Biyao lies quietly in front of him. The face is still quiet expression, the corners of the mouth light with a smile, although there is no response, perhaps also in the promise of him!</p>
<p>The corners of his eyes were suddenly moist. He suddenly turned around, looked up and took a deep breath. After that little moisture dissipated, he came out slowly.</p>
<p>The heavy stone gate closed slowly behind him, and his fierce mood gradually fell to the bottom. He stood for a long time. He shook his head in silence, as if he wanted to leave something in his mind. Then he turned around and was about to leave, but suddenly he was stunned and stopped.</p>
<p>Outside the cold stone room, in front of the passage, the ghost in black stood there quietly, like a ghost without any anger. He looked at the ghost like a ghost. After a deep look at the ghost, his eyes fell into the hands of GUI Li and never left again.</p>
<p>GUI Li realized that he was in a low mood just now. He forgot to put away the Qiankun samsara plate for a moment after he came out. He took out the black cloth and wrapped it up gently and put it back in his arms. Mr. ghost looked at his movement, and did not mean to stop him, but his eyes flashed and he did not know what he was thinking.</p>
<p>Although ghost calendar is a little strange about the appearance of Mr. ghost standing there without saying a word, first, Mr. ghost usually goes through strange and mysterious things. Secondly, his mood at this time is really not asking about the meaning of other trivial matters. He is even more lazy to think about why Mr. ghost is standing here. After collecting the heaven and earth samsara plate, he even doesn&rsquo;t even bother to call on Mr. ghost. He walks and goes Passing by Mr. ghost&rsquo;s side, he walked forward without looking back.</p>
<p>Although GUI Li didn&rsquo;t want to pay attention to it, it seemed that Mr. ghost didn&rsquo;t think so. After he walked about ten steps away, Mr. ghost&rsquo;s voice suddenly came from behind. He was cold, deep but clear, and said, &ldquo;please stay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li frowned, turned around, looked at Mr. ghost, and said, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost&rsquo;s eyes twinkled and said slowly, &ldquo;is miss Biyao OK?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A flash of anger suddenly flashed on GUI Li&rsquo;s face. No one knew about the situation of Biyao. Why did Mr. GUI say this? Did he ask why he knew it, but other people would return it. GUI Li was always the most taboo about Biyao. Few of his disciples dared to speak in front of him. Over the years, Mr. GUI was the first.</p>
<p>GUI Li&rsquo;s face turned cold and his eyes were sharp. He stared at Mr. ghost and said coldly, &ldquo;what do you want to say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. GUI didn&rsquo;t seem to notice the killing intention that was looming out of GUI Li&rsquo;s body. However, he didn&rsquo;t directly answer GUI Li&rsquo;s words. Instead, he asked, &ldquo;I heard that you have found a new magic weapon to cure miss Biyao. Is it true?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not bad, but what do you ask this to do?&rdquo; he said coldly With that, he stepped forward to Mr. ghost, and his eyes were more fierce. An invisible murderous spirit was ready to move.</p>
<p>Mr. ghost still turned a blind eye to the danger coming to his face, as if he could not see that the ghost was angry at all. His nerves seemed to be completely cold, but he said faintly, &ldquo;can you lend me that treasure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His face was full of anger. The body&rsquo;s Lapel has no wind automatic, obviously has moved really angry, raises the foot to take the second step forward, but this step seems not big. However, as the figure swayed, he was three feet away from Mr. ghost. When he raised his hands and raised his feet, he could cover Mr. ghost in his own real way.</p>
<p>But this murderous atmosphere seems to be about to break out, but it is at the critical moment. Suddenly, he calmed down because of Mr. ghost&rsquo;s words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe I can do something about this magic weapon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cold ice stone chamber was originally built by the ghost king for the sake of Biyao. Since it is the place where Biyao is located and her own special circumstances, it is naturally a very quiet place in the cave of the general Hall of the ghost King clan. The ghost king has already issued strict orders, and ordinary GUI Wang sect disciples can never get close to it.</p>
<p>There are no more than five people in the Guiwang clan who can freely approach the cold stone room. GUI Li and the mysterious Mr. GUI are the candidates. At the moment, there was no one in the passage outside the cold stone room, only the two of them looked at each other.</p>
<p>His fierce eyes were still staring at the fierce anger that had just burst out on the list of Mr. ghost, but it had been slowly calmed down. After a while, he suddenly said, &ldquo;do you know this thing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ghost Mr. light way: &ldquo;just looked at in a hurry, even the magic weapon appearance also did not see clearly, I cannot say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pondered for a moment, reached into his arms and took out the heaven and earth samsara plate wrapped in black cloth, untied the black cloth, and just wanted to pass it to Mr. ghost. But suddenly there was some hesitation, the heaven and earth reincarnation plate received the hand, did not extend out.</p>
<p>Mr. ghost&rsquo;s eyes lingered on the warm jade plate for a moment, and slowly raised his eyes to the ghost. There was no talk or urge.</p>
<p>There was some hesitation in his heart. Although the mysterious Mr. ghost in front of him is said to be a member of the ghost King&rsquo;s clan at the moment, it is obvious that Gui Li has no sense of half trust in him. In the past, there was a battle between the beast God and the mysterious old man in the ancestral hall of Qingyun gate. In particular, it makes people dissatisfied and disgusted.</p>
<p>However, the mysterious figure in front of him, whether he was Taoist or knowledgeable, was something that Gui Li never dared to underestimate. After several hesitations in his heart, he finally overcame all the others with the most precious hope in the bottom of his heart. GUI Li slowly handed over the jade plate in his hand.</p>
<p>Mr. ghost didn&rsquo;t speak. He stretched out his hands and carefully took the jade plate. Holding it in front of him, he observed it carefully through the black yarn on his face.</p>
<p>On the warm jade plate, it emits soft white brilliance, such as invisible light and water, flowing slowly in the air. The patterns carved on the edge of the jade plate, some of which are primitive and powerful, some vivid and ingenious, some like the sky stars, some like mountains and rivers, which are amazing.</p>
<p>However, the most attractive place is obviously the square in the middle of the jade plate. Countless small jade blocks slide silently and never stop, but each has its own mysterious and unique track. There is no collision, which makes people dizzy and bewildering. It is faintly felt that there must be some heaven and earth truth in the operation of these countless jade blocks.</p>
<p>At the moment, the jade plate at the moment, except for the magic jade plate, there was a subtle change in the jade plate. In fact, there was a little change in the jade plate from the ghost to the jade plate Mr. a holds the wheel of heaven and earth in his hand. In the sliding of those jade blocks, there are some mysterious words on the surface of the jade blocks, which will suddenly shine for a while, and then gradually fade down.</p>
<p>There seems to be no regularity in the flash of these fonts. Only after one flash, another side lights up in another place, which is a bit more angry and mysterious than before.</p>
<p>GUI Li naturally discovered this change for a long time. In fact, this change happened after he suddenly started to use the underground monster force when he used the Qiankun samsara plate for the first time on that day. GUI Li even hoped for this change. However, no matter how he tried, he still could not understand the mysterious magic weapon.</p>
<p>Mr. ghost&rsquo;s face, hidden behind the black veil, makes people can&rsquo;t see the change of his look, and can&rsquo;t talk about guessing what he thinks in his heart, but the luster in his eyes is really more and more bright.</p>
<p>Suddenly, he felt nervous.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how long it took, Mr. ghost looked over and over this samsara plate for countless times. The vision just left the jade plate in the hand, raises the eye to see to the ghost.</p>
<p>GUI Li lowered his voice, as if he wanted to suppress his mood. His voice was low and said, &ldquo;how?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost closed his eyes and was silent for a moment. Then he said slowly, &ldquo;this magic weapon is a magic weapon on the upper part, which is called&rdquo; astrolabe &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Astrolabe?&rdquo; he said in amazement</p>
<p>Mr. ghost must have nodded.</p>
<p>GUI Li did not expect that Mr. ghost would have said such a sentence first. He was a little stunned. He was in Tianyin temple that day.</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong and master Pude made a definite statement and said it really. This magic weapon is called the heaven and earth samsara plate. Why did it become a astrolabe when it came to Mr. ghost?</p>
<p>However, GUI Li had forgotten this question for a moment. To him, whether the jade plate is the heaven and earth samsara or the astrolabe is meaningless. The most important thing is whether Mr. ghost knows the secret of the magic weapon and uses it to cure Biyao. It depends on the shape of the treasure that Mr. GUI determines. As if he had some assurance, he could not help but get excited and said in a hurry, &ldquo;well, do you know it, can it save Biyao?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost was silent for a moment. Although it was only a short time, for GUI Li, it seemed that he had spent thousands of years in torment. A heart was raised to his throat for fear that Mr. ghost would spit out a &ldquo;can&rsquo;t&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Fortunately, although Mr. ghost hesitated, he never said anything that he could not. He said slowly: &ldquo;this is an ancient artifact. It has a long history and has never appeared in the world. Although I know one or two about it, I am not sure. I&rsquo;ll try again. &quot;</p>
<p>The ghost Li&rsquo;s heart was relaxed, but he could not help but feel a little depressed. He just thought that there was only one more point of hope, and it seemed that he had not got the hope at the moment, but he was still very happy.</p>
<p>He has been in despair for too long, and a little hope may make him obsessed with it.</p>
<p>Mr. ghost pondered for a moment. To ghost Li way: &ldquo;this is not the suitable place, as we advanced the ice stone room!&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li nodded, just wanted to walk past, but hesitated for a while. Then, for the first time, he stretched out his hand to Mr. ghost, made a gesture of giving way, and said, &ldquo;Sir, please go in first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li was arrogant in the ghost King clan since he came. Even when he was facing the ghost king, he was rarely courteous. This time he made an attitude towards the ghost master who had never had a good impression. This shows how important Biyao is in his heart. Mr. ghost seemed to be a little surprised for a moment, but he looked at him casually, nodded, and walked over. Ghost Li followed him, and they entered the ice stone room again.</p>
<p>In the stone chamber, Biyao is still lying on the stone platform just as before. It is quiet and beautiful. The light white cold air is floating from the cold stone platform and diffuses in the air.</p>
<p>GUI Li walks to Biyao and just wants to take out the Albizzia bell from her hand. Suddenly listen to the ghost Mr. way behind: &ldquo;wait a moment to take that joyous bell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li was stunned and turned to look at Mr. ghost. He said, &ldquo;the soul of Biyao is locked in the bell of Albizzia. If you don&rsquo;t take it, how can you treat it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost shook his head and said, &ldquo;as I said just now, the astrolabe is an ancient magic weapon. I only know a little about it. I can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m sure. Before I try, I still don&rsquo;t disturb miss Biyao&rsquo;s joyous bell. It&rsquo;s not too late to perform the magic after mastering it. At least, we should protect the soul of miss Biyao.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He woke up, nodded again and again, and said, &ldquo;what you said, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the moment, Mr. ghost, holding a jade plate, sat down on the other side of the stone chamber. GUI Li also went to the opposite side of Mr. ghost and sat down, staring at him closely. Although the sudden appearance of Mr. ghost brought a hope, GUI Li still didn&rsquo;t fully believe in him in his heart. Although he was polite, he had to guard against him in any case.</p>
<p>Mr. ghost slowly placed the jade plate on the ground in front of him. He closed his eyes and meditated. It seemed that some doubts still lingered in his mind. After a long time, he opened his eyes, and then slowly extended his right index finger to the jade plate in front of him.</p>
<p>His face moved, and then he was patient again. His eyes showed a little nervous. Looking at Mr. ghost&rsquo;s face, although he could not see his expression, it was not easy to see him staring at the jade plate without blinking.</p>
<p>Mr. ghost&rsquo;s index finger soon approached the jade plate. He stopped at a place five inches high from the jade plate. Under his finger, there was still no change on the jade plate, in the soft white light. Countless small pieces of jade are still automatically gliding along their own tracks, and some of the words are shining quietly.</p>
<p>Mr. ghost just stretched out his hand and stopped motionless in the air. His eyes were staring at the jade plate. It seems that he is looking for something. Although he is puzzled, he dare not disturb him at the moment. Only the ghost Mr. so dry wait for a small half cup of tea time, suddenly a light drink, that has been stopped in the top of the jade plate finger. As if the sky over a flash like piercing the sky, toward the jade plate pressed down.</p>
<p>With a slight dull sound, there was a piece of jade sliding in the middle of the jade plate, and the font on it had just lit up. At the moment when it was going to be dark, Mr. ghost&rsquo;s finger just pressed the jade block.</p>
<p>Calm jade plate, suddenly issued a hundred times more brilliant than before!</p>
<p>At the same time, there was such an illusion that the world outside him suddenly slowed down in such an instant, and the stone chamber where he lived was. It also seems to be a hundred times wider than the impression, he is like an ant, facing the endless unknown world.</p>
<p>The strange illusion passed in a twinkling of an eye, but it had already made the ghost fierce involuntarily. His hands were full of cold sweat. However, he could not think much about it at the moment. Once he regained his mind, his first reaction was to look at the jade plate. Just before the meeting, more and more dazzling light bloomed on the jade plate, and there was a gentle &ldquo;Pa Pa Pa&rdquo; sound coming from the depth of the brilliance. Presumably, it was because Mr. ghost&rsquo;s fingers destroyed the sliding track of those jade blocks in the jade plate. The reason why more and more jade pieces collide with each other.</p>
<p>As the sound of the crackling gradually became louder and louder, the brilliance of the jade plate was more and more dazzling. In a flash, the whole cold stone room had been filled, and the ghost could not even see the figure of Mr. ghost on the opposite side. In front of this sudden mysterious brilliance, he was surprised and pleased.</p>
<p>The dazzling light is still increasing, as if the small sun fell into this stone chamber, but the ghost didn&rsquo;t feel the slightest burning feeling. Instead, there was a kind of deep and subtle sound in the thousands of lights. Such as incantations, such as chanting, like the wind howling in the mountains, like the birds singing in the valley.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, at this tense and strange time, my heart suddenly jumped and my whole body was shocked. It seemed that the circulation of blood all over the body stopped for a moment. The whole person was dizzy and almost fainted.</p>
<p>He was startled, and did not wait for him to respond. Among the brilliant brilliance and mysterious incantation, his hands and palms, the spring under his feet, the elixir field between his abdomen and the top of his head were the most sensitive gathering points of his whole body. At the same time, the Qi and blood of his whole body were surging, and the blood was pouring back into his body, which was as painful as a knife. With his tenacity, he could not help humming Sound, full of pain.</p>
<p>Behind the brilliance on the front, Mr. ghost seemed to feel something and asked, &ldquo;how?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Listening to his voice, he seemed to be completely unaffected, and he was really surprised. He had never met such a situation before. If it was said that the Demon power of &ldquo;blood sucking beads&rdquo; was counteracting, it was obviously different from the previous attack. Moreover, since the fourth volume of the book of heaven, the Demon power of blood sucking beads has been fully integrated and never happened again, let alone this The Dementor who carved the blood bead was lying quietly in his arms, motionless. If you like this book, please vote for me in Liancheng Book League</p>
<p>However, the pain of his body was increasing. After a moment, the blood vessels of his whole body vibrated more violently, almost convulsed, and his limbs gradually numb. Just now, the vibration of his whole body, such as palms and Dantian, moved rapidly, moving rapidly from all sides of his body, but all of them moved to the middle of the fierce brow.</p>
<p>This strange change is so fast that people can&rsquo;t imagine it. GUI Li&rsquo;s whole body is shaking violently. Fortunately, there is a dazzling light blocking him at the moment. Mr. ghost doesn&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going on. However, with Mr. ghost&rsquo;s deeds, he feels that something has changed greatly here. In the vague and hard flickering, the black figure of Mr. ghost seems to stand up suddenly.</p>
<p>GUI li felt that his whole body was as painful as a knife, but he didn&rsquo;t know why he left. At this painful moment, the shock from all over his body had already gathered in the middle of his brow. In a flash, he seemed to hear a music burst from his own skull, just like an explosion, which made his eyebrows burst It exploded.</p>
<p>And a sharp beam of light, like a sharp dagger, was inserted into his forehead and penetrated his head!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a moment. He almost lost his mind, but he had always been patient and resolute. Over the years, he had developed an indomitable tenacity and even survived. Then, in the interval of pain, he realized that his head was safe and sound, and there was no scene of explosion in his imagination. But the illusion just now was so real.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s terrible!</p>
<p>At this moment, the ghost&rsquo;s voice suddenly came: &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>With Mr. ghost&rsquo;s words coming, GUI Li suddenly felt relaxed, the strange pressure receded like the tide, and the brilliant light in the cold stone room also quickly faded. He took a deep breath, calmed down, and looked forward, only to see Mr. ghost stand up and look at the ghost. And his finger, also naturally left that jade plate.</p>
<p>After losing Mr. ghost&rsquo;s finger pressing, the jade blocks in the center of the jade plate all resumed their original track sliding again, and the jade plate also returned to its original state. GUI Li was silent for a moment under the gaze of Mr. ghost. Then his face slowly calmed down. He said faintly: &ldquo;nothing. The light was too dazzling just now. I just reached out to cover it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost was stunned and frowned. He would not believe that Gui Li would be afraid of the white light. He just saw the expression of GUI Li and didn&rsquo;t tell him what he meant. He murmured for a moment. He sat back again.</p>
<p>GUI Li took a look at him and said, &ldquo;how do you treat the heaven and earth How does this chart know? It&rsquo;s possible to cast a spell? &quot;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost nodded, but the look on his face seemed strange. He was about to speak. Suddenly at this moment, GUI Li and Mr. ghost changed their faces at the same time and felt something.</p>
<p>At the next moment, the whole cold stone chamber was shaking violently. Then, a strange and strong bloody gas suddenly blew out and became thick, which covered all places. On the hard stone walls around, the startling sound of &ldquo;Pa Pa Pa Pa Pa Pa Pa Pa Pa&rdquo; continuously issued. Those original cracks suddenly expanded again, and countless large and small stones were shaken down from the stone wall.</p>
<p>The ground vibrated more and more violently. Perhaps because of the wall rupture, the sound insulation effect of the cold stone room was not as good as before. We could hear the desperate and crazy cry in the distance. In the smell of blood, Mr. ghost and GUI Li changed their faces again.</p>
<p>At this moment, the mysterious and strange force, which had been quiet for ten days, was awakened again. The surrounding stone walls and the ground vibrated more and more fiercely. This time, it seemed that this strange force had a particularly fierce attack and had no stopping momentum. GUI Li swept to the side of the cold stone platform, guarding the body of Biyao. Mr. ghost looked around, frowned, silent, as if he was thinking about something, and his face was also a little suspicious.</p>
<p>The roars and shrieks from the distance came one after another. It seems that the outside has fallen back into the previous fear and madness. The cracks in the wall are still slowly expanding. The falling stones in the ground are shaking constantly, which makes them feel particularly thrilling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boom</p>
<p>Suddenly, there was a loud noise, but it came from the stone gate at the entrance of the stone chamber. The huge rock was shaken and scattered on the ground. Among the rocks flying with debris, a figure quickly and incomparably swept in, and his face was full of anxiety. It was the ghost king.</p>
<p>As soon as the ghost King entered the stone chamber, he looked at the stone platform, and saw that Gui Li was already guarding the side of Biyao. Although there was a strong earthquake on the left and right, and there were no stones falling on the top of the stone chamber, all the stones falling within the scope of the cold stone platform were shaken out by him.</p>
<p>The ghost King took a breath and felt at ease, but his face was not relaxed. Then he turned his eyes and saw that Mr. ghost was on the other side of the stone chamber. He could not help frowning and said to Mr. ghost, &ldquo;what are you doing here? Don&rsquo;t you go&hellip;&rdquo;?</p>
<p>In the middle of the speech, the ghost king suddenly stopped talking. However, Mr. ghost seemed to understand and nodded. His body moved, as if he wanted to leave. But suddenly he remembered something and turned his eyes to the ground. He saw that the jade plate, which did not know whether it should be called the astrolabe or the samsara of heaven and earth, was lying on the ground quietly. Mr. ghost took a step towards the jade plate. Suddenly he felt a sharp look from behind. It was extremely cold. He slowly returned to his head. However, he hit a fallen stone with his hands, but his eyes were staring at him.</p>
<p>Mr. ghost was silent for a moment. He did not go forward again. Then he swept out of the stone chamber. The black figure flashed like a ghost, and he could not see a human figure any more.</p>
<p>At the moment, there are only GUI Li and GUI Wang in the stone chamber. The ghost King glances at the jade plate on the ground. Looking at the ghost, he was silent for a moment, but he sighed softly. No matter why Mr. ghost is here. However, GUI Li came to the cold stone room with the jade plate. Naturally, he wanted to cure Biyao. Now, he didn&rsquo;t need to ask about her appearance and knew that she didn&rsquo;t improve at all.</p>
<p>The ghost King walked to the other side of the ice stone platform in silence. A rock on top of him could not hang in the strong vibration and fell down. The ghost King gently waved his hand. If the rock was hit hard, it flew out in mid air, and the sound of &ldquo;boom&rdquo; rushed to the nearby stone wall and smashed into pieces.</p>
<p>GUI Li looked at the ghost king and didn&rsquo;t speak. The two men stood beside the quiet sleeping woman in silence, guarding her patiently and comprehensively. Biyao&rsquo;s face is still with a faint smile, perhaps in her heart, but also some happy bar!</p>
<p>After half a cup of tea time, but this strange earthquake has not stopped. On the contrary, the mysterious power with a thick bloody smell galloped underground. The king of ghosts and the ghost Li were both extremely high. They both obviously arrived at this force. This force was not an ordinary earthquake, but a spiritual one. It felt like a trapped beast, roaring furiously to break away from the shackles and chains of his body. Therefore, even if the heaven and earth were destroyed, they did not care at all.</p>
<p>Outside the stone chamber, because the stone gate was destroyed by the ghost king. In the distance, the crazy roar and more and more frequent shrieks from the disciples of the ghost King clan became louder and sharper. The ghost King&rsquo;s Application on his face became more and more irritable, and his anger gradually rose to his face. He stood aside and felt that the ghost King&rsquo;s mood had changed. I thought he had a look there, but I was shocked in my heart.</p>
<p>Only the muscles on the ghost King&rsquo;s face were slightly twisted and looked ferocious, which was quite different from his usual bearing. In his eyes, a layer of dark red color suddenly floated on his eyes. Such as light red light flow in the orbit.</p>
<p>GUI Li&rsquo;s heart moved, but the ghost king just looked over. Their eyes met. The ghost king suddenly sneered, his voice was cold, and he said, &ldquo;what are you looking at?&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li met his eyes, did not shrink back, as indifferent mouth: &ldquo;nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost King&rsquo;s eyes were frozen, his eyes were cold, and he was staring at the ghost. Originally, the relaxed atmosphere between the two people suddenly became a little tense. However, at this moment, after a strong vibration, the two parties felt that the mysterious power at their feet suddenly declined.</p>
<p>Sure enough, after a moment, the vibration of the ground and the surrounding stone walls stopped quickly. The stones falling like a light rain finally stopped, and the strange bloody air in the air also quietly dissipated. GUI Li gently took a breath and looked at the cold stone platform. She saw Biyao lying there safe and sound, sleeping quietly with a smile.</p>
<p>Later, GUI Li turned his head to the ghost king. However, the ghost king also looked at Biyao silently. The anger on his face and the faint murderous spirit just now disappeared. In this world, perhaps only when he gazed at the only beloved daughter, could the ghost King wake up from his anger and calm down.</p>
<p>The ghost king looked at Biyao for a long time. His eyes were full of love. Then he slowly moved away from his eyes and said in a low voice, &ldquo;take care of her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; he said</p>
<p>As soon as the ghost king turned around, he strode out and soon disappeared. The ghost stood for a moment. The rest of his eyes swept across the ground, but he saw that jade plate was still lying on the ground. Just now there were falling stones, but it was strange that no stone hit the jade plate.</p>
<p>Ghost Li walked over, picked up the jade plate from the ground, looked at it carefully for a while, took out the black cloth bag from the bosom, and put it back in the arms. Outside the stone chamber, the distant roar gradually subsided. However, after the disaster, the noise still kept rising. Obviously, many people did not wake up from the previous fear.</p>
<p>GUI Li frowned, and his eyes slowly fell on the broken scene around him. After this severe destruction, the stone chamber with cracks was even more scarred. What is different from the previous time is that not only the surrounding stone walls are seriously damaged, but also the ground on which the feet are treaded, there are already quite large cracks appearing, and some places are pulled out to a great depth Pit.</p>
<p>The cold stone room was still so badly damaged. It can be imagined that the outer passage and the place where the disciples of the ghost King clan lived in the distance were miserable. It seems that this is the best explanation for this.</p>
<p>His eyes gradually became sharp. He went to a crack in the stone wall and looked at it silently but carefully. Then, with his brow locked, he put out another hand and groped up and down the rough gap. The small stone fell with the movement of his palm, fell to the ground, bounced a few times, and rolled to the corner. GUI Li slowly retracted his arm, and then made a strange move. Put the palm of your hand in front of your nose and sniff it gently, as if you are smelling something peculiar.</p>
<p>His eyes were sharper and brighter.</p>
<p>This strange force appeared twice after he returned to Huqi mountain, but both happened to encounter him treating Biyao with Qiankun samsara plate. It&rsquo;s impossible to say that it has nothing to do with it. Since it is related to his most important treatment of Biyao, he can no longer stay away from it.</p>
<p>Deep in the cave, blood pool.</p>
<p>The strange power of the fierce four spirits blood array has calmed down. Although the blood pool is still filled with a strong smell of blood, the aura emanating from the Fulong tripod has no big fluctuation.</p>
<p>Mr. ghost stood alone on the platform and looked up at the Fulong Ding suspended in the air. In the red light flashing all over the sky, his eyes were firmly fixed on the white light column between the devil&rsquo;s face and forehead on the ancient Ding.</p>
<p>The white light column, shaped like a sharp light dagger, was much brighter than he had seen before. The diameter also seems to be thicker by a circle. The devil&rsquo;s face was even more distorted. The bloody red mansions, which had been almost completely red, had been pushed back to the second half. It seems that even the red color has been darkened at the moment, and there is a feeling that it can not be maintained.</p>
<p>But Mr. ghost looked at the situation, but his eyes did not have the anxiety and urgency before. Instead, he was more of a joy. After a long time, he only heard a low smile and said: &ldquo;sure enough. Indeed, it has something to do with the astrolabe&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>He moved forward and stopped at the end of the platform, then leaned out to look down at the blood pool. The four giant spirit beasts at the bottom were soaked in blood and water, all of them were weak and exhausted. It was obvious that the real yuan spirit of these ancient spirit beasts had been completely absorbed by the strange four spirit blood array set by Mr. GUI.</p>
<p>Around the Fulong tripod above, the aura is abundant and abnormal, turning into red light and flying around the Fulong Ding. The Fulong tripod also flickered with light, as if echoing these auras. However, at the most important throat, the light dagger on the devil&rsquo;s face blocked the Qi channel, making it impossible for the surrounding aura to infuse into the Fulong tripod, making the blood array difficult.</p>
<p>Mr. ghost looked at this kind of vision, and his eyes narrowed slightly behind the black veil. His eyes showed the color of contemplation. Seeing his palms clasped and tapping unconsciously, he was obviously thinking about something in his mind.</p>
<p>It was at this moment that the voice of breaking the skirt suddenly came from the back of the blood pool platform. Mr. ghost felt it immediately and turned around to see the ghost King come over with a gloomy face.</p>
<p>In front of him, the ghost king didn&rsquo;t want to be polite, so he directly asked Mr. ghost, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter? How can this blood array power be so out of control?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost slowly looked at the light dagger on the Fulong tripod above, and said: &ldquo;this earthquake is the Shura power of the four spirits blood array. It has its own spirit. It wants to break away from the shackles of the divine law and heaven and earth, and struggles hard. During this time, the fierce and fierce blood and the spirit of the giant beast absorbed by the blood array are aroused. The three forces attack, which leads to this earth moving mountain It&rsquo;s a swagger. &quot;</p>
<p>The ghost King snorted coldly and looked at the top of his head. He said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s very nice. How could the earth shake? But there&rsquo;s no way to take a small light column.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost said lightly: &ldquo;if the prohibition of ancient divine law is so easy, it will not be the ancient divine law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost King&rsquo;s anger flashed on his face and said coldly, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to hear so much. Do you have any way to get rid of this bullshit lock?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost was silent for a moment, and then he laughed in a low voice. He said, &ldquo;it was very difficult, but now,&rdquo; he slowly looked up at the ghost king and said, &ldquo;there is a way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost king was surprised and said in dismay, &ldquo;what, have you found a way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost nodded slowly, but did not directly say what method was. Instead, he turned around and looked at the quaint Fulong Ding floating in the air above his head. After gazing for a long time, he gently said, &ldquo;you can bear with it for a while. When you are born, it will not be too far away&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the middle of the sky, the red light on the Fulong tripod flickers ceaselessly, but it seems that it is also spiritual in general, silently watching the people who go down.</p>
<p>In the cave of guiwangzong, it is a mess. The earthquake this time was much stronger than before, and the strange and mysterious power seemed to be even more terrible. More than ten disciples of guiwangzong were crazy at the same time. Although these crazy disciples were still killed one by one under the siege of awakened people, there were more than dozens of casualties. What&rsquo;s more, these dead people, whether they are mad or killed in battle, are their daily companions. Many of them even fought together to defend the enemy or talk to each other at the first moment. At the next moment, they have become enemies of life and death. (to be continued. )</p>
