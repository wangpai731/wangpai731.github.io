      <p>When the atmosphere began, it seemed a little depressed. Tian could not slowly straighten his body. His face was cloudy and clear, and he could not see what he was thinking.</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai was silent for a while and said, &ldquo;Uncle Tian, I&rsquo;ve been hesitating about this for a long time, but I can&rsquo;t keep it from you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian could not breathe deeply and nodded, &ldquo;I know what you mean, nephew Xiao. Thank you very much. &quot;</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai nodded, as if thinking of something, and said, &ldquo;Uncle Tian, although I see that younger martial brother Zhang knows the father and daughter of the ghost king, he doesn&rsquo;t seem to have entered the evil way yet. It&rsquo;s just that the people in the demon sect are sinister and poisonous. Younger martial brother Zhang is afraid that he may be in some danger. &quot;</p>
<p>Tian was not easy to hum, his face was frosty, and he said coldly, &ldquo;that beast, see how I can teach him back! &quot;</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai took a look at him and said, &ldquo;Uncle Tian, I have a word. I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The field is not easy, &ldquo;you say. &quot;</p>
<p>Xiao Yi said, &ldquo;yes. Uncle Tian, the reason why I tell you about brother Zhang in private is that I hope you can deal with it well before it gets too big. Uncle Cangsong has always been in charge of the punishment of Qingyun. He has a strong temperament. If he knows it, he is afraid of younger martial brother Zhang. He is your disciple after all, and you must have spent a lot of effort on him over the years. If you really want to make a big trouble, you and uncle Cangsong are not good to see. So he lowered his voice and said, &ldquo;if younger martial brother Zhang has not made any big mistake, you should teach him in private. &quot;</p>
<p>Tian can&rsquo;t easily look up and take a deep look at him. Suddenly, he said, &ldquo;martial nephew Xiao, you really have the wind of a general, and you don&rsquo;t need to be valued so much by the headmaster and elder martial brother. It seems that you are the leader in the future. &quot;</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai lowered his head slightly and said, &ldquo;Uncle Tian, you are flattered. &quot;</p>
<p>Tian is not easy at the moment, his face is as usual, and he says with a light smile, &ldquo;OK! You should have a rest soon! I will remember your kindness this time. &quot;</p>
<p>He did not know whether or not, in the &ldquo;bamboo peak&rdquo; on the three words, accentuated the tone.</p>
<p>However, Xiao Yicai could not understand anything. He smiled and said, &ldquo;martial uncle, you are welcome. &quot;</p>
<p>Tian nods. Stand up and walk out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not easy for Tian to stand alone in a secluded place in the woods and stand with his hand in his hand.</p>
<p>At this time, it was already deep in the night. The sky was full of stars and the moon was high. The bright moonlight shone through the luxuriant branches and leaves of the forest and fell on him.</p>
<p>Seeing from the darkness, his brow was slightly wrinkled, obviously he was thinking about something.</p>
<p>Just then. There was a sudden sound of footsteps behind.</p>
<p>It was not easy for Tian to turn around and look back. Suddenly, he was shocked and said, &ldquo;is it milk? &quot;</p>
<p>It was his wife, Su Ru. Only in this bleak night, in the silent forest, she came quietly, as if in an instant, all eyes were on her.</p>
<p>As if, so many years, has not erased her half of the beauty.</p>
<p>Su Ru approaches and looks at Tian hard. With a smile on the corner of his mouth, he said, &ldquo;you just asked Daren to come back and ask Xiaofan to come here. Xiaofan was not here. I asked him to go to the King Kong gate and look at him. He should be here soon. &quot;</p>
<p>Tian nods and looks at Su Ru. He seems to want to say something, but he doesn&rsquo;t say anything.</p>
<p>Su Ru said lightly, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve seen Xiao Yicai since late, and you&rsquo;ve been frowning since you came back. What&rsquo;s the matter? &quot;</p>
<p>Tian is not easy to grow a breath. His face relaxed a little, and he said with a smile, &ldquo;I know I can&rsquo;t hide it from you. &ldquo;Then he told Xiao Yicai about Zhang Xiaofan.</p>
<p>Su Ru listened in silence. After pondering for a while, he shook his head and said, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s not say whether Xiao Fan knew the devil king and his daughter, but even if they knew each other, we can say that Xiao Fan had joined the devil cult, or even that he was the spy of the devil cult who infiltrated the Qingyun sect. I don&rsquo;t believe it. &quot;</p>
<p>Tian doesn&rsquo;t sing easily. He said, &ldquo;I know this without milk. Hey, I used to take six apprentices. From the eldest to the sixth, none of them would cause trouble and make me so upset! &quot;</p>
<p>Su Ru took a look at him and said with a smile, &ldquo;but there is no one like him from the eldest to the sixth, who will show you his face on the seven pulse test! &quot;</p>
<p>The field was not easy to smother for a while, but his mouth refused to admit defeat. His eyes turned white and he said, &ldquo;is that also face? It was thundered like a burnt stone. &quot;</p>
<p>Su Ru laughed and said, &ldquo;ah! My elder martial brother Tian, it&rsquo;s said that 300 years ago, when you took part in the martial arts test of Qimai club, you were only in the top four! &quot;</p>
<p>Tian was not easy to be turned over by his wife. He was embarrassed. He said, &ldquo;well, I didn&rsquo;t even think about it at that time. The night before the test, I ran to find milk. I sneaked out with milk and watched the stars and the moon on the Hongqiao bridge of Tongtian peak. I didn&rsquo;t sleep all night.</p>
<p>When it comes to the competition, there is no spirit at all. Where is brother Wan&rsquo;s opponent? &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bah! &ldquo;Su Ru spat at him, but there was a faint blush on her face. Looking at her tenderness, she seemed to return to the night when she was young.&rdquo; elder martial brother Wan is extremely talented and intelligent. Among the disciples of our generation, there is no one like him in the cultivation of Taoism except the leader and elder martial brother daoxuan. What are you? When you were in the top four, your master couldn&rsquo;t even close his mouth. Did you want to defeat senior brother Wan? &quot;</p>
<p>Tian was not easy to laugh, but he was obviously in a better mood. He said, &ldquo;naturally, senior brother Wan is much better than me, but Nai chose me between him and me in that year, so I still have something better than him. &quot;</p>
<p>Su Ru took a white look at him and said, &ldquo;I followed you when I lost my mind and my eyes. &quot;</p>
<p>Tian was not easy to listen to or angry. He just looked at his wife and laughed. His eyes were full of laughter. Suddenly, he reached out and held Su Ru&rsquo;s soft and boneless hand.</p>
<p>Su Ru glared at him and whispered, &ldquo;what are you doing at such an old age? Besides, after a while, Xiaofan is coming. What does it look like when he sees it! &quot;</p>
<p>Tian is not easy, but she doesn&rsquo;t laugh. Su Ru lowers her head slightly, but she doesn&rsquo;t pull her hand back.</p>
<p>The night is like water, no one is around. The cool evening wind blows quietly, moving the treetop branches in the night.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s quiet in the woods.</p>
<p>For a while, Su Ru suddenly said, &ldquo;actually, I think Xiaofan looks like you. &ldquo;Then she looked up and said to Tian,&rdquo; do you feel it? &quot;</p>
<p>Tian was not easily shocked for a moment, and said, &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t it? &quot;</p>
<p>Su Ru smiled and said, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s your expression? In fact, you seemed to be stupid at that time. No one thought that you were inferior to those high spirited senior brothers and younger brothers. But in the end, in your Dazhu peak. You are the greatest achiever and the highest Taoist. Your master later passed on the first place to you. &quot;</p>
<p>Tian could not easily hum and said, &ldquo;my name is introvert, which is not stupid. &quot;</p>
<p>Su Ru burst out laughing. Shaking his head and laughing, &ldquo;you are a man! I&rsquo;m old and have a lot of cheek. I can&rsquo;t help you. After a pause, she continued, &ldquo;but when it comes to Xiaofan, I don&rsquo;t believe you didn&rsquo;t see it. With his performance in the past one or two years, even though he is not as intelligent as Lin Jingyu and Lu Xueqi, he can not be said to be a fool. I think he is at least above the average.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that in the first few years, I was left out by you, and I felt a little inferiority in my heart. It seems that I was a little bit wooden. &quot;</p>
<p>When it came to this, Su Ru seemed to have thought of something again. After a moment of silence, she said, &ldquo;but what I can&rsquo;t think of all the time is. How could it take him three times more time to complete the first level of Taiji Xuanqing Taoism? &quot;</p>
<p>Tian could not easily shake his head, spit out a sullen breath in his chest, and said lightly, &ldquo;now I don&rsquo;t need to think about that much. When the old seven comes, I will naturally ask him what he has done these days? What else have we done that we don&rsquo;t know? &quot;</p>
<p>Su Ru took a look at him and said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t wait for a moment for him to look vicious again. He hasn&rsquo;t spoken yet. Then I was so scared that I couldn&rsquo;t speak. &quot;</p>
<p>Tian could not easily hum and said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how. Sometimes when I look at him like that, I feel a rush of anger. &quot;</p>
<p>Su Ru smiled and said, &ldquo;in fact, you don&rsquo;t want to make your most promising disciple better. Not only in Taoism, but also in daily life. You also want him to be like Qi Hao and Xiao Yicai. He will find the right and the left. In the future, &ldquo;Su Ru sighed. Stop talking.</p>
<p>It was not easy for Tian to pause for a moment and say, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter? &quot;</p>
<p>Su Ru looked at him and hesitated for a moment, then said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not easy. After so many years of your temperament, I haven&rsquo;t seen you change like senior brother Wan, so&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian was not easy to be silent for a while and nodded slowly, &ldquo;I know what you mean, needless to say. &quot;</p>
<p>Su Ru looked at him for a long time, and suddenly smiled, &ldquo;if Xiao Fan knew that he always looked down upon his master and expected the most from him, he would not know how happy he would be? &quot;</p>
<p>Tian could not easily Snort and turned around with a disdain on his face, saying, &ldquo;just his stupid appearance, let me expect the most from him? Stop dreaming! &quot;</p>
<p>Su Ru is behind him, looking at him with a smile, feeling his palm still holding his hand, warm and generous, as if the three hundred years have not changed at all.</p>
<p>Quietly, she also clenched his hand.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan and song Daren left the place where Shitou and his Shifu dalizun lived, and came back. It seemed that they were still echoing the roaring laughter of Shitou. All the way up, but it was getting dark. Except for a few night watchers, everyone slowly walked back to their quarters.</p>
<p>Seeing that he was about to arrive at the cave where Dazhu peak lived, song Daren felt uneasy and turned to Zhang Xiaofan and said, &ldquo;Xiaofan, did you remember what I said to you just now? &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan said, &ldquo;yes, elder martial brother. &quot;</p>
<p>Song Daren nodded and said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what Shifu is looking for you for, but I see that he has been frowning since he came back from senior brother Xiao Yicai, for fear of something unpleasant. &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was silent, and he was more uneasy. I wonder if Xiao Yi had just told her about the ghost king and Baguio that day. If so, he would not know how to explain when he asked.</p>
<p>Seeing that Zhang Xiaofan didn&rsquo;t speak, song Daren thought he was afraid, so he smiled and patted him on the shoulder, saying, &ldquo;Xiaofan, you don&rsquo;t have to worry too much. Although Shifu is usually severe, he loves our brothers very much. &ldquo;At this point, he paused, lowered his voice, and said,&rdquo; but don&rsquo;t be impulsive any more. If you contradict master, we can&rsquo;t plead for you! &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan felt warm, bit his teeth, looked at Song Daren, and said in a low voice, &ldquo;elder martial brother, I, I did that to you a few days ago. It&rsquo;s really wrong. You, don&rsquo;t blame me! &quot;</p>
<p>Song Daren laughs. Reaching out and touching his head, he smiled, &ldquo;what are you doing? Hurry up. Don&rsquo;t let Shifu wait long. But this day is really, just now the moon is still hanging high. Why is it just for a moment? The dark clouds come over. East China Sea here, after all, is different from our Central Plains. &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan looked up at the sky, and sure enough, it seemed that the sky was suddenly dark, and the moon was still bright. Now only in the gradual accumulation of black clouds shuttle, light greatly weakened, see people feel bored.</p>
<p>Speaking, the two of them have come back. Song Daren and Zhang Xiaofan stop, only to hear Tian ling&rsquo;er and Du Bishu laughing in the cave.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was silent for a moment and said to song Daren, &ldquo;elder martial brother, I will not go in, but go to the woods to find my master. &quot;</p>
<p>Song Daren looks at him and nods. He said, &ldquo;well, hurry up! But now it&rsquo;s dark. You should be careful when you walk in the woods, you know? &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan smiled, nodded and walked to the forest.</p>
<p>Looking at his back, song Daren suddenly felt that the younger martial brother was a little lonely. He sighed, shook his head, and turned back to the cave.</p>
<p>A walk into the forest. Darkness seemed to come from the depths of the forest and surround him.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan pauses for a moment, his heart moving. But after a while, the eyes gradually adapted to the environment in the forest. The residual moonlight above the night sky also sprinkled down through the thick branches and leaves, falling on nobody&rsquo;s place, with a faint light.</p>
<p>Everything in the forest is quiet. There is no birdsong in the daytime. Without the breath of wild animals, even the usual low chirp of insects can be heard everywhere. In this night, it seems that we can&rsquo;t hear it. There are big and towering trees everywhere, towering and upright, like silent soldiers in the dark!</p>
<p>Only the wind!</p>
<p>The sea breeze from the deep sea far away blows over the top of the forest, moving the treetops and rustling.</p>
<p>In the dark and deep forest, young people walk alone.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s thoughts suddenly drifted away. In this deep forest and silent night, he suddenly recalled the past for a long time: he was a child under the dim light, nestled in his mother&rsquo;s arms, stared at the night outside, and had a slight fear</p>
<p>Originally, inadvertently, that period of past years, has been so far away.</p>
<p>He closed his eyes, took a deep breath, shook his head, quickened his pace, and walked on.</p>
<p>However, he did not find that on his way, in the dark depths, two red lights suddenly lit up silently, like the flame of hatred.</p>
<p>Like a person, angry eyes!</p>
<p>Tian was not easy to frown. He was impatient and said, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter? I haven&rsquo;t come for so long? &quot;</p>
<p>Su Ru took a look at him and said, &ldquo;how can you be so quick? Daren runs to find him. He comes back from the great Reverend. Even if he runs, it will take a while. You can&rsquo;t let him fly in the clouds for this, can you? &quot;</p>
<p>Tian Nan Yi snorted, looked up at the sky and said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s strange how the sky changes so fast in the East China Sea? &quot;</p>
<p>Su Ru looked around and frowned slightly. &ldquo;Yes! It&rsquo;s still bright just now! In a twinkling of an eye, the clouds covered the top. But she didn&rsquo;t take this to heart. As soon as the topic turned around, she asked another thing, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not easy. I&rsquo;ve been puzzled about one thing since just now.</p>
<p>&quot;</p>
<p>It was not easy for Tian to look at her and say, &ldquo;what? &quot;</p>
<p>Su Ru said, &ldquo;if Xiaofan is really like Xiao Yicai&rsquo;s saying that he knows the ghost King&rsquo;s father and daughter, and is sensible, he should be right with senior brother Cangsong. He should be very clear about this. But he told you in private that he was against elder martial brother Cangsong&rsquo;s deceit. He was not familiar with dazhufeng. I always felt something was wrong. &quot;</p>
<p>Tian was not easy to silence for a moment, and said lightly, &ldquo;this man is not simple. &quot;</p>
<p>Su Ru frowned slightly and said, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter? &quot;</p>
<p>Tian not easy didn&rsquo;t answer her directly, but pondered for a while, saying, &ldquo;as far as I know, the leader and senior brother have been paying attention to the Tao all these years, and the things in the gate have been gradually ignored. Most of the trivial things in daily life are handed over to the elders headed by Cangsong. At this point, he paused, sneered and said, &ldquo;now there is a private discussion in the door. Cangsong is the leader who lives in longshoufeng. &quot;</p>
<p>As soon as Su Ru was shaken, she had a worried look on her face. She pulled the hard sleeve of lattan and whispered, &ldquo;you mustn&rsquo;t talk nonsense outside. &quot;</p>
<p>Tian uneasily nodded and said, &ldquo;naturally, I understand. Don&rsquo;t worry! &quot;</p>
<p>After that, he pondered for a while and said, &ldquo;milk also knows that in the past two thousand years of Qingyun sect, especially since the founder of Qingyu created the seven veins of Qingyun, the leader&rsquo;s position has always been taken over by the disciples of Tongtian peak of changmen. But now &quot;</p>
<p>Su Ru smiled and then said, &ldquo;but now, elder martial brother Cangsong is highly respected in the door, has strong Taoist skills, and is only second to elder martial brother daoxuan in reputation. It seemed that Xiao Yicai had no objection when he took over the post. Now it seems that he has some doubts. &quot;</p>
<p>Tian was not easy to say lightly, &ldquo;and in the past 200 years, Cangsong has been in charge of the punishment of Qingyun sect. It&rsquo;s a common saying. Except for senior brother daoxuan, he has not paid attention to anyone for a long time. Nephew Xiao has some worries, which is normal. &quot;</p>
<p>Su Ru lowered her head and said for a long time, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not easy. There&rsquo;s a big dispute between the leaders. Don&rsquo;t get too involved. &quot;</p>
<p>It was not easy for Tian to shake his head and say, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, but I am the first in a line, how can I hide away. Today, since Xiao Yicai has shown his kindness to me, most of it is for the sake of fighting in the future and leaving a feeling. Anyway, we have to take a step. Let&rsquo;s take a look. &quot;</p>
<p>Su Ru sighed and nodded, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s all I have to do. &quot;</p>
<p>With the sound of &ldquo;woo&rdquo;, there was a wind in the unknown depth of the forest.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan felt a chill on his neck. He looked up at the trees and danced like a demon. His brow was slightly wrinkled, but he thought that the ghost spirit in the forest tonight was very different from that in the past. But then I thought, I have lived here for many days, and I have never seen any evil things. Is it because the sky is darker?</p>
<p>Thinking of this, he felt funny in his own heart, so he had to move forward quickly.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, behind him, the voice of the ghost howled in a sudden, pressing into the ear. Zhang Xiaofan lost his color in a panic, turned around at once, and his face turned white at once. I saw that in the back road, in the dark, slowly lit up a flashing red light of the skull, flying to the air, rotating.</p>
<p>Only in the ghost&rsquo;s crying, the red skull gradually stopped, facing Zhang Xiaofan. Zhang Xiaofan could not help shivering when he saw only the deep hole in his eyes as if there were some quiet fire.</p>
<p>A moment later, behind the ghost, two figures rose slowly. Against the light of the red skull, Zhang Xiaofan saw that one of them was a tall and thin old man with a ferocious face and a haggard face, almost skin and bone. It seemed that he was not far from the red skull. He stared at Zhang Xiaofan with a fierce eyes, which was full of indignation.</p>
<p>But the other man looked rather embarrassed. Although he was tall, he was carried by the old man like a chicken. He couldn&rsquo;t move. His face was helpless and depressed.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan looked intently, couldn&rsquo;t help but be surprised, and said &ldquo;eh&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This man looks familiar, but he is an acquaintance. He was first seen under the wanbat ancient cave in kongsang mountain. These days, he has seen several times of wild dog Taoist in Liubo mountain. He was carried by the withered old man with the collar in his right hand, and his face was crying. But in a flash, he saw Zhang Xiaofan standing in front of him. He looked at him in surprise, and immediately pointed to Zhang Xiaofan as if he had seen the Savior. &ldquo;Ah! It&rsquo;s him, it&rsquo;s him! &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was shocked. He saw the dog Taoist pointing to himself and barking incessantly. He didn&rsquo;t know what it meant. But the old man glared at himself with a harsh and hoarse voice, and said to the wild dog Taoist, &ldquo;is this little boy from Qingyun gate? &quot;</p>
<p>The wild dog nodded incessantly, even saying, &ldquo;yes, yes, he is the only one who killed you, the vampire Jiang Laosan. (to be continued). )</p>
