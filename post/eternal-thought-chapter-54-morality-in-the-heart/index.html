      <p>Seeing that the two clansmen with six layers of condensation gas are about to escape, Bai Xiaochun pinches the formula, and with the whistling of the small wooden sword, she immediately flies across the neck of a six layer condensed gas clansman.</p>
<p>Until death, the eyes of the six layers of condensed gas were filled with unprecedented horror and fear.</p>
<p>They were supposed to be hunters, but now On the contrary, he became the slain!</p>
<p>In a short time, Bai Xiaochun killed four people in a row!</p>
<p>He just joined hands to besiege Bai Xiaochun, the last one of the six layers of Congqi people. At the moment, his face was pale, and his heart was pounding and his body was shaking. He could not imagine that the thin, white and pure Lingxi sect disciple in front of him actually So terrible.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s eyes show fierce, just about to pursue, but at this time, suddenly a sense of crisis arises in his heart.</p>
<p>At the same time, Du Lingfei&rsquo;s anxious voice also came at this moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be careful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s body suddenly retreated. At the moment when he retreated, a purple skull, one ten feet in size, appeared at the place where he was just now, and burst into self explosion.</p>
<p>With a bang, the impact of the force of self explosion shocked Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s whole body. His immortal iron sheet felt pain for the first time, and his mouth overflowed with blood, and his body kept retreating.</p>
<p>It was Chen Yue, who was the eighth layer of condensate.</p>
<p>His face was ugly and his eyes were dignified. After rescuing his own people, he shook his body and went straight to Bai Xiaochun. Behind him, the two clansmen with six layers of condensation gas were biting their teeth and following him.</p>
<p>The three went straight to Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>Hou Yunfei struggled to help, but he was already weak. He spent the last trace of aura before fighting. At the moment, the corner of his mouth overflowed with blood and could not fight.</p>
<p>Du Lingfei is also seriously injured. At the moment, in her anxiety, she looks at Bai Xiaochun. All the hostility and prejudice towards Bai Xiaochun have disappeared.</p>
<p>White small pure complexion is pale, again overflows the blood, the body is tottering, the speed also slows down, Chen Yue three people see so, pursue closer.</p>
<p>But at the moment when the three people approached, Bai Xiaochun suddenly had a fierce flash in his eyes. Chen Yue&rsquo;s technique bombarded him before. Although the immortal iron sheet of the tower could not be completely blocked, it also dissipated most of it. It seemed weak, and there was blood in the corner of his mouth. All these were deliberately pretended by him.</p>
<p>At the moment, the speed suddenly increases, not retrogression, but at the speed of this instantaneous surge, it directly crosses with Chen Yue. His goal is They are the two Chen family members of the sixth condensate layer.</p>
<p>Chen Yue&rsquo;s face changes and he is about to stop him. The sound of whistling suddenly whirls. Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s wooden sword goes straight to him. Chen Yue pinches a key and immediately appears a skull in front of him. The roar can&rsquo;t stop Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>His eyes showed a fierce color, a big sleeve a swing, immediately a lantern appeared, directly turned into a fireball, called a straight to Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>At the same time, the two disciples of the sixth floor of condensation gas were shocked and screamed and retreated rapidly. However, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s figure broke out completely like lightning, and the speed was so fast that he directly caught up with one person. When his right hand was raised, his thumb and index finger flashed black, and he pinched the Chen family members in front of him.</p>
<p>Break the lock!</p>
<p>With a click, the Chen family disciple screamed. After his neck was pinched by Bai Xiaochun Sheng, the fireball behind him was approaching. The high temperature spread. He had no time to dodge. With a bang, the fireball fell directly in front of him.</p>
<p>When it broke out, a sea of fire enveloped Bai Xiaochun. Du Lingfei and Hou Yunfei exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bai Xiaochun</p>
<p>Not far away, the people with six layers of condensed gas showed surprise. Seeing Bai Xiaochun engulfed by the fire, he burst into laughter.</p>
<p>But at this time, there was a figure in the sea of fire, suddenly rushed out, and quickly approached the laughing people of the sixth floor of Chen&rsquo;s family. When the man&rsquo;s eyes were wide open and his body was about to retreat, Bai Xiaochun dropped his foot and smashed his head into his body. Even the scream could not be heard out, and he died directly.</p>
<p>After all this, Bai Xiaochun is out of breath. He has more blood in his eyes, more skin burns, and blood spills from the corners of his mouth. When he looks up, he stares at the last Chen family member here Chen Yue!</p>
<p>Chen Yue&rsquo;s heart was staring at him. His cultivation was eight layers of condensation, and he was one of the pride of heaven in the whole family. Although he was not as good as the young clan leader, he was also appreciated by his ancestors. He fought with fierce beasts in the Luoxing mountain range on weekdays and experienced several life and death trials, and his combat power was excellent.</p>
<p>He did not look down on the disciples of Lingxi sect. Although the status of each other was higher than himself, he always believed that the monks in the sect were all flowers in captivity. Although they had extraordinary magical powers, they were not as good as themselves in the fight between life and death.</p>
<p>But now, he felt fear in Bai Xiaochun, especially his eyes, which were even more terrible than those fierce beasts he met in the Luoxing mountains.</p>
<p>The ferocity in his eyes seemed to engulf him, which made Chen Yue feel cold.</p>
<p>In particular, he thought that the other side had killed six people in a short period of time. His mind was strongly shaken by this method. What he felt was that he had already seen the accomplishments of the other side Actually, it is only the sixth layer of condensate gas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His strength is too strong and his speed is extremely fast. He has practiced some kind of body building skill, and has reached a certain level, so he can kill people with one blow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Especially his protection, too terrible!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Although he doesn&rsquo;t have any skills, he is not an ordinary person to control the flying sword. Not only is his speed faster than expected, but the power of each sword is amazing. The wooden sword is also very high, so he can kill six layers of condensation gas instantly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This kind of character must be the famous Tianjiao of Lingxi sect. Why have I never heard of his name before, Bai Xiaochun?&rdquo; When Chen Yue was frightened, he also raised a stronger sense of war. With a wave of his right hand, he immediately appeared in front of him three fist sized skeletons made of jade.</p>
<p>He looks dignified and looks at Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I looked down on you before, but now I can&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;ll see if it&rsquo;s your Lingxi sect&rsquo;s skill or my Chen family&rsquo;s sharp ghost killing way!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as the words came out, Chen Yue pinched the Jue, and immediately the three skeletons around him, as if they were alive, roared and became huge, and each one reached the size of a Zhang, and went straight to Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun is short of breath. At the moment, his mind is blank, without any thoughts. He has long forgotten death. Some of them just want to kill each other&rsquo;s impulse.</p>
<p>Seeing the skeletons coming, he pinched the formula with his right hand, pointed forward, and the small wooden sword roared out. At the same time, two flying swords appeared in a flash. He actually manipulated three flying swords and turned into a large amount of sword light, which rushed out directly with his body.</p>
<p>There is also a small shield around the body, emitting precious light.</p>
<p>In a flash, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s flying sword met those holes. When the sound of roar reverberated, he and Chen Yue were both very fast and fought fiercely.</p>
<p>Chen Yue has eight layers of condensate gas. His accomplishments are deeper than that of Bai Xiaochun, but he is not as good as Bai Xiaochun in strength and protection!</p>
<p>This scene, let Du Lingfei heart lift up, she clenched her fist, nail into the flesh do not feel pain.</p>
<p>The hateful figure of Bai Xiaochun disappeared in Xiaobi&rsquo;s time. Instead, he was white Xiaochun, who was fighting with Chen Yue, the family of Luo Chen, with his whole body as iron and blood!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wronged him This is the real Bai Xiaochun&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is really afraid of death, but he can go back and fight with others. The courage he needs is countless times greater than that of ordinary people&hellip;&rdquo; Du Lingfei is looking at Bai Xiaochun, and her eyes slowly show a new look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even though he is afraid of death, he still has persistence in his heart. He will not give up his partner because he is afraid of death&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a while, the sound was deafening. Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s three flying swords, now two of them were destroyed, but the wooden swords were still there, and the three skeletons were very dim at the moment. They were hurt spiritually and flew back to Chen Yue.</p>
<p>At the same time, Bai Xiaochun takes the opportunity to kill him. Chen Yue squirts blood and can&rsquo;t dodge. He is locked by Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s broken waiting lock and presses it directly on his arm. With a click, the bone of his left hand is directly broken. However, a small sword flies out of his mouth, directly stabs Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s shoulder and stabs him into an inch!</p>
<p>The undead iron sheet is hard to stop. When the blood flows down, Chen Yue immediately retreats, but before waiting for him to retreat far away, Bai Xiaochun, regardless of the injury, suddenly chases after him with red eyes. The speed is so fast that he starts to roar.</p>
<p>Chen Yue looks ugly. In the crisis, he bites his teeth and pinches his eyebrows. His body trembles and his Qi and blood roll. He roars and slaps his forehead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bai Xiaochun, today either you or I die!&rdquo; At other times, Chen would have stopped fighting, but now it&rsquo;s about the whole family. He has to kill Bai Xiaochun. At the moment, the blood of life in his body spurts out and is devoured by the three skulls greedily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ferocious and ferocious Chen Yue roared and opened his secret magic power. The three skeletons in front of him suddenly showed a faint light in their eyes. They went straight to Chen Yue, biting wildly. In the blink of an eye, Chen Yue&rsquo;s body swallowed up a lot of flesh and blood and penetrated into his body.</p>
<p>This scene is strange. Du Lingfei and Hou Yunfei take a breath. At the same time, Chen Yue gives out a shrill roar. His body is shaking and his expression is ferocious. There is a lot of black gas outside his body. He turns into a fierce ghost more than ten meters tall!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Die!&rdquo; His voice was loud, his right hand raised and pressed hard toward Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You die!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun roared. When he pinched the formula with both hands, his aura suddenly burst out like a runaway wild horse. In the air, he quickly outlined a huge tripod!</p>
<p>It is</p>
