      <p>Looking in the dark, GUI Li saw the old man&rsquo;s face was clear and thin. He was dressed in a grey robe. He was simple and simple. He had a calm manner. There was nothing outstanding. If you walk on the streets of ordinary towns, no one will recognize him as a man of cultivation.</p>
<p>But look at the two people behind him, not to mention Yan Hong, is Li Xun, who has always been proud. It seems that he also has great respect for this ordinary old man, and dare not be slighted.</p>
<p>At the moment, hearing the old man&rsquo;s question, Li Xun hesitated for a moment, and then said: &ldquo;martial uncle clearly knows that it&rsquo;s actually the heads of the fish people and barbarians who died unexpectedly, so these monsters are crazy. That&rsquo;s why&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this time, the three men just walked down the XuanHuo altar. The old man in grey frowned and said lightly, &ldquo;how did the fish man clan leader die?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li Xun smiled bitterly and shook his head. Yan Hong said: &ldquo;in reply to martial uncle, the fish man clan leader met with martial uncle Lv Shun three days ago at the North Hegu mountain&rsquo;s&rdquo; nameless ancient temple &ldquo;, and was suddenly killed by an expert less than a mile away from the ancient temple.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man in grey said &ldquo;eh&rdquo;, obviously surprised, and said: &ldquo;who is the murderer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li Xun shook his head and said, &ldquo;we have checked for several days, but we have no clue.&rdquo; Speaking of this, he seemed to hesitate for a moment, then continued: &ldquo;it should have been reported to martial uncle, but the valley leader and martial uncle have been guarding the important place of XuanHuo altar for nearly a hundred years, and they have not asked about common things, so they do not want to disturb martial uncle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man in grey smiled and said: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know the valley master&rsquo;s kindness. I think if it&rsquo;s not for these barbarians, and I was still famous when I accepted them, the valley master wouldn&rsquo;t bother me</p>
<p>Li Xun smiled and was about to say something, but the old man in grey didn&rsquo;t seem to want to say anything about this topic, so he turned away and said, &ldquo;wasn&rsquo;t Lu Shun there? Can&rsquo;t he find the murderer without a mile? Three feet of earth has been dug out. &quot;</p>
<p>Hearing this, Li Xun can&rsquo;t help but look at Yan Hong beside him. Yan Hong hesitated for a moment and said in a soft voice: &ldquo;I think the murderer is too cunning and has a high way of doing things. After a hit, he immediately ran away, so even uncle Lu could not catch him. &quot;</p>
<p>The old man in grey snorted, but this time he didn&rsquo;t say anything more, but in the look and voice. A sense of disdain came out, obviously looking down upon the appearance of martial uncle Lv Shun in the mouth of Li Xun and Yan Hong.</p>
<p>As they walked, they said that the distance of only three feet in the open space had passed by a little and a half, and they were also gradually far away from Gui Li. Ghost Li slowly let go, but the body still dare not relax. At this time, I only heard that the old man in grey clothes seemed to ask a question from a distance, because he had gone far, and his voice was not clear, but I vaguely heard that the old man in grey clothes asked how the rebellious fish people and barbarians were.</p>
<p>Li Xun replied, &ldquo;now the situation is stable. Martial uncle LV and his disciples block the monsters at the entrance of the valley, and exert their powers to suppress the spirit of the fish man. Now the two sides are facing each other. The fishermen said that they would take revenge for their clan leader, but the valley master didn&rsquo;t want to completely tear his face with the South barbarians. So I sent us to invite martial uncle&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>The words just said here, all of a sudden, the distance Valley entrance direction of a shriek, far reverberated, the voice is extremely bleak. Everyone was surprised. Li Xun said: &ldquo;it seems to be at the entrance!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before they could make a response, the sound of fighting rose again in a moment, and the roar of fury was heard. The valley that had just been silent was once again shrouded in the sound of fighting.</p>
<p>The faces of the three men changed greatly, and the old man in grey snorted. With a wave of the sleeve robe, the whole person suddenly turned into a gray light and soared towards the entrance of the valley. Li Xun and Yan Hong were also in a hurry to catch up.</p>
<p>Until their figure completely disappeared in the night. The ghost Li just slowly walked out from under the XuanHuo altar, pondered for a moment, turned to look at the XuanHuo altar.</p>
<p>At present, the huge building is towering. Even a white jade pillar beside it is so tall and majestic in the night, let alone the Red Palace above it.</p>
<p>Not far ahead. It&rsquo;s the step where the old man in grey, Li Xun and Yan Hong just stepped down. As he walked towards the steps, he saw that all the steps were also built with the same kind of strange red stone as the high ones, which were integrated with the surrounding railings.</p>
<p>Slowly step on it, go up, now the heat around seems to rise a lot, as if the foot is not the kind of red stone, but the real burning flame.</p>
<p>This step of xuanhuotan went up thirty-six steps, turned a corner, and continued to go up. Ghost Li deep breath, face cold, slowly go up. The surrounding railings and stone walls are all plain and plain, without any carving, especially plain.</p>
<p>At the moment, the wind from the night sky is also very hot and dry. Little ash lies on his shoulders. His eyes are rolling around and looking around curiously.</p>
<p>Finally, after walking three 108 steps, Guili came to the XuanHuo altar.</p>
<p>Although I have just seen the scene here from afar under the XuanHuo altar, now I am on the XuanHuo altar, standing in front of the tall hall in the middle of the XuanHuo altar, looking at the huge building 100 times larger than myself, and looking at the spire like a sharp sword piercing the sky, I can&rsquo;t help but feel small.</p>
<p>Red stone of the same material is cut into huge stones of the same size, each of which is more than half a person tall and piled into a grand palace. Go to the nearest place, in the hot and dry air, it&rsquo;s clear that the stones are so tightly connected, and the gap in the middle seems that even the blade can&rsquo;t be inserted. It&rsquo;s impossible to imagine how the ancestors of the burning incense Valley built such a palace.</p>
<p>Even he almost had an illusion that what was in front of him was not a temple at all, but a huge flaming fire. And the flame is so huge that it seems to be about to overwhelm and engulf the tiny self.</p>
<p>GUI Li breathed deeply, calmed his mind, pressed down his feeling of surprise and admiration, then turned his head and looked carefully at the way to enter the hall of XuanHuo altar. He found it with little effort.</p>
<p>The whole tower like altar has no window, and is surrounded by huge red stones. Only at the bottom is not far away from him. There is a door with a height of one foot and a width of six feet.</p>
<p>Ghost Li walked past, and soon found that although the door was painted with red paint, it was different from the surrounding stone wall, but a wooden door. I think so. If even the entrance is a heavy stone gate, it must be a lot of trouble!</p>
<p>Ghost Li stood in front of the door for a while, but did not immediately push the door, but turned to look back.</p>
<p>On the whole XuanHuo altar. Except for the hot air, there was silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Squeak!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next moment, he opened the door.</p>
<p>At the entrance of the burning incense Valley, there is already a river of blood. More than a hundred tall and strong fish headed barbarians shout. It&rsquo;s extremely angry. It has all kinds of strange weapons, including guns, knives, swords, halberds, and fights with the disciples of the burning incense valley.</p>
<p>There was blood on the ground and debris everywhere. There were many disciples of burning incense Valley among the casualties, but most of them were fish people.</p>
<p>As for these mutilated limbs, I&rsquo;m afraid they were cut down by the cruel fishers.</p>
<p>However, although the scene is terrible, the fishman is also fierce. But the situation is that this side of the burning incense Valley gradually suppressed the fishermen, and obviously there is still room for them to go to the burning incense valley. Dozens of disciples with higher Taoism form a semicircle shape and press inward together.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that these fish people are really fierce, and their bodies are very different from those of human beings. Even if a man in the cultivation gets a sword light from a disciple of the burning incense Valley, he will be injured even if he is afraid of it. However, these fish people are extremely strong for some reason. In addition, the people in the burning incense Valley seem to get some orders, leaving room. In addition to the swords of a few masters. Other disciple&rsquo;s magic weapon was hit on him. The fisherman was hit and flew out at most. It was very difficult to see blood.</p>
<p>However, in the burning incense Valley, people have been practicing Taoism for many years. Single to single plus the power of magic weapons still surpasses these barbarian fishermen; secondly, these fishermen are just powerful and thick skinned. There are evidences for the disciples of the burning incense Valley to advance and retreat. Sometimes they drive their swords up and down from the middle of the air, which often makes their heads hurt and still prevail.</p>
<p>Among the disciples of the burning incense valley. An old man was in the middle of the command. It was Lu shun that ghost Li saw in the ancient temple of barren mountain that day. At the moment, I saw his brows were frowning and his face was ugly, obviously very angry.</p>
<p>When the fight was fierce, suddenly there was a scream. However, a disciple of the burning incense valley was careless for a while and showed a flaw. He was caught by a fishman with a weapon like a sickle. Sheng Sheng dragged down from the air and fell to the ground. In a moment, several fishermen swarmed around, and the blades were dancing wildly. In a flash, they were killed, not even dead.</p>
<p>In a flash, the disciples of the burning incense valley were furious. Many people couldn&rsquo;t control it any more. Their hands were strengthened. The flying sword, a magic weapon flying all over the sky, suddenly roared and attacked. But for a moment, the cry went out, and several fishermen had been killed by the life and death of the magic weapon.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that these fish are really fierce in nature. Seeing the scene of blood flying, they are not afraid, but they are crazy to fight, they are brave to die.</p>
<p>Lu Shun drove the sword to the sky and drank loudly. But no one at the bottom, no matter the fisherman or the disciples of the burning incense Valley, had killed his eyes. No one cared about his words and saw that a bigger massacre was about to start.</p>
<p>At this time, the sky was suddenly dark. Lu Shun frowned and looked up at the sky, only to see a cloud of grey come. Lu Shun&rsquo;s face changed and he could not help humming.</p>
<p>How fast the grey cloud came, and it was flying in front of us in an instant, and it became more and more powerful. Only the wind in the middle of the sky turned rapidly, and gradually turned into a tornado with a diameter of several meters, mixed with a sharp voice, &ldquo;woo&rdquo; and rushed down from the night sky.</p>
<p>Almost at the same time, all the flowers, plants and trees around the ground were turned outwards by the strong wind. The sand and flying stones on the ground went away. The disciples of the burning incense Valley and some fishermen with low skill were even swept up and thrown out by the strong wind.</p>
<p>The crowd was shocked, but they didn&rsquo;t react. The Tornado had fallen to the ground. In the sharp wind, the sound of &ldquo;bang bang&rdquo; was loud. If dozens of fishermen were caught by giant hands, Qi Qi Qi was hit to fly, flew back, and fell to the ground heavily.</p>
<p>The fishermen were squeaking and shrieking, but they were quite frightened. Only after the wind turned for a moment and separated all the fishermen from the disciples of the burning incense Valley, did it stop slowly. The wind gradually subsided, and the huge wind gradually disappeared, showing the figure of an old man in grey.</p>
<p>One of the disciples of the burning incense valley was shocked, and then they fell to the ground one after another, saluted the old man together, and said respectfully, &ldquo;master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Shun also slowly fell back to the ground at the moment, came over, looked at the old man in grey, his face was blue, and then he said with a smile: &ldquo;elder martial brother, how can you be shocked by such small things?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man in grey looked at him. A light smile, said: &ldquo;Valley master has orders, I have to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Shun&rsquo;s face changed.</p>
<p>At this time, Li Xun and Yan Hong have arrived, falling from the air. Li Xun goes to Lvshun. Lowering his voice, he said softly, &ldquo;Uncle Lu, the valley master asked me to invite uncle Shangguan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Shun snorted. His face was even worse, but after all, he said nothing more. Turn around.</p>
<p>The old man in grey didn&rsquo;t look at him either. He turned around and looked at the bloody ground. His face sank.</p>
<p>At this time, the fishermen gathered in one place, and their eyes fell on the old man in grey. But at the moment, they seem to recognize the old man in grey. Somehow, these fish people are fearless of death, but they are afraid of the ordinary old man in grey. For a while, they dare not rush forward.</p>
<p>The old man in grey took back his eyes and said in a deep voice, &ldquo;where is sun Tu?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as the voice fell, a middle-aged man came out of the disciples of the burning incense valley. It was Sun Tu who went with Lu shun that night and knew the language of the barbarians.</p>
<p>I saw him running to the old man in grey, with a very respectful face, saying: &ldquo;I am here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man in grey looked at him, and saw that he was ashen. It seems that in the fight just now, because he didn&rsquo;t have a high level of Taoism, he was afraid that he had suffered a lot, but he didn&rsquo;t die. After all, there are not many people who can understand these barbarian languages.</p>
<p>The old man in grey said, &ldquo;come and turn their words over to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sun Tu answered carefully and stood aside.</p>
<p>The old man in grey looks at the fisherman. Long voice way: &ldquo;old husband is superior official policy, come out a person to talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a stir in the fish crowd, obviously they understood the words of the superior officer. And the name seems to have a magic effect on them, which is extraordinary. After a while. A tall Fishman came out.</p>
<p>Shangguance looked at him twice and said slowly, &ldquo;do you know me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fishman hesitated for a moment and said, &ldquo;Jijijiji&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They know,&rdquo; Sun Tu, who was next to him, immediately translated</p>
<p>Shangguan CE&rsquo;s face remained unchanged and said, &ldquo;why do you attack my Valley? Do you not deceive me that there is no one in the burning incense Valley?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Fishman&rsquo;s face was angry, and he began to speak. Loud is anger.</p>
<p>Sun Tubian listened and translated: &ldquo;he said:&rdquo; our patriarch was killed when he met with your people. You said that you couldn&rsquo;t find the murderer. It&rsquo;s clear You did it. Although we fishmen are not your opponents, we should also fight to death to avenge the patriarch! &quot;</p>
<p>The superior officer planned to frown tightly, with a trace of sadness in his eyes. He is the top person in the burning incense valley. His journey is unfathomable. In a secret fierce battle with the barbarians in the south of Xinjiang a hundred years ago, the superior officer planned to show his power and awe the barbarians. Since then, his reputation has spread far among the 63 barbarians. Today, Yun Yilan, the leader of the burning incense Valley, let him come out for a long time, for this reason.</p>
<p>And Shangguan has lived in the south of Xinjiang for a long time. His understanding of these barbarians in the hundred thousand mountains is beyond comparison with others. This fish man barbarian alone knows how fierce it is, and the death of the patriarch is an unprecedented humiliation for them. It is really possible to die here regardless of everything.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s just this alien race, the superior official policy will not be taken seriously. It&rsquo;s just that the barbarians in the south of Xinjiang are fighting with each other on the surface, but the internal and internal relations are complicated. What&rsquo;s more, there has been a peerless person in the past hundred years, which is very important. In case that person is disturbed, I&rsquo;m afraid that the grand plan of burning incense Valley for one hundred years will be destroyed.</p>
<p>In his mind, Li Xun looks down at Guan CE and ponders. He whispers to sun: &ldquo;when I left just now, I didn&rsquo;t control the situation. There was a confrontation between the two sides, and the fishermen didn&rsquo;t intend to do anything. Do you want our valley master to come out and talk? How could they fight again? &quot;</p>
<p>Sun Tu smiled bitterly and said, &ldquo;we are just strange! Originally, it was OK. Although I was a little nervous, I didn&rsquo;t mean to continue to work on both sides. Unexpectedly, there was a scream from the fishman. A fishman at the edge was killed somehow. Then the Fishman&rsquo;s eyes turned red and rushed up like crazy&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>When the superior officer heard this, he suddenly said in a deep voice, &ldquo;did our people do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sun TU was tongue tied for a while, but Lu Shun beside him said coldly: &ldquo;at that time, there was a mess. Who knows?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shangguance&rsquo;s face was cold. He suddenly raised his voice and shouted to all the disciples of the burning incense Valley, &ldquo;did someone kill the fisherman just now when they were fighting each other?&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the people in the burning incense valley were silent. All the disciples looked at me and I looked at you. For a while, no one came forward to admit it.</p>
<p>In the distance, there was a commotion among the fishermen, obviously furious.</p>
<p>The superior officer, with his brows locked, said to the fish standing in front of him, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see the body of that man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, without waiting for the fish man to answer, he went straight.</p>
<p>The fish man&rsquo;s face changed, but looking at the look of shangguance, he finally turned around, took him to a corner next to the crowd, identified it, and then pointed to the body of a fish man, &ldquo;Jiji&rdquo; said a few words.</p>
<p>At this time, Lu Shun, Li Xun, sun Tu, etc. also followed shangguance. Sun Tu whispered, &ldquo;this fish man is the one who died.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shangguance stood next to the corpse and looked carefully. His face gradually became ugly. A moment later, he whispered to himself, &ldquo;powerful, powerful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li Xun stood behind him and looked at the body. He could not help but frown. I saw that the body of the fisherman was still holding a big knife, but the head on his neck was gone. There was a head of the fisherman nearby. It seemed that it was him.</p>
<p>The fish man was beheaded by a clean and sharp man.</p>
<p>Li Xun&rsquo;s eyes fell on that neck unexpectedly, only to see that the wound was extremely flat, apparently killed by a very sharp blade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh!&rdquo; All of a sudden, Lu Shun, who was next to him, whispered and went up, squatted down and looked at the dead body of the fish man carefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; he frowned</p>
<p>Lu Shun shredded meat as like as two peas. He looked up for a while, and slowly stood up, but his face was very ugly. He said, &ldquo;this wound is exactly like the wound left by the killer when he killed the head of the fish man. The wound was flat, and the muscles were not distorted, but the deep veins did not know why they had a slight purple color.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were shocked and looked at it carefully, as Lv Shun said.</p>
<p>Shangguance was shocked in his heart. He looked back and said: &ldquo;this murderer is here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The superior officer&rsquo;s eyes are sharp as knives. An ordinary old man suddenly seems to have an irresistible edge. He slowly looked at everyone around him, but no one dared to look at him directly.</p>
<p>There was a sudden silence in the field, only the night wind from nowhere, rustling over the branches. (to be continued. )</p>
