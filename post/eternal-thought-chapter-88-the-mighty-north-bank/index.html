      <p>Almost at the moment when Zheng Yuandong&rsquo;s words came out, all the disciples on both sides of the Taiwan Strait were shocked and subconsciously looked up at the terrace above.</p>
<p>Almost as soon as they saw it, there were four earthshaking thoughts of divine consciousness, which suddenly appeared from the top of Zhongdao mountain and the snow covered forbidden area, sweeping all the people.</p>
<p>After being swept away by these four divine senses, all the disciples of the outer sect, including Bai Xiaochun, trembled. The feeling was an absolute suppression. It seemed that with one glance, all people, all the forms and spirits could be destroyed.</p>
<p>Not only Bai Xiaochun was like this, but even the Shangguan Tianyou and those Tianjiao on the north bank all trembled. But soon, these people were excited and excited.</p>
<p>Elder Taishang was paying close attention to the battle. This kind of thing immediately made these qualified disciples breathe quickly and show a strong light in their eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you can attract the attention of the elder Taishang, take him as a registered disciple&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this war, we must do our best.&rdquo; At this moment, bursts of evil spirit broke out from the outside disciples on both sides of the north and the south.</p>
<p>Only Bai Xiaochun blinked here.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elder Taishang, the same level as my master? That&rsquo;s my uncle&hellip; &quot; Bai Xiaochun immediately felt proud that his status was too high. He thought that he should visit the four martial uncles after the Tianjiao battle.</p>
<p>At this time, Zheng Yuandong, the leader of the terrace, threw his big sleeve, and suddenly a ball of light appeared out of thin air, flew out of the air and went straight to the battle platform. On this stage, the light was shining and divided into 22 parts. After being caught by Bai Xiaochun and others, they immediately looked down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eleven?&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun takes a glance and wants to peep at others, and finds that Shangguan Tianyou and others are all hidden tightly, so that no one else can see them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the first battle, those who hold one or two pearls, come to the battle platform!&rdquo; On the terrace above, a bleak voice came out, not Zheng Yuandong, but Ouyang Jie of law enforcement hall.</p>
<p>At the moment when his words echoed, a man flew out from the north bank. He looked tall and thin, and looked cold and proud. As soon as he appeared, he immediately received a lot of cheers from the north bank. Although he was not the five Tianjiao on the north bank, he was also proud of the momentum of those disciples on the north bank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;North bank, Liu Yun!&rdquo; This tall and thin young man got on the battle platform. When he spoke with pride, Shangguan Tianyou stepped out of the battle platform and stood on the platform.</p>
<p>&ldquo;South bank, God bless you He stood there with a cold look and a sharp sword in his body. When his words came out, it seemed that the temperature around him had dropped.</p>
<p>At the moment of Shangguan Tianyou&rsquo;s going out to battle, all the outer disciples here on the south bank burst out with astonishing cheers to boost Shangguan Tianyou.</p>
<p>A thin young man&rsquo;s face changed. He didn&rsquo;t expect that when he first appeared on the stage, he met Tianjiao, who was famous for his fame on the south bank. At the moment, his face was ugly. After taking a deep breath, there was no distortion around him. There was a huge boa constrictor, which appeared with a fishy wind. It was more than a foot high.</p>
<p>However, before the tall and thin young man summoned his fierce beast, Shangguan Tianyou walked out without any expression, and his body disappeared in an instant. When he appeared, he was astonished behind the tall and thin young man. With a wave of his right hand, a flying sword appeared on his neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The thin and tall young man&rsquo;s body was full of chills, and his look was appalled. He looked back hard at Shangguan Tianyou. He could not believe it. He knew that he might not be the opponent of the other party, but he didn&rsquo;t expect to lose so fast. For a long time, he bowed his head bitterly, put away the python, and walked off the stage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Win the first battle, ha ha, this time we will win the south bank!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Senior brother Shangguan, that&rsquo;s the person who can fight for the first place!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The south bank cheered. When countless people were excited, Bai Xiaochun opened his eyes. He didn&rsquo;t see Shangguan Tianyou&rsquo;s body method. He only felt that Shangguan Tianyou&rsquo;s action was extraordinary.</p>
<p>There are even two supreme elders&rsquo; divine consciousness. At this moment, they all focus on Shangguan Tianyou.</p>
<p>At the same time, there was an uproar on the north bank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blink? impossible!! What kind of cultivation is he? This is not a blink of an eye! &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the law of emptiness, this man He deserves to be the first day of pride on the south bank. He has such an empty and magical power</p>
<p>At the moment, Tianjiao on the north bank also looks different one by one. Beihanlie&rsquo;s eyes flash and looks dignified. Gongsun&rsquo;s brother and sister are the same, and Xu Song&rsquo;s heart is sinking.</p>
<p>Only the black robed young ghost tooth always closed his eyes and never opened them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;World War II!&rdquo; Just as the cheering and uproar of the crowd became more and more intense, the voice of Ouyang Jie on the upper terrace interrupted the discussion.</p>
<p>In Tianjiao on the north bank, a young man with a little fat body and a short stature walked on the stage after hearing his speech. He was smiling and smiling, as if people and animals were harmless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;North bank, Xu Song.&rdquo; He laughs towards a disciple who comes out from the south bank at the moment and speaks politely.</p>
<p>The man who walked out of the south bank was not Lu Tianlei and others, but a young man who had hidden his accomplishments and broke out in the qualification war. The young man&rsquo;s face was ugly at the moment, and he recognized that the other party was the five Tianjiao on the north bank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;South bank, Zhoufeng!&rdquo; The young man took a deep breath, and his whole body was working. After he spoke in a deep voice, a flying sword appeared in his Jue, but before he could wait to point at Xu Song, Xu Song had a flash of sarcasm in his eyes, and raised his right hand and pressed it down.</p>
<p>With a bang, a crack appeared in the air above Zhou Feng&rsquo;s head. With a click, a giant beast like a whale suddenly appeared. As soon as it was too fast to cover his ears, Zhou Feng&rsquo;s whole body was swallowed by one bite.</p>
<p>The flying sword was cut off by spiritual power and fell to the ground with a bang.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s gratifying and disappointing that I didn&rsquo;t pay attention to the air when I was fighting with my disciples at the top of the dome.&rdquo; With a smile, Xu Song turned and stepped down from the battle platform. With a wave of his right hand behind him, the giant beast opened his mouth and vomited. Zhou Feng&rsquo;s body was vomited out, and he was unconscious in front of the people on the south bank.</p>
<p>People on the south bank look ugly, and many take breath. Even Lu Tianlei and others are shocked.</p>
<p>In contrast, the cheers of the north shore, at this moment, startled the sky.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s heart trembled. He felt that these guys on the north bank were too terrible, and the control of fierce beasts had reached the level of terror.</p>
<p>Soon after the Third World War, Shangguan Wan&rsquo;er, who was also proud of the five Tianjiao, appeared on the north bank. When she saw another person instead of Zhou Xinqi in the south bank, she looked a little disappointed and lost interest. As she waved, the colorful Phoenix bird she was following spat out a colorful mist.</p>
<p>The disciple on the south bank was so dazzled by the colorful fog that he roared on the platform, as if fighting with an enemy invisible to outsiders, and soon collapsed and fainted.</p>
<p>From the beginning to the end, Shangguan Wan&rsquo;er just waved her hand and won easily. When she stepped down, people on the south bank were silent again. When they looked at the north bank, they showed deep fear and felt powerless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tianjiao, only those who are Tianjiao can fight!&rdquo; The disciples of the outer gate of Nan&rsquo;an, with hope, look at the Shangguan Tianyou and others, and many of them look at Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun immediately held her head high. In fact, she was also frightened by Shangguan Wan&rsquo;er.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This little lady seems to be more powerful than Zhou Xinqi.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun swallowed hard.</p>
<p>Soon, the fourth war started, and Lu Tianlei&rsquo;s whole body was shining with thunder. When he rushed to the battle platform, the youth on the north bank, dressed in black robes and always closed his eyes, slowly opened his eyes, looked calm, and stepped onto the stage step by step.</p>
<p>It was strange that he appeared. Actually, no one on the north bank cheered at all, but everyone&rsquo;s looks changed. Even beihanlie and others, who are also five Tianjiao, also took a deep breath.</p>
<p>This scene surprised everyone on the south bank. Lu Tianlei&rsquo;s eyes were fixed on the black robed youth with a dignified look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;North shore, ghost tooth.&rdquo; The black robed youth stood on the stage, calmly opened his mouth, his expression did not change a bit, and even his voice seemed to have no emotion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;South bank, Lu Tianlei!&rdquo; Lu Tianlei took a deep breath. He knew that the other side was the first day arrogant on the north bank. Now his eyes gradually showed a strong sense of war.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I defeat this man at all costs, I will be the first one even if I lose too much to continue fighting again!&rdquo; Lu Tianlei&rsquo;s eyes were full of fighting spirit. He roared, and immediately thunder roared all over his body. Countless lightening fell down. He was the center of the thunder. The circle was ten Zhang and turned into a thunder pool.</p>
<p>But at this time, the ghost tooth quietly raised his right hand and pointed to the sky. Under this finger, the sky suddenly rolled, and countless black clouds appeared out of the sky. In an instant, countless people looked up and looked up. The faces of people on the north bank changed one by one, and many of them showed panic.</p>
<p>Lu Tianlei roared, his body suddenly rushed out, driving the thunder around, straight to the ghost teeth.</p>
<p>The ghost tooth was still expressionless, and even when standing there, he closed his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want to die!&rdquo; Lu Tianlei felt that he had been seriously humiliated. He was proud of himself and had strong self-esteem. At the moment, he roared, and the thunder around him was once again huge and powerful.</p>
<p>But before he got close to the ghost tooth, the whole sky suddenly roared. The black cloud seemed to be torn open by force. A black ghost claw, huge and huge, seemed to hold up the pillar of the sky. In an instant, it stretched out from the clouds. It went straight to the earth. In the blink of an eye, it came down to LV Tianlei and was suddenly pressed down.</p>
<p>Before he could get close, Lu Tianlei&rsquo;s whole body trembled and his blood gushed out. All the thunder outside his body made a huge struggle and collapsed quickly. Even the ground under his feet was also in this instant click, and there was a circle of fragmentation.</p>
<p>His whole body at this moment, blood constantly burst out, roaring, bleeding seven orifices, trying to struggle, but a burst of despair, let Lu Tianlei&rsquo;s world, instant dark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No</p>
<p>At the moment of the appearance of the ghost claw, all the disciples could not control their fear. Even in this fear, the aura in the body was suppressed, and there was an illusion that the soul would be drawn out.</p>
<p>On the terrace, the face of the headmaster and others also changed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ghost night walk, thousands of years no one can cultivate, this son has cultivated to this level!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not good!&rdquo; As soon as Xu Meixiang&rsquo;s face changed, she suddenly flew out of her body and went straight to the battle platform. Her right hand was raised and waved to the ghost claw. Although the ghost claw was lifted, it did not collapse in the air.</p>
<p>Lu Tianlei&rsquo;s blood spurted out in a large amount, and he was in a coma. If Xu Meixiang came slowly, he would become flesh and mud at this moment, and his body and spirit would be destroyed.</p>
<p>Xu Meixiang&rsquo;s heart sank and looked at the ghost tooth coldly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m young, although I have talent, but I&rsquo;m so vicious that I can&rsquo;t kill my classmates in front of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ghost tooth was silent, and his face showed some strange expressions. He seemed to have no idea what emotion he should express on his face at the moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect that he was so weak.&rdquo; Ghost teeth looked up at Xu Meixiang, calmly giving a very serious feeling. After that, he turned and walked off the stage.</p>
<p>Xu Meixiang frowned and looked up at the terrace. She seemed to be worried about something. She picked up LV Tianlei and left with a cold hum. LV Tianlei could not continue to participate in the war. Even his injury was so serious that it would be difficult to recover in a short time.</p>
<p>The north bank is silent, so is the south bank.</p>
<p>Only the figure of ghost teeth, as if with endless loneliness, silently returned to the original position, stood there, continued to close his eyes.</p>
<p>After a long time, the north bank recovered first, and they cheered one by one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no one on the south bank. Tianjiao is not an opponent. You will lose this time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve lost three games, and you won the first game with good luck, and then you&rsquo;ll lose in a row.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the face of the north bank&rsquo;s ridicule, the people on the south bank all show bitterness. The north bank It&rsquo;s too strong.</p>
<p>Only the south bank won the first game, and then three games in a row, all failed. Tianjiao LV Tianlei almost died in the war. This scene made Nan&rsquo;an desperate to be ashamed before snow.</p>
<p>He was shocked by his fear of death.</p>
<p>Not only he is so, but all Tianjiao on the south bank, including Zhou Xinqi, are shocked at the moment. The north bank This time, even if only one ghost tooth, it seems to be able to sweep the South Bank of the same generation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not condensate anymore Even one blow from the palm can&rsquo;t kill his ghost hand. This is Among the ten secret arts in Lingxi sect, only two are called unique skills Ghost night trip</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only thing that can be compared with ghost night travel is Water country</p>
<p>He was shocked by the fact that he was so shocked.</p>
<p>Soon after the fifth World War, the people who came out of the north bank were as bitter as the people on the south bank. To Fang, it was in those five Tianjiao that many people felt shocked Gongsun Yun.</p>
<p>He was wearing a black robe, but in his yellow eyes, it was obvious that there were insects coming and going. After a long time, a disciple on the south bank bravely went to the battle platform. Almost he had just gone up. Before he could introduce each other, Gongsun yunmu showed cold. When he swung his sleeve, he immediately buzzed and echoed from his sleeve. Countless black insects flew out and went straight to the south bank to fight And go.</p>
<p>No matter how the disciple resisted, it did not help. Soon, he was covered with countless black insects. All the protection was useless. It seemed that there was a hole in the hole. Everyone was shocked. Even the people on the north bank couldn&rsquo;t adapt to this scene one by one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give up!&rdquo; The disciple on the south bank rushed to open his mouth with a trill. He felt these insects on his body. One by one, he seemed to devour himself with only one thought of the other.</p>
<p>When Gongsun Yun turned around and walked down the battle platform, the black insects rushed to the ground like the tide, ran quickly, climbed onto Gongsun Yun&rsquo;s body and disappeared into his sleeve.</p>
<p>Looking at this scene, Bai Xiaochun felt a little numb on his scalp. Not only did he, but Zhou Xinqi, even if Shangguan Tianyou, felt more depressed.</p>
<p>At this moment, all the disciples of the south bank felt that the north bank was so strong that the south bank was no match at all. All of them sighed at the Tianjiao battle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We lost this time&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;North bank Too strong</p>
<p>At the same time, the other side of the north shore won again, with a tremendous momentum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I said before, you can only win the first battle, and then all of you will lose!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;South bank? It&rsquo;s just a joke. It&rsquo;s always under our north bank! &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thirty years ago, a man from the south bank entered the top ten. This time None of you can get in! &quot; The voice of the north bank spread all around, and the south bank had the heart to refute, but they could not speak one by one, only felt the shame to the extreme.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the sixth battle, those who hold eleven or twelve beads will go to the battle platform!&rdquo; Ouyang Jie&rsquo;s voice came out suddenly after Gongsun Yun left.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun took a deep breath and immediately looked up. He was holding the 11th pearl.</p>
<p>。</p>
