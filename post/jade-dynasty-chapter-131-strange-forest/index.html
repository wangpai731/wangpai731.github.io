      <p>The great wizard was silent for a moment and said, &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a sharp silence.</p>
<p>We hope that you can help the common people to live and die</p>
<p>The corner of his eyes twitched for a moment and said, &ldquo;the five ethnic groups in southern Xinjiang have a large population. Why do you have to ask for help from an outsider?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The great wizard shook his head and said in a bleak voice: &ldquo;since the division of the five clans, the witchcraft has been declining day by day. Nowadays, there is no decent talent who can undertake this mission. I have promised you that you asked me to summon the soul of your friend. However, the situation you said is not the same as that in southern Xinjiang. I am not sure. But I will try my best to accompany you to Zhongtu early tomorrow morning. &quot;</p>
<p>Both GUI Li and Xiao Bai were stunned. They didn&rsquo;t expect that the great wizard was in such a hurry. GUI Li is not even afraid of death for the sake of Biyao. How can he care about taking risks to rob the sacred vessels in the legend? However, although he was happy in his heart, he could see that the great wizard was seriously injured and said, &ldquo;master, you fought last night Don&rsquo;t you take a few days off first? &quot;</p>
<p>With a low sigh, the great wizard said, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t had many days. Before that, I&rsquo;ll do my best for you. I just hope you can give a hand to the countless people in southern Xinjiang on the basis of my dying old man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In fact, he could not see that the great wizard was weak, but he did not expect to get to this point. But Xiaobai suddenly said, &ldquo;great wizard, you just said that you must return the five sacred vessels to the ancient cave together, so that the beast demon can be revived, right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The great wizard nodded and said, &ldquo;good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaobai said: &ldquo;in this case, even if one of the sacred vessels is lost among the Miao people, and there are four others, you don&rsquo;t have to worry too much&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two, two!&rdquo; Suddenly the great wizard interrupted, and then a violent cough came out of his mouth.</p>
<p>Xiaobai was stunned for a moment and said, &ldquo;what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The great wizard finally calmed down after coughing. With a sigh, he said, &ldquo;there is another sacred jade inlaid on the black staff of our sacred vessel, which was 200 years ago. We Miao people snatched it from the Li people. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah&rdquo; in small white mouth, complexion is a little strange, did not speak.</p>
<p>The great wizard was silent for a moment and said, &ldquo;actually, 200 years ago.</p>
<p>We have found out that things are wrong. We have learned from the secret that the sacred objects of Zhuang, Tu and Gaoshan have been lost in succession for hundreds of years. At that time, only the Miao and Li nationalities still had sacred objects in hand. At that time, among the five ethnic groups, only the magic method in the Miao altar was still a little powerful, so we took the sacred jade from the Li people and kept it in our altar. But in the end, it&rsquo;s still&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>GUI Li and Xiao Bai didn&rsquo;t speak. It was not very glorious to rob people of sacred things.</p>
<p>The great wizard knew this and didn&rsquo;t want to say more about it. He turned his head and looked at the ghost and said, &ldquo;so now the situation is very critical. All the five sacred vessels have been lost. Maybe it&rsquo;s the monster. What&rsquo;s more, the magic used by the demon of Li nationality last night is also the black fire magic of the beast demon before. I, I and I are really worried about&hellip; &quot; He coughed before his voice dropped. The sound of tearing up the voice is exhausted.</p>
<p>He took a deep breath and said slowly, &ldquo;I promised you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The great wizard was so happy that he nodded and said, &ldquo;thank you very much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaobai sat aside and suddenly said, &ldquo;great wizard, what was the name of that witch lady in those days. I really admire her</p>
<p>The great wizard&rsquo;s face changed, sighed, and sat up straight, with reverence on his face</p>
<p>&ldquo;That lady, her name is&rdquo; Linglong &quot;</p>
<p>The darkness of the day, the tangled tall black trees, the bones of human beings and animals that can be seen everywhere in the forest, and the phosphorescence flashing between the dense white bones, are all that the Golden Vase is facing now.</p>
<p>Since she tracked the Lich and entered the mysterious and gloomy world of 100000 mountains, after trekking through two steep mountains, she entered a vast black forest, and this is the scene presented to her.</p>
<p>It was her third day in the dark forest.</p>
<p>The front seems to be endless darkness, like solidification general static, gold bottle son charming face, can not help but also some light anxiety. She walked a step, but there was a slight sound under her feet. Looking down, a white human skull rolled aside on the ground, and did not know how many years he had died here?</p>
<p>The Golden Vase sighs and flicks the skeleton aside with her feet.</p>
<p>Although he had psychological preparation before entering the 100000 mountain, Jin pinger still didn&rsquo;t expect that it would be so weird and dangerous here. There are poisonous miasma everywhere. If you don&rsquo;t say it, you may die if you are not careful. Along the way, she actually met many strange monsters that she had never heard of. In fact, it was not appropriate to say that they were monsters. Most of these things seemed to be derived from some kinds of beasts, such as the fit of tiger and leopard, the integration of pig and bear, etc., but they didn&rsquo;t look like the more intelligent alien race of fish people that she had seen before.</p>
<p>However, although these monsters are ferocious, they are only relative to ordinary people. They are not difficult to deal with for jinpinger, who was born in the Huan sect of the demon sect. So she was quite relaxed along the way. However, the poisonous and miasmal atmosphere everywhere made her worried every day and did not dare to relax for a moment.</p>
<p>And the Lich she was tracking far away did not seem to expect that someone would follow him to the 100000 mountains. So up to now, jinpinger hasn&rsquo;t lost him, but the Dragon beside the Lich is a headache for jinpinger. No matter how she conceals her body, if she gets close to the lich, the dragon, who is extremely sensitive, will be alert. After several times, the Golden Vase will never dare to approach the Lich any more.</p>
<p>Now, with the secret tracing skills of the Huan sect, jinpinger chases the Lich from a distance. Since they entered the black forest one after another, the Lich has never rested for three days and has been shuttling through the forest at the same speed.</p>
<p>Jinpinger&rsquo;s road is quite deep. She can hold on for three days, but she will feel a little sleepy anyway. The Lich in front of her is almost different from that of a human being. She has been walking at the same speed.</p>
<p>The flickering phosphorous fire in the black forest is like the dim light in the dark, and the silent eyes in the dark, watching the woman who breaks in.</p>
<p>Suddenly, there was a roar in the dark. A monster with a pig&rsquo;s head and a bear&rsquo;s body suddenly rushed out from the side and jumped at the golden bottle. The golden bottle Er frowned and flew up. Plain hands in the air brush to swing, a brilliant purple light in the dark flash again and again.</p>
<p>Purple awn blade!</p>
<p>The monster rushed through the place where the Golden Vase had just stood, and then rushed several steps away. Suddenly, a strange long howl came out, and the whole body made a slight dull sound at the same time. &ldquo;Bang&rdquo; a sound, blood spatter, the monster from the middle of the body into two pieces, fell on the ground after two convulsions, then motionless.</p>
<p>The blood flowing out, under the light of phosphorous fire in the black forest, gradually infiltrates into the land and turns into a deep color.</p>
<p>Without waiting for the Golden Vase to fall to the ground, in the darkness ahead, countless wild animals roared. In a moment, the original calm was broken, such as beasts roaring in the sky, and one after another in the dark. In a moment, from behind the flickering phosphorous fire, a pair of eyes, large or small, flickering with fierce light, twinkled in the dark.</p>
<p>The golden vase&rsquo;er breathed deeply, and her face seemed pale.</p>
<p>With a long howl, it suddenly roared down like a huge river. The galloping feet pierced the silence of the darkness and roared and spread gradually. Surround the Golden Vase in the middle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roar&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment, countless monsters rushed out of the darkness and rushed to the thin body.</p>
<p>And the figure of the left to hide in the sky. At the same time, the purple light flickers between the hands, and every time it is waved, there are monsters howling and dying. It&rsquo;s just that there are so many monsters that it will be so crowded in such a big place in a moment that the Golden Vase almost has no place to settle down. She was already flying on the back of all kinds of strange beasts.</p>
<p>However, after a while, more than 20 monsters died under the blade of jinpinger&rsquo;s purple awn, but the pants legs under the feet of jinpinger were torn by the monster several times. In the distance, it seems that there are endless monsters coming out. I really don&rsquo;t know where there are so many monsters in this black forest.</p>
<p>As soon as the Golden Vase sipped her mouth, she knew that she could not entangle with these fierce creatures. She stretched her right foot down on the back of a tiger headed leopard, and the whole person rose up and flew up.</p>
<p>Originally, according to the meaning of the Golden Vase, it was not willing to fly out of the black forest. On the one hand, it was unavoidable to expose the target, and there seemed to be a poisonous miasma above the forest. Secondly, it was more important to track down the Lich in front after flying away from the black forest.</p>
<p>But at this time, I can&rsquo;t care so much. Her body flew straight up. Although the monsters on the ground were fierce, they didn&rsquo;t seem to be able to fly in the sky. Countless monsters crowded on the ground and roared and roared, which was extremely ferocious and really terrible.</p>
<p>Just as the Golden Vase was about to fly to the top of the tall trees, there was a strange sound. All the black trees that had been entangled together suddenly came back to life. There were many black shadows flying down from the top to the bottom. There was a strong smell in the process. I&rsquo;m afraid it was poisonous.</p>
<p>Although the Golden Vase was not confused, it was hard to make a sound in the air, and a purple halo appeared on the top of the head when the purple light flashed. A moment later, those black shadows fell in the air. When they touched the purple light, they only heard the sound of breaking. In an instant, more than a dozen black shadows broke apart and flew in all directions. Looking from afar, it was the black branches, just in the air There was also black juice splashing.</p>
<p>Although jinpinger blocked the strange tree from the sky, she was still beaten down. Countless monsters on the ground were excited and roared. Many of them jumped up and rushed to the body of jinpinger.</p>
<p>Jin pinger&rsquo;s face was pale, her hands were waving, and her purple light was full. In an instant, she moved from top to bottom of her body. Before her body fell to the ground, the creepy &ldquo;aggressive&rdquo; voice had stopped ringing. Within the scope of purple light, more than a dozen monsters&rsquo; bodies burst into pieces, and blood splashed all over the place. Even the golden vase&rsquo;er&rsquo;s body was dyed red.</p>
<p>But the smell of blood seemed to stimulate the monsters around them. In a flash, countless other monsters came up again. The Golden Vase son has already seen sweat on her forehead, and she doesn&rsquo;t hesitate. When the purple awn blade is waving, she blocks a number of monsters. She floats vigorously and rushes forward with all her strength.</p>
<p>At this moment, jinpinger is in a very dangerous situation. There are countless fierce beasts chasing after her, and there are endless strange trees blocking her up and down. She has to fly forward in the middle of the forest with all her strength.</p>
<p>In the black forest, at the moment, there are monsters everywhere, reverberating far away, and the black wind is howling. A hell on earth.</p>
<p>Dodging the sharp claws of wild animals, the Golden Vase cuts off a whole black tree blocking the road with one knife and flies through it. In front of them, there are more monsters and endless black trees like demons</p>
<p>Just fighting and running forward. I don&rsquo;t know how long it took, just when the golden vase&rsquo;er felt that she was gradually unable to do what she wanted. Suddenly, there was a faint light in front of her.</p>
<p>Jinpinger was overjoyed and shocked. The light of purple awn blade explodes, and it cuts down a huge gray wolf that pours on the ground, and the whole person flies there with all his strength.</p>
<p>Shadow dance, such as demons roar, countless black trees from the air down, the Golden Vase is surrounded by purple awns, all the way to see the beast kill animals, meet the tree to cut down the tree, kill the flesh and blood, cry and howl. She killed a passage out of this strange and unpredictable black forest.</p>
<p>Behind her, there were dead animals everywhere, blood and black juice, splashing all over the sky.</p>
<p>When she rushed out of the black forest, the originally charming and moving woman was covered with blood, like a bloody man, which was ferocious and terrifying.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that when she sees her surroundings. Gasping for breath, her face was even more changed. She was standing on a precipice, just a huge rock exposed in the black forest. Under the rocks, the clouds were floating, and the sky was shining, as if there was a strange flow of color light.</p>
<p>The Golden Vase son only looked at it, then knew that those colored clouds and mists were the most poisonous miasma, and the middle man died. And now. In the black forest behind her, the roar of countless monsters rang out again, just behind her.</p>
<p>The golden vase&rsquo;er bit her teeth and tightened her hand holding the purple awn blade again. She turned back, but she felt a roar on her head and could hardly stand. She even shook her body a few times. Since these days, she has not had a good rest. Today, she is facing countless fierce beasts and demon trees. Even if she is an iron man, she has to work hard.</p>
<p>She was shocked. The thought of &ldquo;should I die here?&rdquo; passed through her mind. She could not help but regret that she should not have ventured to chase after the mysterious relationship between the Lich and shangguance. But at the next moment, she suddenly found that although the monsters were still roaring and even standing in her position, there were monsters fluttering and jumping in the dark forest. They were extremely angry, but for some reason, none of them even came out of the black forest.</p>
<p>Perhaps, they do not exist in this world, so they can only live in that strange forest</p>
<p>This discovery made the Golden Vase finally breathe a sigh of relief, and under the light, those black demon trees seemed to solidify in general, and there was no attack on her any more.</p>
<p>Standing on the rock, I felt the mountain breeze with a faint odor blowing from the cliff behind him. As soon as the Golden Vase was soft, she sat down.</p>
<p>The wind moved her clothes, which found that the whole body was covered with dirty animal blood. In any case, the Gold Vase ER was a woman after all. This discovery made her feel sick and quickly bent down to tidy up.</p>
<p>Suddenly, in the black forest, a huge roar roared up, instantly suppressed the sound of countless roaring monsters. Without waiting for the Golden Vase to look up, a huge black shadow leaped out of the black forest and rushed at her.</p>
<p>The Golden Vase son only felt that the whole sky suddenly darkened, and he was covered by the dark shadow. He screamed and subconsciously blocked the purple awn blade on top of his head. The purple light of zimang blade has just begun to appear, and the black shadow has already arrived. A strong force is pouring in like a mountain and a sea. The whole body of the Golden Vase Er has been beaten and flew out. In the air, she has seen the blood gushing from her mouth.</p>
<p>I saw her body tossing in the air. After a few times, she had already flew out of the rock under her feet and fell down. The mountain wind was howling, and her shadow could not be seen in a flash.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roar!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a low roar, the black shadow fell to the ground, and it was the Dragon beside the Lich. At the moment, it could be seen that it had a big mouth and a pair of fierce eyes. However, those monsters in the black forest seemed to be extremely afraid of the dragon. At this time, there was no more movement, and they all ran away quietly.</p>
<p>The black shadow swayed, and the Lich in black slowly floated out of the black forest, crossed the dragon&rsquo;s side and came to the edge of the cliff. The huge dragon slowly followed him.</p>
<p>The Lich leaned over and looked at the bottom of the cliff. There were ripples in the colorful cloud. It was obvious that something had fallen. He turned back, nodded slightly, and patted the dragon&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p>The Dragon roared.</p>
<p>The Lich gave a cold laugh and did not look back. It floated into the black forest. Just as the dragon was about to follow, it stopped again and took a look at the cliff. However, there was silence and nothing happened.</p>
<p>With fierce eyes and bright eyes, the Dragon stopped for a moment, and finally turned its head and ran in the direction of its owner. In the black forest, &ldquo;wordy&rdquo; sounds, then gradually low, until disappeared.</p>
<p>When the mountain wind blows, it rolls up the fine dust on the ground to cover up the remaining traces of blood, as if nothing had ever happened here.</p>
<p>After a long time, suddenly a low sound, the edge of the cliff purple light flash, a figure from the rock under the turn up, it is the Golden Vase.</p>
<p>As soon as she landed, she gasped for breath. Her face was as white as jade, and her mouth was covered with red blood. On the right hand side, purple awn gradually shrinks back to her sleeve. But her eyes looked at her left hand. I don&rsquo;t know when, a strange shaped knife suddenly appeared on her left hand side. The back of the knife was serrated. The shape of the knife was ancient and unsophisticated. The rough and short blade was full of cold light, and two words were clearly engraved</p>
<p>Kill!</p>
<p>The Golden Vase son slowly raised his head and looked at the direction where the Lich and the Dragon left. In the dark forest, there was silence.</p>
<p>She gazed for a long time, as if thinking about something. After a long time, her eyes returned to the strange knife in her hand.</p>
<p>In her eyes, there seems to be a strange light turning quietly, the mountain wind blowing, faintly hear her whispering to herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kill the monk&hellip;&rdquo; (to be continued. )</p>
