<p>I&rsquo;d like to present today&rsquo;s update. By the way, I&rsquo;d like to draw a vote for the &ldquo;starting point&rdquo; 515 fan Festival. Everyone has 8 tickets. I&rsquo;d like to give you some money to vote for!</p>
<p>In Xiangyun mountain, Bai Xiaochun, as a foreign disciple, lived a very moist life. He was very satisfied with everything except the delicious food in the fire kitchen.</p>
<p>Both the speed of his practice and the research on plants and plants make him feel that his life is very full, but occasionally he feels bored. His yard is a bit remote, and there are no people around him who even speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are friars so lonely?&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun raised his head with emotion and stood in the yard, looking at the sky, looking at a young mature appearance.</p>
<p>Now the autumn wind has gone and the snow is falling. With the sudden drop of temperature, some snowflakes can be seen occasionally between heaven and earth. The Lingdong bamboo in the yard is growing stronger and stronger when the cold winter comes. Now the height has surpassed Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s height, and it is green, becoming a scene of spring in this cold winter.</p>
<p>It has been more than a month since he became the first one in the stone tablet of plants and trees. It is just that the difficulty of the second chapter is beyond his expectation. The speed of research is slower. The most important thing is that although Zhou Xinqi has never taken back the first tablet, Bai Xiaochun will feel pressure when he thinks about the incomplete pieces of grass and trees left at the end of the trial.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My high reputation, can&rsquo;t let Zhou Xinqi that little lady to surpass.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun secretly made up his mind. He had not finished the dream of being a tortoise pharmacist when he was in the spotlight. So he felt that he had to work harder.</p>
<p>Although the progress of the second chapter of vegetation is slow, his practice of immortality and eternal life is about to reach a small week.</p>
<p>The pain of each practice is increasing, but Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s persistence in the four words of immortality and immortality has made him stick to it till now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are still three days. Three days later, according to the saying of immortal longevity, it will be a complete little Sunday. Bai Xiaochun took a deep breath and bit his teeth. While studying vegetation, he ran back and forth in the courtyard.</p>
<p>Soon, three days later, when the third day of dusk, the sky floated snow, making lingxizong snow wrapped.</p>
<p>Suddenly, his body suddenly stopped and disappeared in the moment.</p>
<p>Bursts of heat burst out suddenly, and after constantly emerging in his body, all condensed on the skin, making the skin hot, like a brand iron just out of the furnace.</p>
<p>Before the snowflake fell on him, it immediately melted, and immediately became the white air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s done!&rdquo; Although Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s mouth was dry and hot, he was surprised. He looked down at his body and immediately saw some black light in his skin. After a circle, the light gradually dissipated.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun stabbed his arm with his right hand, which made his eyes shine. Then he moved his body again. He obviously found that his speed seemed to be faster. So he rushed forward, and with a whoosh, he appeared several feet away.</p>
<p>This speed is more than twice as fast as before. Seeing that the effect is so obvious, Bai Xiaochun is more happy and tries for a long time and is quite satisfied.</p>
<p>Therefore, without hesitation, he continued to practice according to the formula of immortal longevity. This is a method of closing the mouth and nose and trying to breathe with the body. One breath and one breath is considered as a small cycle. The requirement is to carry out 9981 times a day, lasting for 9981 days, which can be regarded as a small week.</p>
<p>If you can adhere to it, then with the previous body pain of the small Sunday, it is not dead skin of small into!</p>
<p>After practicing for a long time, Bai Xiaochun slowly found the law and stood in the yard to breathe. However, after he had managed to complete a small cycle, his body lost a circle to the naked eye.</p>
<p>At the same time, the gust of hunger appeared, which made Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s stomach coo. He ignored it and continued to breathe like this. Gradually, his body became thinner and thinner. Finally, after he finished his 15th breath, his body looked like skin and bone.</p>
<p>As if all the nutrients were taken away, his skin, at this moment, looked more tenacious.</p>
<p>But Bai Xiaochun couldn&rsquo;t help it. When he opened his eyes, he was dizzy and his eyes were almost green. He felt like an elephant in front of him could be swallowed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m starving to death!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun swallows hard, her eyes are bright, and she cuts everywhere. But there is nothing to eat around. The bamboo is green and seems delicious.</p>
<p>He tried to hold back, but the feeling of hunger made him come to the side of Lingdong bamboo with a whoosh and took a big bite towards it.</p>
<p>After swallowing, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s face suddenly twisted. The bitter taste made him shiver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too hard&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to eat&hellip;&rdquo; At this moment, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s yearning for the fire kitchen room was so strong that he was hungry. Even though he was so big, he was not so hungry. At the moment, he was dizzy, his eyes were more and more green, and he was short of breath. His body suddenly rushed out and directly ran out of the yard.</p>
<p>Along the mountain road, the speed is very fast. The other disciples who meet on the way only feel a wind blowing by, and they are surprised to see Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s back.</p>
<p>All the way down the mountain, rushed into the miscellaneous service area, went straight to the fire kitchen, and even didn&rsquo;t want to waste the time of opening the door, so the whole person directly jumped in.</p>
<p>At the moment, the fire kitchen is cooking. After Zhang daphou and heisanpang have left, Huang Er Pang becomes the head here. When he is pouring rice soup, a gust of wind blows, and the bowl in front of him is gone. Under the rice soup, Bai Xiaochun, with a big mouth, appears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah?&rdquo; Huang sanpang is startled, and the other fat men are also stunned. After seeing that it is Bai Xiaochun, before they can speak, Bai Xiaochun takes up a big pot with green eyes and drinks it all. It seems that she still feels full. She goes straight into a pot, and the rice soup in the pot decreases in an instant</p>
<p>One, two, three Bai Xiaochun drank more than 100 pots of soup on his face. His body was like a bottomless pit, but he didn&rsquo;t feel any support at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hungry, no, I&rsquo;m still hungry I want meat Bai Xiaochun was in a hurry and looked around. At the first sight, he saw several fat elder martial brothers like meat mountain, swallowing a mouthful of saliva.</p>
<p>The fat people in the fire kitchen are staring at Bai Xiaochun. They have seen the hungry, but they have never seen the one who is hungry like this. This is Bai Xiaochun. This is clearly a starving ghost.</p>
<p>Especially when he found that Bai Xiaochun was staring at himself and others to swallow saliva, Huang sanpang and others immediately went mad and quickly backed back. Huang sanchou roared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jiupang, there is spiritual food for the elder in the kitchen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Bai Xiaochun heard this, the light of her eyes flashed suddenly, and her body rushed directly into the kitchen.</p>
<p>Huang San Pang and others outside looked at each other and took a breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See, this is what happens when you become a disciple of a foreign school. I&rsquo;m starving like this&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kill us, and we will not become disciples of other schools!&rdquo; Several other fat men have made up their minds and sympathize with Bai Xiaochun here.</p>
<p>This meal, Bai Xiaochun forced to endure. According to the six true words of Huo Zao Fang, she only ate the corners and didn&rsquo;t eat all of them. Once the rules were broken, those elder martial brothers in huozaofang would be harmed. Bai Xiaochun could not do such a thing.</p>
<p>After drinking the soup and eating the corner, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s hunger was finally a little less and could be tolerated for a short time. Then he came out. He wanted to cry without tears. He felt that the immortal longevity work was too terrible. Although it was no longer painful, the feeling of hunger was even more maddening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Second elder martial brother&hellip;&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun looks at Huang Er Pang.</p>
<p>Huang Er Pang sees that Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s eyes return to normal, and then he puts them down. He dares to walk up to Bai Xiaochun and pat him on the shoulder with a sympathetic look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, younger martial brother. If it&rsquo;s a big deal, we&rsquo;ll prepare some more for elder Zhou. You can see that you are hungry like this. Alas, you can come back to make up for it later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun was moved by this speech. He bit his teeth and decided to come back less in the future. Otherwise, if he didn&rsquo;t hold back one day, a fire stove would not be able to support him</p>
<p>With the help of Huang Er Pang and others, Bai Xiaochun walks up Xiangyun mountain with a sigh. The direct beauty and comfort dissipate in an instant, and is replaced by despair. He is afraid that he will be starved to death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if Lingxi sect had any disciples who died of starvation before me. I don&rsquo;t want to be the first one.&rdquo; When Bai Xiaochun was thinking of a way to solve the problem of eating for a long time, he suddenly heard the crow of chickens not far away.</p>
<p>At the moment of hearing the crow, Bai Xiaochun turned her head slowly, staring at the direction of the crow. Her eyes were straight and her stomach began to coo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chicken&hellip;&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun looked around and found that no one was paying attention to himself. His body swayed and went straight into the grass. His speed was so fast that he disappeared like a weasel.</p>
<p>A moment later, Bai Xiaochun crouched down outside the fence in Xiangyun mountain, where the birds were specially raised. Bai Xiaochun was looking at a group of arrogant people walking up and down in the fence. The tail had tricolor feathers, and the head was full of calf sized chickens. His eyes were bright and he didn&rsquo;t know how many saliva he swallowed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meat&hellip;&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun here, sent out a strange laugh, that smile sounds, especially the person.</p>
<hr>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have a good rest last night</p>
<p>[it&rsquo;s about to be 515 soon. I hope it can continue to impact the 515 red envelope list. On May 15, the red envelope rain will give back to readers and publicity works. A piece is also love, must be better! ]</p>
