<p>Bai Xiaochun suddenly opened her eyes and was full of 3000 spirit stones Looking at Hou Xiaomei, his eyes are shining. At this moment, how much he wants to go up and hold Hou Xiaomei and give her 3000 thumbs</p>
<p>Tell her, you are good!</p>
<p>All the people in the auction house were in a state of uproar at such a high price. After Hou Xiaomei&rsquo;s voice came out, they all stayed for a moment. They all looked at Hou Xiaomei and saw a girl with a small waist and a big chest. She was white and tender, delicate and delicate, and looked proud, just like a little pepper.</p>
<p>She raised her chin and looked at Zhou Xinqi. She was afraid of who I was from Xiuzhen family and I was rich. Instead of making people feel disgusted, she felt that Hou Xiaomei was cute.</p>
<p>Many people smile in their eyes, and some are even more amazing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;3100 spirit stones!&rdquo; Zhou Xinqi calmly opened her mouth, and her face was cold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The little tortoise is very important to me, but my Hou Xiaomei will buy any pill for the little turtle at all costs. Hum, I have 4000 spirit stones. I belong to Xiuzhen family, and some of them are spirit stones.&rdquo; She emphasized the last sentence. Hou Yunfei was looking down at the moment, embarrassed and worried at the bottom of her heart. His sister, somehow, worshipped the little turtle, which has reached the level of fanaticism in recent years</p>
<p>There are admirers of Zhou Xinqi all around. Some of them can&rsquo;t see it any more. Many people say that Hou Xiaomei has offered such a price for a second-class elixir, which is really a failure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Ben is a spirit stone. Do you bite me?&rdquo; Hou Xiaomei heard these words, immediately not happy, holding a small chest, pinching a small waist, crisp voice retort.</p>
<p>Looking at this scene on the balcony, Bai Xiaochun felt that she had led Hou Xiaomei from the crooked road to the right path, how correct it was.</p>
<p>Zhou Xinqi frowned. She didn&rsquo;t have so many spirit stones. Now she was silent for a long time, sighed and could only give up.</p>
<p>When Hou Xiaomei saw that Zhou Xinqi didn&rsquo;t make an offer, she was surprised. She actually pretended to be a big spirit stone. Naturally, she didn&rsquo;t have such a large amount of spirit stone. She just said that intentionally at the moment. In front of so many people, the ancestor couldn&rsquo;t help but admit it.</p>
<p>Finally, in Hou Xiaomei&rsquo;s complacency, this elixir of refining spirit for three times was successfully bought by her.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun is satisfied and admires Hou Xiaomei in the distance. She coughs and thinks that since Hou Xiaomei adores herself so much, it would be wrong for her not to tell her real identity.</p>
<p>So he made up his mind. Seeing that the first day&rsquo;s auction was coming to an end, he hurried out to show his identity in front of everyone.</p>
<p>In the backstage of the auction house, the ancestors of several Xiuzhen families were also here, responsible for the protection here. One of the middle-aged men coughed and laughed bitterly at his companions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That My granddaughter&rsquo;s character is mischievous, which makes everyone laugh He said, wry smile out of the equivalent spirit stone, put aside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pure heart.&rdquo; The crowd laughed.</p>
<p>At the end of the first day&rsquo;s auction, the auction usually lasts for several days. Bai Xiaochun doesn&rsquo;t intend to continue to come. His pills have been sold out. At the moment, he is excited and goes out quickly. When he arrives at the door, he stands there and looks at the crowd from the auction house.</p>
<p>These people are all disciples of the school, one by one are excited to talk about the purple Qi rising elixir just now.</p>
<p>Soon, Bai Xiaochun saw Zhou Xinqi, and his encouragement and appreciation appeared in the tower, as if persuading the other party not to be discouraged. When he was about to step forward, his eyes made Zhou Xinqi stunned and quickly avoided. Before Bai Xiaochun approached, he turned into a Changhong.</p>
<p>When Bai Xiaochun is depressed, the voice of surprise comes from behind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little brother chun!&rdquo; Hou Xiaomei looks happy, jumping out of the crowd, twisting her waist to Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s side. Hou Yunfei smiles when she sees her.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun takes back her eyes to look at Zhou Xinqi&rsquo;s figure. She looks at Hou Xiaomei with admiration in her eyes. She looks like an elder and pats Hou Xiaomei&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little sister Chun, it&rsquo;s good. I&rsquo;ll be so aggressive when I buy things in the future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hou Xiaomei immediately blushed, and then thought of what, happy to take out that purple Qi Sheng Lingdan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little pure brother, look, this is the pill made by little turtle. I bought it. Do you want it or not? I will give it to you. Didn&rsquo;t you say that you adore Little Turtle most, I bought it for you specially.&rdquo; Her eyes showed a thrilling look, and put the pill in front of Bai Xiaochun. Her face was full of expectation, as if in her world, there was only Bai Xiaochun at the moment.</p>
<p>Hou Yunfei on one side saw this scene, his eyes were soft and his smile was silent.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun was stunned. He didn&rsquo;t expect that the other party had bought the pill. He was moved because of himself. Seeing that there were many people around him, he took a deep breath and showed his awe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little sister, I want to tell you a big secret!&rdquo; White small pure eyes show firm, open mouth, a master lonely appearance, oil ran up.</p>
<p>He has the ability to change at any time.</p>
<p>Hou Xiaomei a Leng, around Hou Yunfei also surprised for a while, looking at Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the secret?&rdquo; Hou Xiaomei showed a look of listening and asked curiously.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun coughed hard, raised his chin and swung his sleeve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I, Bai Xiaochun, is the one who moves the world, is mysterious, frightens the world and sobs ghosts and gods Great Mr. tortoise Bai Xiaochun looked up and laughed. After he said this sentence, he was filled with emotion in his heart. He had been holding it in his mouth for several years. Now he can finally say it. He said it in front of Hou Xiaomei, who adores him most. Especially, there are many people in the four weeks. This is what attracts the attention of the public.</p>
<p>The most important thing is that he thinks that we can&rsquo;t let the people who worship him never know that the idol is around! Bai Xiaochun looks up at the white clouds in the sky. She looks aloof, but her ears stand up, waiting for the exclamation of Hou Xiaomei and the people around her.</p>
<p>The bottom of my heart has already thought well, what kind of words should I say in a moment&rsquo;s exclamation.</p>
<p>But after waiting for a long time, there was no sound coming. All of a sudden, Bai Xiaochun was surprised. She could not help but take back her eyes to look at the clouds in the sky, aiming at Hou Xiaomei and Hou Yunfei.</p>
<p>Hou Xiaomei was stunned, and Hou Yunfei was also stunned. They all looked at Bai Xiaochun foolishly. The disciples who came out of the auction house all looked strange.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little tortoise, who is indifferent to fame and wealth, is like a white cloud in the sky. Uncle Bai actually claims to be a little turtle? Ha ha Let&rsquo;s go. Let&rsquo;s go. &quot;</p>
<p>White small pure complexion immediately ugly, was about to explain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Xiaochun, are you ok?&rdquo; Hou Yunfei was worried and touched Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun said anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah? OK, OK, you are you are&hellip; &quot; Hou Yunfei looks strange and nods quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little brother chun, you have told me before that little turtle is like a white cloud in the sky, who is indifferent to fame and wealth In fact, in my heart, you and the little turtle are the same height, you don&rsquo;t have to fake the little turtle&hellip; &quot; Hou Xiaomei looks at Bai Xiaochun and says softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really&hellip;&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun hasn&rsquo;t finished, Hou Yunfei on one side looks solemn and grabs Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Xiaochun, we believe it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really&hellip;&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun opened his eyes and just opened his mouth. Hou Yunfei looked more serious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Xiaochun, we really believe it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&hellip;&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun was at a loss in his eyes. He only felt that he was disillusioned. He could not explain clearly how to explain it. The huge gap between ideal and reality made him turn around in a daze and walk away in a daze. He did not know how to return to his ancestral home.</p>
<p>In the yard, he looked at the sky, looking sad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m really the turtle master&hellip;&rdquo; He felt aggrieved, he felt his dream, he wanted to speak out the pride of identity in the eyes of the public, at the moment all broken.</p>
<p>But he also found out the problem. He boasted too much about the little turtle these years So that everyone&rsquo;s mind, the image of the little turtle has been extraordinary.</p>
<p>To be exact, with the unremitting efforts of him and Hou Xiaomei, the little turtle has been deified</p>
<p>After a while, he was not reconciled and went to find Xu Baocai. In front of Xu Baocai, he said his identity seriously. Xu Baocai was stunned He nodded and said I believed it.</p>
<p>With a sad face, Bai Xiaochun went back to the yard and stayed again.</p>
<p>Until a few days later, sun came to visit. Bai Xiaochun was pleasantly surprised and felt that she had grasped the hope. Sun Chen knew that the pill was sent by herself.</p>
<p>But before he could open his mouth, Sun Chen sent out enough spirit stones, and then he bowed to Bai Xiaochun with his fist clasping. He looked solemn and dignified.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brother Bai, I didn&rsquo;t know that the pill was actually made by Tianjiao of your family. My ancestors were surprised. Now, the only person in the clan who can contact with Tianjiao must be brother Bai, otherwise you won&rsquo;t have this pill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please tell Tianjiao, my sun family, that we hope to have a long-term friendship with him. If there are pills to deal with in the future, we will do our best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brother Bai, please tell this Tianjiao that he is indifferent to fame and wealth. He does not care about fame and wealth. He is like a cloud in the sky and pursues the ultimate medicine. These people will surely fly into the sky in the future. My sun family is willing to deal with common affairs for him.&rdquo; Sun Chen bowed his fist deeply. When he looked up, he saw that Bai Xiaochun was in a daze. After waiting for a moment, he did not see Bai Xiaochun. After hesitation, he held his fist again and left.</p>
<p>At the bottom of my heart, Bai Xiaochun is really in a special position in Lingxi sect. The mysterious Tianjiao that nobody knows actually has friendship with him.</p>
<p>In his mind, he never thought that Bai Xiaochun was a little tortoise, and his personality was too different. For the little turtle, not only the disciples of Lingxi sect knew it, but also the Xiuzhen family outside. After all the investigation, the conclusion of his personality was almost the same as what Zhou Xinqi thought.</p>
<p>Until the bright moon hung high, Bai Xiaochun came back to his senses. He sighed and jumped up. He stood on the bamboo in the yard with his hands on his back. He looked up at the stars with a strange look. The mountain wind lifted his black and blew his clothes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect that in my bones, I was indifferent to fame and wealth, as elegant as the clouds in the sky. Alas, it&rsquo;s my fault that I cover up so well. Sometimes, excellence is also a kind of loneliness.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun small sleeve a shake, moonlight, his figure really had a master lonely feeling.</p>
