      <p>See blue clouds again.</p>
<p>When Zhang Xiaofan saw Qingyun Mountain again, it was several months since he went down with Lu Xueqi, Qi Hao and Zeng Shushu last time.</p>
<p>The mountain, which is still towering and straight into the cloud, is still ethereal and solemn, but Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s situation has completely changed.</p>
<p>After discussing with Taoist Cangsong and xiaoyicai, Zhang Xiaofan was temporarily taken back to dazhufeng by Tian, and Taoist Cangsong and xiaoyicai went back to report to Taoist XuanZhen, the leader, in detail, before making a decision.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan, however, lost the fire staff and was unable to resist the air all the way, so song Daren, the elder martial brother, took him back with him all the time.</p>
<p>Dazhu peak rises into the clouds, surrounded by cliffs. Zhang Xiaofan, who lost his firebrand, seems to be under house arrest at the moment.</p>
<p>After a flash of light, Dazhu peak finally returned to Dazhu peak, which had been away for a long time.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan came down from the ten tiger immortal sword of the big elder martial brother who stopped steadily. He stood silently. Tian could not easily see him even without looking at him. His face was so ugly that he went back to &ldquo;Shoujing hall&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Wu Dayi and others, who came up to meet them and stayed on Dazhu peak, were stunned for a while, and all looked at Su Ru and song Daren in bewilderment.</p>
<p>Su Ru sighed slightly and shook her head. She didn&rsquo;t have the heart to talk. She turned to song Daren and said, &ldquo;Daren, here you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren responds in a hurry.</p>
<p>Su Ru turned to look at Zhang Xiaofan, who was standing beside without saying a word, and saw that his face was haggard. In the past few days, he had lost a lot of weight. He could not bear to take a step subconsciously, but then he stopped again, shook his head and sighed, and turned around. Tian ling&rsquo;er turns to look at Zhang Xiaofan, and then follows his mother without saying a word.</p>
<p>Song Daren gave a dry smile with a strange look. He said to Zhang Xiaofan, &ldquo;little younger martial brother, since we have come back, you can go back to your room to have a rest! But you You&rsquo;d better not walk around. &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan looks up. Nodding slowly, he said: &ldquo;elder martial brother, I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said that he walked alone to the residence of the disciples of dazhufeng, and he didn&rsquo;t go far, so he heard a low voice conversation behind him. Obviously, Wu Dayi and others are asking song Daren and Du Bishu.</p>
<p>Although I can&rsquo;t see it, the invisible eyes behind me seem to stab Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s back like needles.</p>
<p>When he was not far away, suddenly there were two happy barks on the bamboo peak. Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s heart moved, looked up and looked forward, and couldn&rsquo;t help but stay for a while. Only a long time no see of the little grey monkey riding on the back of the big dog rhubarb with his mouth cracked, his hands grasping the bright fur of the big yellow, and rhubarb spit out half of his tongue. All the way, barking loudly and excitedly, rushed over.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan suddenly felt the heat in his eyes, and even his body trembled slightly.</p>
<p>Soon, rhubarb ran to Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s body, and Xiaohui &ldquo;squeaked&rdquo; and &ldquo;whooshed&rdquo; on Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s shoulder. He laughed happily, and his claws were habitually put on Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s head and touched everywhere. As for rhubarb, Zhang Xiaofan is also very intimate. A big dog head keeps rubbing around Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s feet.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s missing the bones made by Zhang Xiaofan again?</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was excited and squatted down. Touch the head of rhubarb gently with your hand. Rhubarb murmured twice. Two ears fell down obediently and rubbed against the palm of Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>And the little ash chuckled. The tail swings across and around, clinging to Zhang Xiaofan.</p>
<p>Standing in the distance, Wu Dayi mumbled two sentences and whispered, &ldquo;I have taken good care of these two beasts for several months. I have never been so intimate with them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Soon, in the eyes of all. Zhang Xiaofan stood up and walked to his residence. Xiaohui sat on his shoulder, and rhubarb followed him.</p>
<p>As if only at this moment, Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s figure does not seem so lonely.</p>
<p>In the distance at the foot of Qingyun Mountain, Biyao and Youji, a mysterious woman in black, stand side by side, looking at the mountain hidden in the deep clouds.</p>
<p>Biyao&rsquo;s face was slightly pale, her eyebrows were wrinkled, and she looked haggard and trance. After staring for a long time, he said slowly, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how he is now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The black gauze on Youji&rsquo;s face moved slightly. She turned around and looked at the girl suffering from love. She said softly, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s OK, Biyao. Don&rsquo;t think too much about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biyao bit her lips, and suddenly said, &ldquo;where&rsquo;s my father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>You Ji said: &ldquo;the LORD went to the city of Heyang today to meet the old monster of the newly arrived ten thousand poison gate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What,&rdquo; said Biyao, startled, &ldquo;is poison coming?&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a faint smile, Youji said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not just him. I heard privately that in recent days, even the leader of Changsheng hall and Hehuan sect will come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biyao&rsquo;s surprise was even worse. After a while, she said, &ldquo;how could this happen? I know that dad has already transferred the main force of the king of ghosts to the nearby Qingyun Mountain. If these three masters come, their master will surely come along. Then, is it not our four biggest&hellip; No, it&rsquo;s just that the strength of the church is completely concentrated here? &quot;</p>
<p>Youji&rsquo;s face is hidden behind her black veil, and she can&rsquo;t see what expression it is, but only listening to her voice, she is still calm and calm, and calmly says, &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biyao suddenly lowered her head, and after a long time, slowly said: &ldquo;so, my father&rsquo;s main purpose here is not to save Zhang Xiaofan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You Ji said lightly: &ldquo;don&rsquo;t think about it, Biyao. The patriarch says everything. You are his only daughter. He won&rsquo;t cheat you. As for this time, your father strongly advocated that for the humiliation of one hundred years ago, the four sect leaders swore under the throne of the Ming Dynasty to attack Qingyun unprepared. &quot;</p>
<p>After a moment&rsquo;s silence, Biyao said: &ldquo;if this war is successful, Dad&rsquo;s reputation in the holy religion will naturally soar. Even if he fails, he has a good reputation of being shameful for his predecessors. But&hellip; &quot; She suddenly raised her voice and looked excited. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t care about it, I don&rsquo;t want to worry about it. I just want Zhang Xiaofan to be good, not to be&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Baguio!&rdquo; You Ji suddenly drinks, and Biyao is stunned. After looking at her, she finally doesn&rsquo;t say anything more. She turns her head to look at the remote, misty white clouds, and looks silly for a while.</p>
<p>In a secluded mansion in Heyang City, the ghost king and the green dragon walk in slowly. Along the way, someone respectfully led in and walked straight in.</p>
<p>This house is naturally the stronghold of the ten thousand poisons gate in Heyang city. That is to say, the head of the ten thousand poisons gate today. Poison God, the oldest of the four sects of demon sect, came here.</p>
<p>A hundred years ago, the devil cult and the right way fought in Qingyun Mountain. What they killed was darkness, but in the end, the devil cult still lost. After that. The spirit of the demon sect is greatly damaged. Three of the four sects have changed their heads. At that time, the ghost King took over as the leader of the ghost King sect.</p>
<p>But among the various sects, only the old monster poison God of the ten thousand poisons sect survived. However, in recent years, it has also been against the arrogant style of that year. Even in the demon sect, the ten thousand poisons sect has unexpectedly kept a low profile. Ordinary disciples can&rsquo;t see the old monster.</p>
<p>Upon reading this, Qinglong could not help frowning. The title of poison God has been resounding in the demon sect for hundreds of years. When he was still following the incoming ghost king to fight the world, the poison God was a powerful general in the ten thousand poisons sect. Later, he took over the position of the leader of the ten thousand poisons sect. In the internal dispute of the demon sect, he had a fierce fight with the ghost King sect. How many Liang Zi were formed in the dark?</p>
<p>I just didn&rsquo;t expect to work with this old monster when things changed.</p>
<p>Green Dragon hasn&rsquo;t seen poison God for nearly a hundred years. I&rsquo;m curious. I don&rsquo;t know what the poison God has become these years? In terms of age, the old monster is only about 500 years old.</p>
<p>Think about it. He suddenly moved in his heart and looked to the ghost king who was walking in the front half of his body. There was a light smile on his face, and his expression seemed to be very relaxed. However, he could not guess what he was thinking in his heart?</p>
<p>Walk all the way through the courtyard. When I entered the inner hall, there was silence all around. I couldn&rsquo;t see a figure. The place where this high-ranking person lived was unexpectedly cold.</p>
<p>Soon, they saw eight men in uniform yellow and brown clothes standing at the entrance of a seemingly ordinary bungalow in front of them, and the guide also took them to the house. It seems that poison God should be in this house.</p>
<p>When they got close to each other, the eight men bowed down to the ghost king to salute. Obviously, the ghost king, as the patriarch of one of the four major sects of the demon sect, has a very high position in the demon sect. However, the ghost king did not have any proud color. He nodded to the crowd and smiled casually. Then he went in with Qinglong.</p>
<p>In this room, there are windows on both the East and the west, and the light shines in. The room is very bright, and there is no such feeling that the people of the world&rsquo;s legendary demon sect have been staying in the dark.</p>
<p>As for the furnishings, they are even simpler. In the middle of the huge room, there was only one table and several chairs. Besides, there was a reclining chair beside the table. An old man with white hair and snow was lying on it with his eyes closed. There was a young man in his early twenties, who was sitting beside him. He was playing with the tea set on the table. The fragrance of the tea came from time to time.</p>
<p>How to look at it, it&rsquo;s like a peaceful picture of grandparents and grandchildren resting, where there is a trace of evil spirit!</p>
<p>The ghost King smiled and walked past. The old man heard the footsteps, opened his eyes and looked at the ghost king. He smiled and said, &ldquo;you are here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost king said with a smile, &ldquo;old master, when the temple was gone, it was long time ago. How is your health?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man is naturally the God of evil. He seems to smile bitterly and says, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s old and useless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he said, he didn&rsquo;t want to talk about this topic again. He turned away and said: &ldquo;brother ghost king, now you are already a sect leader of the ghost King clan. You have the same identity with me. If you don&rsquo;t dislike me, just call me brother. Don&rsquo;t call me elder. I can&rsquo;t bear it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost King laughed and looked relaxed. He sat down on the other side of the table and said to the poison God, &ldquo;old master, you are wrong. Who knows that you are respected and respected. We still expect you to preside over this event!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poison God&rsquo;s face as if a Zheng, immediately shook his head and said: &ldquo;no, No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost king was waiting to say something. The young man on the opposite table had already made two cups of tea. At this time, he brought it over and said in a light way: &ldquo;Lord, green dragon envoy, please use tea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost king and the green dragon reached out and took over. The ghost king looked at him a few more times. He saw that the young man had beautiful eyes, but his face was pale. But he was able to accompany the poison God here. Naturally, he had a lot to do with the poison God.</p>
<p>The ghost king then turned to the poison God and said, &ldquo;this is&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poison God said with a smile: &ldquo;he is the closed disciple that I received ten years ago. His name is Qin Wuyan. When I saw that he was qualified, I accepted him. Wuyan, I haven&rsquo;t met these two elders. They are very famous figures in our holy religion. If they can take care of you in the future, it&rsquo;s better than going to a hundred years of hard work. &quot;</p>
<p>Qin Wuyan lowered his head slightly, his face was not proud or shy, even his voice did not change. Still calm and gentle, he said softly, &ldquo;I have seen the patriarch and the emissary. Just now I didn&rsquo;t know the etiquette. Please don&rsquo;t blame me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost King smiled and shook his hand. Qinglong also said with a smile: &ldquo;this little brother can enter the seat of the elder generation of poison God. There is no future, no future!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The God of poison laughed and said to them, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t blame children for their ignorance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost King shook his hand and said with a smile, &ldquo;where is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a pause, he said again, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m here today. I really want to invite you to preside over the overall situation. Together, the four great sects of our country will wash away the shame of the defeat of Qingyun and the humiliation of the temple. &quot;</p>
<p>The poison God was silent for a moment. His face seemed a little bleak, and he said: &ldquo;brother, I&rsquo;m half disabled, and I can&rsquo;t use it very much. This time, our four major sects secretly discussed the siege of Qingyun. Naturally, I can&rsquo;t fall behind people. Otherwise, I&rsquo;m sorry for the virgin of Youming and the two saints of Tiansha and Mingwang, and I&rsquo;m even more sorry for the ancestors of the church. Just preside over the overall situation! I don&rsquo;t think other people can sit at all except you, brother! &quot;</p>
<p>The ghost King frowned, shook his head and said: &ldquo;you are too flattering, elder. I am among the four masters. The most junior, how to play? Come on! When the &ldquo;yuyangzi&rdquo; of Changsheng hall and the &ldquo;Sanmiao Fairy&rdquo; of Hehuan sect arrive, let&rsquo;s discuss them together! &quot;</p>
<p>The poison God pondered for a while and said: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s good to do so. They should be here in these days, and we will get together again. This time, we must ask Qingyun gate for a refund of the humiliation of the church over the past hundred years. &quot;</p>
<p>The ghost King smiled and sat here for a while, chatting. Then I left with Qinglong. And the God of poison did not keep it, but sent people to see them off.</p>
<p>After leaving the poison God&rsquo;s residence, the ghost king and Qinglong joined the crowd in Heyang city.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ghost king suddenly sneers, way:&rdquo; this old monster, as expected more and more difficult to deal with</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a strange saying, but Qinglong seems to know what he means, and nodded: &ldquo;yes, when our ghost King clan fought with Wandu sect three hundred years ago, the old monster was the most fierce impulse, and always rushed to the front. Even if the big battle with Qingyun hundred years ago, it was also the leader of Wandu sect. It seems that he lost a lot of energy in that disastrous defeat. &quot;</p>
<p>The ghost King shook his head and said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not to kill energy, it&rsquo;s to gain ability. After that battle, the old monster seemed to wake up. All of a sudden, the whole person&rsquo;s temper changed. In the past hundred years, except for our ghost King clan, the one with the fastest strength recovery is the ten thousand poison sect. But he won&rsquo;t take this seat, but it&rsquo;s very troublesome! &quot;</p>
<p>After that, the ghost King frowned and said lightly: &ldquo;well, anyway, we have to wait for those two people to come to discuss major issues. Let&rsquo;s wait for a few days first! Well, by the way, where&rsquo;s Baguio? It&rsquo;s like I haven&rsquo;t seen her all day. &quot;</p>
<p>Qinglong said: &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t see it either, but you Ji has been with her all the time. It shouldn&rsquo;t happen. You can rest assured.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost King shook his head and sighed softly. He said nothing more.</p>
<p>After seeing the ghost king and the green dragon disappear, the poison God, who had been peaceful and even had a kind look, gradually became gloomy, but he didn&rsquo;t say anything for a long time.</p>
<p>As for the young man next to him, he seems to be even more eccentric. The poison God doesn&rsquo;t talk to him, and he enjoys himself. He is patiently brewing tea on the table without any impatient look.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t know for a long time, poison god suddenly issued a sigh, way: &ldquo;the Yangtze River behind the waves push forward!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man called Qin Wuyan turned around, looked at the poison God and said: &ldquo;Oh! Is that humane? &quot;</p>
<p>The God of poison snorted and said: &ldquo;his practice of Taoism is naturally very high, but no matter how high the practice is, we are not afraid of him, but this man&rsquo;s city is too deep, you must be careful in the future!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Qin Wuyan smiled a little, but his tone was still so peaceful. He said, &ldquo;I know, Shifu.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The poison God looked at him, and suddenly sighed, &ldquo;if your elder martial brothers who are not good at making things can have your qualifications, why should I endure these many years?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Qin Wuyan was praised by the God of poison, but he didn&rsquo;t feel satisfied. He said lightly: &ldquo;several senior brothers are doing their best for you, Shifu.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The poison God snorted, suddenly reached out his hand and lifted the blanket on his leg. He got off the chair and stood up. Then he saw that he was quite tall, with straight back. Where was he a little sick? It seems that all the actions just now are for deceiving the ghost king and the green dragon.</p>
<p>Poison God walked back and forth in the middle of the room, but Qin Wuyan seemed to be much quieter than his master, and only the footsteps of poison God echoed in the room.</p>
<p>At this time, suddenly, a strange sound sounded from Qin Wuyan&rsquo;s side, which seemed to be the shrill sound of cicadas in summer.</p>
<p>As soon as poison God&rsquo;s face changed, he looked around.</p>
<p>Qin Wuyan took out a small yellow box from under the chair, a foot square, and the strange sound came from here.</p>
<p>Poison God walked over, reached out and opened the lid gently. In front of the two of them, on the yellow soft silk in the box, there was a colorful centipede lying on his stomach. But the most strange part was that the tail of the centipede had seven branches.</p>
<p>At the moment, if Zhang Xiaofan saw this thing, he would be shocked, because he had seen it when he was a child, which was one of the most poisonous &ldquo;seven tailed centipedes&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Qin Wuyan frowned and said, &ldquo;since we came to the Qingyun Mountain, Xiaoqi seems to be upset. It seems that he has been stimulated by something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poison God looked at the seven tailed centipede carefully, then took out a lilac pill from his bosom, put it into the box, and then covered the box. Soon, the strange sound from the box began to fade away.</p>
<p>After Qin Wuyan carefully collected the box with seven centipedes, the poison God said lightly: &ldquo;these seven centipedes are rare things in the world. There is only one pair left in the world, and they are always accompanied to death. If they are separated, but within a hundred Li, there must be induction. It must be because of this that Xiaoqi is upset these days. &quot;</p>
<p>Qin Wuyan looked at the poison God and said suddenly, &ldquo;so now that man is on Qingyun Mountain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The poison God smiled and said, &ldquo;yes, seven centipedes are the only species in the world. There is no mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he turned his head and looked slowly into the distance. In the distance, the towering Qingyun Mountain outside the city of Heyang is standing in the sky. It&rsquo;s almost invincible. Surrounded by white clouds, it&rsquo;s immortal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A hundred years, in a flash, another hundred years!&rdquo; The old man whispered to himself. (to be continued. )</p>
