      <p>Qingyun Mountain, Dazhu peak.</p>
<p>It has been many days since the end of the battle of Qingyun. The battlefield, which once changed its color, has gradually become quiet. All traces of the war have been quietly erased in the process of people cleaning up.</p>
<p>On that day, I don&rsquo;t know how many people lost their friends and relatives. On Tongtian peak, I don&rsquo;t know how many corpses were piled up. From the top of the mountain to the foot of the mountain, it was like the legendary underworld prison.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s because of luck! The number of people is the most thin line of Dazhu peak. In this war, no disciple died. However, almost everyone hung up the lottery. It was not easy to stay in the field of Dazhu peak because it was not easy to open the seal of heaven, and he was very tired. Among all the disciples, Wu Dayi, the second disciple, and he Dazhi, the fourth disciple, were the most seriously injured. After these days, they were still in bed and recuperated. Unfortunately, they did not hurt their muscles and bones. It is not easy to see them in person after passing through Tian, and they just need to recuperate quietly. Over time, they will not be hindered in their practice.</p>
<p>However, it was just in a decisive battle between life and death that he narrowly defeated the beast God and saved the whole world. The whole line of Dazhu peak was very depressing. All the disciples have not been happy for a few days, even Tian is not easy, even the brow is tight.</p>
<p>In the early morning of this day, Tian Buyi was sent by the headmaster daoxuan to call his disciples to tongtianfeng for discussion. When he came back at noon, he was a chubby face, gloomy, and his brows were twisted together, and he could hardly open it again.</p>
<p>Around noon, Tian Buyi ordered all the disciples of dazhufeng to come to the Shoujing hall. They were Wu Dayi and he Dazhi, who were still in bed. Tian Buyi also asked people to help them to the Shoujing hall and sit on one side.</p>
<p>In Shoujing hall, which has always been relatively cold, few people have come. Tian Buyi&rsquo;s wife, Su Ru, also stands beside the head of the hall. She is still beautiful, but she still wears a white bandage on her left hand. Naturally, she was also decorated in that war.</p>
<p>Tian Buyi walked back and forth several times in Shoujing hall, and looked at the disciples sitting or standing in a row. In a low voice, he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m calling you here today, not for anything else, but for the ancient sword of killing immortals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The faces of the disciples were dignified, but not many of them showed a look of astonishment. Obviously, most people have already guessed.</p>
<p>Tian Buyi looked at Su Ru beside him, and then looked at the disciples. He said, &ldquo;this morning, the real master asked me to go there again. Only martial uncle Shuiyue of xiaozhufeng came with me. As for what to say, you can probably think of it. In any case, you should keep it a secret and never let out any information about the destruction of Zhuxian ancient sword. &quot;</p>
<p>The disciples of dazhufeng looked at each other. Finally, song Daren, the eldest disciple, coughed and said, &ldquo;master, you know us a lot. We would rather die than say a word about such a matter of great importance.&rdquo; At this point, he hesitated. Looking at Tian Bu Yi, he lowered his voice and said, &ldquo;master, not to mention that you and Shiniang have repeatedly reminded us that it&rsquo;s the fourth time that we&rsquo;ve heard this from the master master master and the Tongtian peak. Is it possible that Is it that they do not believe us, even the master and the teacher&rsquo;s wife? &quot;</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi frowned and suddenly exclaimed, &ldquo;be bold! What kind of thing are you? Do you dare to guess at the real person and the teachers? &quot;</p>
<p>Song Daren&rsquo;s face changed. He bowed his head and said, &ldquo;yes, I know I was wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru stood aside, sighed, and came to the arena and said, &ldquo;OK. Well, these are the words that the real master ordered. Moreover, the damage of Zhuxian ancient sword has a lot to do with it. It&rsquo;s no wonder that the headmaster&rsquo;s elder martial brother is very nervous about this, so he asked several times. It&rsquo;s also right to explain it more often. &quot;</p>
<p>Tian was not easy to twist his head to one side. Without speaking, song Daren and other disciples bowed their heads and said, &ldquo;I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru looked at the disciples one by one and said softly, &ldquo;I know that you have some grievances in your heart. You feel that the real master and the teachers can&rsquo;t believe you. In fact, in the final analysis, these are all because of the great importance. After the previous wars, our Qingyun gate had no reputation in the world&rsquo;s right way for a while, and it suppressed all other members of the same sect. But all this, to put it bluntly, is because the real leader in Tongtian peak, holding the sword of killing immortals, fought with the God of beasts and defeated him. We have everything today in Qingyun gate. I think you know as well as I do about the weight of this immortal sword.</p>
<p>&quot;</p>
<p>Su Ru said with a sad smile, &ldquo;but I never thought that this magic sword would&hellip;&rdquo; After a pause, she seemed to have calmed down before she could continue to speak. She said: &ldquo;in addition to the leader real person and several senior masters who came later, only the disciples of dazhufeng and several female disciples of xiaozhufeng witnessed the destruction of the magic sword. Therefore, for the sake of the reputation of our sect and the reputation in the world, the real leader should pay more attention to it and give more instructions. Don&rsquo;t take it to heart. Just remember to keep it in your heart forever. Do you know? &quot;</p>
<p>Song Daren and others looked at each other and said in unison, &ldquo;I know, I will obey the orders of Shifu and Shiniang.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru turned her head and looked at Tian Buyi, who frowned and looked heavy on her fat face. She did not seem to be relieved by Su Ru&rsquo;s words. She just held out her hand and waved it to all the disciples and said, &ldquo;you should remember what your teacher mother said. All right, go down! &quot;</p>
<p>Song Daren and others made a ceremony together, then turned around and went down together. Wu Dayi and he Dazhi were also helped by song Daren and Du Bishu. Soon, everyone went out, leaving Tian Buyi and Su Ru standing on the Shoujing hall.</p>
<p>Su Ru looked at Tian Buyi&rsquo;s more and more gloomy face, slowly walked to him and whispered, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter? Is the leader&rsquo;s elder martial brother angry again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi snorted lightly and said, &ldquo;he is not only angry with me, but also a person like Shuiyue. He even scolds me like that. What am I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru was surprised and said, &ldquo;what, the headmaster, he even scolded sister Shuiyue?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian is not easy to appear on the face of a fretful color, pace back and forth obviously fast up, frown is also more tight.</p>
<p>Su Ru was worried about him, but she didn&rsquo;t know what to say. She only said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t worry too much. The headmaster and senior brother are just too anxious for a while, so that&rsquo;s why&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi suddenly raised his head and interrupted in a loud voice: &ldquo;if he is really too anxious, he will scold me a thousand times and ten thousand times. I don&rsquo;t care anymore? &quot;</p>
<p>Su Ru lowered her head, but quickly raised her head. She looked surprised and asked, &ldquo;what did you say just now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The field is not easy to mumble. Walking back and forth in the Shoujing hall, his face became more and more restless and worried.</p>
<p>Su Ru was even more worried and said in a hurry, &ldquo;what do you mean? Tell me quickly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian is not easy to go to Su Ru. After a pause and a moment&rsquo;s silence, he said in a deep voice: &ldquo;since these days, elder martial brother daoxuan has repeatedly asked Shuiyue and me to go, and repeatedly told his disciples to keep secrets. This is not to blame. But in recent years, I think elder martial brother daoxuan has become more and more wrong. &quot;</p>
<p>Su Ru was stunned for a moment and said, &ldquo;something&rsquo;s wrong. What does that mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi frowned and said, &ldquo;in the past, did you remember that elder martial brother daoxuan easily scolded others?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru was silent. For a long time, he shook his head and said, &ldquo;the leader&rsquo;s elder martial brother has a profound and profound moral conduct, and his joy and anger are not reflected in his color. He can&rsquo;t easily get angry and scold people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi nodded: &ldquo;yes, that&rsquo;s right. Even you know that. However, after the war, elder martial brother daoxuan seems to have changed his temperament and become more and more impatient. He has called me to Shuiyue for several times, and even if he told me to do so. However, at the beginning of each time, she was always pleasant, but in the end, I didn&rsquo;t know why, because a little bit of inexplicable little things got angry or insulted. Or anger, in short&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>He shook his head, slowly raised his eyes to Su Ru, hesitated for a moment, approached Su Ru, lowered his voice and said, &ldquo;I doubt it. Elder martial brother daoxuan has been attacked by the spirit of the immortal sword during the war with the beast God, so he just</p>
<p>Su Ru&rsquo;s face changed and she said, &ldquo;stop it.&rdquo; Then he walked quickly to the outside of Shoujing hall, looked left and right, and after confirming that there was no one, he came back to Tian and said in a low voice: &ldquo;this is the secret affair of Qingyun gate. You and you can&rsquo;t talk nonsense!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi sighed and said, &ldquo;how important this matter is, how dare I speak nonsense. However, in the previous wars, elder martial brother daoxuan, in order to win, despite my repeated dissuasions, forced his ancestors to seal the seal of green clouds and seven meridians, which greatly increased the power of the ancient sword of killing immortals. However, I often think about the fate left by the ancestors of the previous generation, and prepare to say that this ancient sword for killing immortals is too fierce and murderous against the sky. It seems that it is an ominous thing, so I can&rsquo;t take it as easy. When I came back today, I was separated from Shuiyue at Tongtian peak. Although I had never been at peace with each other, I felt as if I felt something in my heart when I saw each other. I think the water moon must have the same idea in my heart. It&rsquo;s just that this matter is so important that neither of us dare to say it out. &quot;</p>
<p>Su Ru was silent for a long time, and said in a slightly astringent voice: &ldquo;even so, in the final analysis, it is still on the ancient sword of killing immortals.</p>
<p>Now that the killing of immortals has been destroyed, even if the headmaster and elder martial brother are unfortunately injured, there is no source. On the other hand, he can communicate with the gods through Taoism. As long as time goes on, most of them will gradually wake up and resolve by themselves. &quot;</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi&rsquo;s heavy color didn&rsquo;t fade. He said faintly, &ldquo;I hope so. Otherwise, with him as the respect of Qingyun, in case there is a good or bad thing, the Qingyun gate will go up and down I don&rsquo;t know how to end it. &quot;</p>
<p>Su Ru thought about it, then sighed helplessly and said, &ldquo;well, it&rsquo;s not something we can manage now. You don&rsquo;t have to worry too much. One more thing, I&rsquo;ve always wanted to ask: how to deal with the damaged Zhuxian ancient sword? &quot;</p>
<p>Tian Buyi pondered for a moment and said: &ldquo;I had inquired about this matter with a senior brother who knew that. After hearing that elder martial brother daoxuan had scolded everyone on the spot that they should not let out, he immediately picked up the Zhuxian sword which had been broken in two and walked into the magic moon cave, and no one was allowed to enter the forbidden area of the magic moon cave. So up to now, no one knows what happened to the ancient sword of killing immortals? Perhaps, there is hope to repair it? &quot;</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi said the last word to himself, but then shook his head and wryly laughed. Obviously, he didn&rsquo;t believe in such a thing. With a bitter smile, he said casually, &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t care about the sword, but we went to tongtianfeng today. In addition to the inexplicable abuse, we also heard a strange thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru was stunned and said, &ldquo;what strange thing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi shrugged his shoulders and said, &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t believe that many of the disciples and elders who died in the previous wars are now in the Yuqing Hall of Tongtian peak. But our elder martial brother daoxuan doesn&rsquo;t show his face every day in the Yuqing hall. Instead, he goes to the ancestral hall of Houshan to be a guardian. Is that strange? &quot;</p>
<p>Su Ru was stunned and said, &ldquo;Shou Ling, what&rsquo;s wrong with the ancestral hall? Is it possible that the elder passed away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi shakes his head. He sneered: &ldquo;where is the elder? I heard some elder disciples secretly discuss it. In fact, he is an old man who has been guarding and cleaning the ancestral hall for decades. Somehow, he died on that day. How did you die. No one knows. Only that elder martial brother daoxuan was numb for a moment, but then he was furious. I heard that he had been out of his wits for several days.</p>
<p>In the end, he insisted on putting the old man&rsquo;s spiritual tablet in the ancestral hall, but the strangest thing was that the tablet he put in the ancestral hall was blank! &quot;</p>
<p>Su Ru was more and more confused when she heard this. She shook her head and said, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s wrong with this, this, and this? Is it true that the leader is confused?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian is not easy to sneer and says, &ldquo;is he confused? No one knows. Anyway, someone tried to persuade him, but he refused to listen. Besides, he didn&rsquo;t go to have a good look at the spirit tablets of those disciples in Yuqing hall. Instead, he ran to the ancestral hall and looked at the blank spirit tablet in a daze. If you go on like this, I think the Qingyun gate will be destroyed sooner or later. &quot;</p>
<p>Su Ru was speechless. After a long time, she sighed and looked out of the Shoujing hall. In the lonely afternoon, the outside was also empty, except for the blue sky in the distance.</p>
<p>The mountain wind blows. The sound of bamboo waves in the back mountain is faintly heard, but somehow, it adds a bit of loneliness.</p>
<p>Qingyun Mountain, Tongtian peak. The ancestral hall of Houshan.</p>
<p>It is as quiet and solemn as ever. The tall ancestral hall is still standing, and the surrounding woods are as green as ever. It seems that the earth shaking war happened on Qingyun Mountain a few days ago has no impact on this place.</p>
<p>In addition to the absence of an old man to clean, there is also the dark god table. There is a strange and blank Lingpai in a small place among the countless tablets.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu knelt in silence before the empty throne, dressed in sackcloth and dressed in filial piety. In front of him was a brazier. On the table were two white candles, three incense sticks, and light smoke, which floated gently. Soon, they were integrated into other incense offerings and could not be separated.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu&rsquo;s face was sad, his lips were tightly pursed, and he knelt on the ground. He slowly put a pile of paper money into the burning tongue in the fire pot in front of him. He watched them curl and turn yellow and turn to ashes, and then slowly put in new paper money.</p>
<p>In the meantime, from time to time, he looked up at the blank spirit tablet. The Taoist priest, the leader of Qingyun gate, insisted on putting the old man&rsquo;s spiritual position in the ancestral hall alone. Other elders did not agree with him. However, the leader of Qingyun sect always had weight. After the immortal daoxuan defeated the beast God at one stroke, his reputation was even more outstanding. When people saw that he insisted on not retreating, they had to follow him.</p>
<p>Although Lin Jingyu didn&rsquo;t expect this, what happened next surprised him even more. Immortal daoxuan actually put a blank spiritual niche into the ancestral hall. For this reason, Lin Jingyu even bravely asked immortal daoxuan who came to worship him.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the Taoist immortal just asked a question lightly, and then refuted Lin Jingyu with silence: &ldquo;do you know his name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu was stunned. Although he had followed the mysterious old man for ten years, he never told him anything about the old man&rsquo;s own past. At the moment, there was nothing he could do to let Lin Jingyu say anything. Just looking at the appearance of the real man daoxuan, he obviously knew something about the old man, but he didn&rsquo;t mean to reveal it.</p>
<p>Although Lin Jingyu was puzzled, he didn&rsquo;t dare to be too presumptuous with the real person in charge, so he had to retreat quietly. Anyway, in his mind, although the tablet of the old man was empty, his voice and face were clearly engraved in his heart, and never faded away.</p>
<p>He had also visited Qianshan public sacrifice, but he always felt that there were countless disciples worshipping there. However, although the master had a peerless knowledge, he passed away so quietly. He had to die for him anyway, and immortal daoxuan seemed to acquiesce in his coming here to clean up the affairs of the old man. In addition, he often came to the ancestral hall to visit the empty spirit tablet of the old man with the respect of the headmaster and the astonished eyes of many disciples. This caused a lot of speculation, but Lin Jingyu could not control it.</p>
<p>At the moment, he suddenly heard a sound of footsteps behind him. For a few days, Lin Jingyu had already heard this step well. He knew that it was the Taoist immortal.</p>
<p>He stood up and looked back and whispered, &ldquo;master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Daoxuan immortal slowly walked into the ancestral hall.</p>
<p>The light in the ancestral hall is dim. Although Lin Jingyu has been staying here, he can&rsquo;t see daoxuan&rsquo;s face for a moment. He only dimly sees daoxuan&rsquo;s figure. Standing in the shadow, he looks at the blank spirit tablet beside him.</p>
<p>Somehow, Lin Jingyu looked at the dim shadow in the dark, and suddenly felt something was wrong. However, he could not tell what was wrong. He just felt a heartbeat for no reason and felt nervous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he OK?&rdquo; At last, daoxuan real man began to speak. His voice was rather low and hoarse. He seemed to exert his strength and suppress something, which was quite different from his previous tone.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu was even more puzzled, but he still replied, &ldquo;the disciple has been keeping vigil for the elder day and night, burning incense on time, and has never been neglected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The figure in the shadow moved for a moment and said slowly: &ldquo;he has been teaching you for ten years with all your heart. Hey, hey&hellip; &quot; He laughs coldly. In this dark ancestral hall, he has a kind of gloomy meaning: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if I die, then&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He suddenly stopped, as if he had said something wrong. Naturally, Lin Jingyu did not dare to talk much and stood there with his hands down.</p>
<p>There was silence in the ancestral hall. After a moment, daoxuan was really humane: &ldquo;you go out first. I have something to say to him alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu was stunned and said, &ldquo;yes.&rdquo; With that, he stepped out.</p>
<p>As soon as he stepped out of the ancestral hall and stood on the sunny open space, Lin Jingyu felt a sense of spirit. Only then did he realize that he felt oppressed in that ancestral hall just now.</p>
<p>He walked around the open space around the ancestral hall and waited for half an hour, but there was still no real daoxuan coming out. It was strange that he turned around and saw a figure of his back disappearing on the path leading to the magic moon cave in front of him. Since the end of the war, the magic moon cave has once again become a forbidden area. Only immortal daoxuan can enter.</p>
