      <p>He put the dishes that had just come out of the pot and were still steaming on the table. Boss he returned to the back of the counter, opened the account book again and pretended to account, but his eyes turned slightly, and he looked at the customers in the shop from time to time.</p>
<p>Zhou Yixian, Xiaohuan and the wild dog Taoist priest are all sitting on the table of the three eyed grey monkey Xiaohui. As for the new dishes, they are also delivered to this table, but they have no appetite. However, Xiao Hui is quite happy. He drinks and eats vegetables. He is very happy.</p>
<p>Zhou Yixian and other three people&rsquo;s eyes are not looking at Xiaohui at the moment, but silently looking at the man on the side of the table.</p>
<p>Xiaohuan was silent for a long time. He slowly reached out his hand and pushed the man. He called in a low voice: &ldquo;ghost Li. &quot;</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s body was pushed by her, but there was no response. Next to Monday fairy and wild dog look at each other.</p>
<p>Naturally, the figure of the man was the ferocity they had seen in the past. However, this character, which had once made countless people afraid, had become so down-to-earth that they could not react at once.</p>
<p>Small ring turns head, astonished way: &ldquo;how did he change to do this appearance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask the two of us,&rdquo; he said He stopped for a moment, then frowned, turned his head to the little ash still sitting on the table, and said with a smile, &ldquo;little monkey, what&rsquo;s the matter with your master?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Hui&rsquo;s three eyes turned together and took a look at the old man. There was no other reaction except a tail standing up behind him. After a while, he spat from his mouth. He turned his head and drank a mouthful of wine. He did not put the old man who looked like a fairy in his eyes.</p>
<p>On Monday, the immortal lost his face. He said angrily, &ldquo;dead monkey, how dare you show me your face?&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s against you. If you annoy your immortal, I will use the immortal method to take you under the Qingyun Mountain and seal the town for 1800 years. I&rsquo;ll see if you are afraid of it&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>The voice did not fall. Monday fairy only heard a whistling, in front of a black, as if something rushed to his face, can&rsquo;t dodge, beside the small ring also exclaimed. Fortunately, a hand was extended from the side, and the old man was pushed to the ground quickly and incomparably.</p>
<p>On Monday, the immortal was caught off guard and only fell on all fours. At the same time, he fell like an immortal in a mess. However, he finally avoided the thing thrown in his face. At this time, the thing hit an empty, fly out of a distance, &ldquo;Du&rdquo; a dull sound, hit the shop wall fell down. It&rsquo;s the bone of a roast chicken.</p>
<p>The crowd, including boss he, who was standing in the distance to watch the excitement, turned around and saw a chicken leg in the hands of a three eyed monkey. They were very happy to eat it. They only did not know whether the bone was thrown out by its hands or by its mouth?</p>
<p>Monday immortal only hated his teeth itching, but his experience was not trivial. He knew that the monkey was an immortal creature. Moreover, it seemed that the monkey had a bad temper. It was better not to provoke him. Besides, there was a master who was famous for his bloodthirsty. If that guy wakes up, it&rsquo;s more trouble.</p>
<p>At the moment, he got up and turned his strange eyes, but he said angrily to the wild dog Taoist: &ldquo;you want me to die, don&rsquo;t you. Why push your fairy so hard? &quot;</p>
<p>Wild dog is dumb, if according to his former temper, naturally already scolded to go back, but now the dog&rsquo;s eyes turn around, actually turn his head away, ignore Monday fairy.</p>
<p>On Monday, Xian was shut down. Is more angry, about to say something, small ring has been beside the angry: &ldquo;grandfather!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In recent years, Monday fairy is the most afraid of this sharp toothed granddaughter. Now she stops, but she murmurs something in her mouth. Obviously, she is unwilling.</p>
<p>Xiao Huan ignored him, turned his head and looked at Xiao Hui, smiling and said, &ldquo;Xiao Hui, do you remember me? I gave you ice sugar gourd to eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Hui looks at Xiao Huan with his three eyes blinking and blinking. He nods and grins. He even swings his tail twice. I don&rsquo;t know if he learned from the yellow dog &ldquo;rhubarb&rdquo; in Dazhu peak of Qingyun Mountain many years ago.</p>
<p>Small ring puff Chi a smile, way: &ldquo;did not expect you still remember me, come here.&rdquo; Then he reached out and waved to the monkey.</p>
<p>Small gray eyes turned around, stretched out his hand to his head. It seemed that he was a little confused. He habitually wanted to grab his head. Unexpectedly, in one hand, he held the wine pot in one hand and the chicken leg in the other hand, which were not empty. He simply rubbed the chicken leg directly on the hairy head for several times, leaving a few oil stains.</p>
<p>Xiaohuan covered his mouth and chuckled. Xiao Hui looked at her smile and grinned. Then she slowly moved over to the table in front of Xiaohuan and squatted down.</p>
<p>Zhou Yixian, wild dog and boss he in the distance all looked straight.</p>
<p>Small ring looked at the monkey carefully, took out a silk scarf from his arms, frowned and said, &ldquo;the thing on the handle is lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three eyed monkey was stunned for a moment, &ldquo;squeak&rdquo; called twice, obviously not very willing. Xiaohuan patted its head and said, &ldquo;quick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohui skimmed his mouth, put the chicken leg back on the plate, and looked at it more. Just as he was about to put down the wine pot, he suddenly took a big drink to his mouth and put it back on the table.</p>
<p>Small ring shakes his head and laughs: &ldquo;how to become so greedy.&rdquo; Then he stretched out his hand and pulled the two monkey hands to the front of his body. He wiped the oil stains on the monkey&rsquo;s hands with a silk towel. Xiaohui was so motionless that he was at the mercy of the small ring.</p>
<p>Strange to say, in addition to its owner&rsquo;s ferocity, the three eyed monkey seems to have some affection for a few other women. As for those like Zhou Yixian and wild dogs, it seems that it has never been satisfied with it.</p>
<p>After wiping, Xiaohuan put the scarves aside, looked at the ghost who was in the air of wine, and said to Xiao Hui, &ldquo;how did he become like this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Hui reached out to grab his head, and began to scream and wave his arms. However, many people were staring at him. It was obvious that no one understood. Xiao Hui seemed to realize this and stopped.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, the monkey reached out to Xiaohuan and nearly stabbed him in his face. Xiaohuan was startled. The wild dog Taoist was about to move. He thought the monkey&rsquo;s wild nature was hard to train, but he was pulled by the man by his side.</p>
<p>Wild dog a Zheng, to Monday immortal look, Monday fairy low voice way: &ldquo;have a look again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>See small ash now pointed to small ring, and then the body suddenly turned a somersault on the table. Jump to the middle of the table, squeak in the mouth, and make a curve to the small ring with both hands from top to bottom.</p>
<p>Xiaohuan was shocked. Next to Monday fairy frowned and said, &ldquo;woman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohui nodded again and again, then pointed to the fallen ghost, and then held his heart in his hands, and called &ldquo;creaky ah&rdquo; in his mouth. Suddenly he fell back, and the whole monkey fell back.</p>
<p>Small ring suddenly called out: &ldquo;be careful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The voice did not fall, I saw Xiao Hui&rsquo;s performance too much. I forgot that this was just a small table. I had already reached the edge of the table just now. As soon as I fell down, I only heard the sound of &ldquo;plop&rdquo; and immediately fell under the table.</p>
<p>Xiaohuan is funny and worried, so she wants to get up to check, but &ldquo;instigate&rdquo;. The monkey had already come up from the ground again, hands on the ground, grinning at the little ring.</p>
<p>Small ring to see three eyes, the monkey seems to have no injury, this just rest assured, reached out to touch its head, small gray eyes blink and blink, looking at small ring.</p>
<p>Xiaohuan pondered for a moment, then looked at the ghostly figure, turned his head and said to the immortal on Monday: &ldquo;grandfather, this is&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhou Yixian frowned and said, &ldquo;is it that he was hurt by a woman? With his current Taoism and the power of ghost King sect. In the world, few women can do it. Is it the water moon of Qingyun gate, or is it the three wonders of the Huan sect of the demon sect? &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s like that,&rdquo; said the Taoist</p>
<p>On Monday, the immortal said angrily, &ldquo;what do you say? You dare to say that I am. Well, Ben is not right</p>
<p>The wild dog Taoist didn&rsquo;t look at him. A strange expression appeared on a dog&rsquo;s face. Looking at the fallen figure, he said slowly: &ldquo;as far as I know, he is not a man who takes victory and defeat seriously. Besides, he didn&rsquo;t have any injuries&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>Monday immortal snorted, but he was not satisfied with it. He said sarcastically, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s because you are too far away from others. If you are a Taoist who only has a few skills and is defeated one after another, naturally, he looks down on the victory and defeat very lightly. He says every day,&rdquo; victory and defeat are common affairs of military families&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>The wild dog Taoist was very angry and was about to refute. Xiao Huan glared at the two of them and raised his voice and said, &ldquo;OK, don&rsquo;t say it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Monday, the fairy and the wild dog stopped at the same time, but they still looked at each other angrily.</p>
<p>Small ring thought, and then nodded, as if made a decision, and then squatted in front of the monkey: &ldquo;small ash, you go with us first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Hui didn&rsquo;t respond, but Zhouxian and the wild dog Taoist priest cried out first. The voice was so loud that even the boss he in the distance was scared.</p>
<p>Xiaohuan looked at them and said, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wild dog Taoist priest stammered for a moment and said, &ldquo;he and his enemies are too many. I&rsquo;m afraid there will be trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Small ring way: &ldquo;I am not afraid, what are you afraid of?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wild dog Taoist was silent, but Zhou Yixian, who was next to him, gave up. He said angrily to Xiaohuan, &ldquo;we are not a charity. Why do you take in others all day long?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Huan glared at his grandfather and said, &ldquo;he is not someone else. He saved my life in the dead pool! Besides, &ldquo;she suddenly gave a deep smile and said,&rdquo; grandfather, do you remember that you cheated others about stepping on the shit luck more than ten years ago? &quot;</p>
<p>The wild dog dawned, but on Monday it was a red face, and the angry way said, &ldquo;what did you do over the past ten years?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Small ring hums a, light way: &ldquo;you remember good, anyway I can&rsquo;t look at regardless.&rdquo; After that, he ignored his grandfather and turned his head to look after GUI Li.</p>
<p>When the man&rsquo;s body was gently turned over, a gust of wine gas came to his face, and Xiaohuan frowned. However, he saw his familiar face with his eyes closed and his eyebrows wrinkled together. I don&rsquo;t know if he was sad even when he was drunk.</p>
<p>Xiaohuan looked at the man&rsquo;s face in silence, and her heart suddenly passed that day. Outside the dead pool, the man went to her fortune telling booth and said in a low voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You grow up&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Naturally, Zhouxian didn&rsquo;t know that his granddaughter had some wild thoughts at the moment, but he was very clear that he was only afraid that he would have a big trouble. Under such circumstances, he would not be in a good mood. He turned his head and glared: &ldquo;boss, settle the accounts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Boss he quickly ran over and said with a smile, &ldquo;my guest, don&rsquo;t you sit more?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhou Yixian said angrily, &ldquo;more seats? After sitting for a while, I got into a lot of trouble. I&rsquo;m bored to death when I sit more than once</p>
<p>Boss he held back his smile and said, &ldquo;thank you, sir. Four silver coins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Monday fairy mumbled. Just took out the silver from my arms, and suddenly the little ash came over, but took the big wine bag on his back and waved it to boss he. The mouth is full of squeaks.</p>
<p>Zhou Yixian and Xiaohuan are all in a daze. They don&rsquo;t know what the monkey is up to. However, boss he has been with the monkey for three days. He knows a little bit. At the moment, he frowns and ponders. Suddenly he said, &ldquo;are you going to add wine to this wine bag?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Hui was overjoyed, nodded desperately and grinned.</p>
<p>Zhou Yixian and others were astonished. After a long time, Xiao Huan coughed and said with a dry smile: &ldquo;shopkeeper, you can help it add Add some wine. &quot;</p>
<p>Boss he was so happy that he answered and went back to take the wine.</p>
<p>Speaking of this big wine bag is really huge, with the wine into. The wine bag was gradually bulging up, but the boss he poured two jars of wine into it, and it was still not full. Xiao Hui was smiling at the side of the bottle. However, Monday immortal could not bear to bear it any more. He jumped up and said angrily, &ldquo;enough, enough&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hoo!&rdquo; A dark shadow flew to his face, and Monday immortal had experience at this time. Hearing the voice, he quickly dodged. As expected, Xiaohui directly lost a dish. &ldquo;Bang&rdquo; hit the ground and split.</p>
<p>Zhou Yixian has yet to say, &ldquo;huhuhuhu&rdquo; the plates on the table are thrown by small ashes one after another. He dodges from left to right, and he doesn&rsquo;t care what to say. However, the boss he saw the sound of plates breaking, which made him heartbroken. When he looked at the wine bag, there was not much left. He even said, &ldquo;forget it. I&rsquo;ll give you the rest of the wine. Don&rsquo;t throw away your plate, monkey. This, er, immortal, you can count the money for two jars of wine. &quot;</p>
<p>Xiao Hui just stopped. Monday fairy stopped, gasping and swearing, but he didn&rsquo;t dare to get close to the angry three eyed monkey.</p>
<p>Xiao Huan smiles. She turns her eyes from there and returns to Gui Li. However, she doesn&rsquo;t notice the wild dog Taoist who hasn&rsquo;t made a sound for a long time. At the same time, she stares at GUI Li from the side, and her eyes gradually twinkle with strange light.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Qingyun Mountain, Tongtian peak.</p>
<p>Under the stone steps in front of the main hall of Yuqing hall, in the cold pool of clear water, Qilin, the spirit beast of Qingyun gate, turned over comfortably in the water. The water waves rolled and was rolled around by its huge body, setting off layers of waves.</p>
<p>Li Xun, a special disciple of the burning incense Valley, looked at the blue water cold pool for a while on the stone steps, then turned his head and said with a smile: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard that the water Qilin, the spirit beast in Qingyun gate town, is a thousand year old spirit beast. Now I see it, it&rsquo;s really extraordinary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elder martial brother Li flattered me.&rdquo; A clear laugh came from Li Xun&rsquo;s side. Xiao Yicai, the most famous disciple of Qingyun gate and Tianfeng gate, also looked at Shui Qilin and said with a smile, &ldquo;lingzun is still the spirit beast that we sent our ancestor Qingye to accept at that time. If we think of the founder&rsquo;s style, we will admire him very much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li Xun nods and smiles. He comes from a well-known family, and his eyes are higher than the top. However, he also admires the amazing founder of Qingye.</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai stretched out his hand and said to the top of the mountain: &ldquo;brother Li, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li xunqian asked for a moment to walk with Xiao Yicai at the same time.</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai walked and said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s important for elder martial brother Li&rsquo;s visit this time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li Xun said with a smile: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s nothing. It&rsquo;s just that the master has a letter and wants me to present it to immortal daoxuan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai was stunned and moved and said, &ldquo;why, is the master of your valley, Mr. Yun, already out of the pass? I heard Lu Xueqi, younger martial sister Lu Xueqi, who just came back from southern Xinjiang a while ago. Master Yun is still in seclusion</p>
<p>With a smile, Li Xun said, &ldquo;to be honest, elder martial brother Xiao, my master just left the Customs a few days ago. After listening to his old man&rsquo;s words, he has not seen his old friends such as Zhongtu daoxuan immortal and master Puhong for many years. He is very concerned and has the heart to come to visit him! &quot;</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai&rsquo;s face changed slightly, and then he said with a laugh: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s better than that. The presence of master Yun&rsquo;s Xianjia is really something that hasn&rsquo;t happened to me for a long time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li Xun turns his eyes, and Xiao Yicai looks at him. After a long time of attention, they suddenly burst out laughing at the same time. They are very happy.</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai took Li Xun&rsquo;s hand and said with a smile, &ldquo;take a walk. My master is just chatting with all martial uncles in Yuqing hall today. Let me lead the way and introduce elder martial brother Li.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li Xun said with a smile, &ldquo;thank you so much, elder martial brother Xiao.&rdquo; After saying a few steps, he seemed to suddenly think of something. He said to Xiao Yicai: &ldquo;by the way, elder martial brother Xiao, there is one thing I would like to ask you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai said with a smile, &ldquo;elder martial brother Li, it&rsquo;s OK to say so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li Xun said: &ldquo;before, Qingyun gate sent Lu Xueqi to visit the master in southern Xinjiang&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai&rsquo;s face changed slightly, and then returned to normal. However, the expression still fell in Li Xun&rsquo;s eyes. Li Xun moved in his heart, but he continued: &ldquo;when we parted that day, it seemed that she was slightly injured. In other words, she was also responsible for helping me burn incense Valley. I was very upset in my heart. I didn&rsquo;t know how well she was recently?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai thought for a moment and said, &ldquo;thank you very much for your concern. Sister Lu is in good health. It&rsquo;s just that uncle Shuiyue has come with her disciples Wenmin and Lu Xueqi. You can see her later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li Xun couldn&rsquo;t help but feel a little joy on his face and nodded his head.</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai looked at his expression and did not speak. They went up, but the topic of the road also changed. They talked about some unimportant things. After a long time, they had already reached the stone steps and came to the jade Hall of Tongtian peak.</p>
<p>A large and magnificent building appeared in front of Li Xun.</p>
<p>Li Xun looked at it for a long time and sighed: &ldquo;I thought that the Zhongshan River hall and xuanhuotan in the incense valley were the world&rsquo;s best songs. When I saw it today, I knew that there were people outside, and there was a heaven out there!&rdquo;</p>
