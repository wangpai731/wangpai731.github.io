      <p>The man in black standing at the door was a mysterious figure of the guiwangzong. The wild dog Taoist lived in the guiwangzong for a period of time after being taken over by the ghost. He had seen him several times. Although he still knew little about what Mr. ghost looked like, he understood that he was a very important person and was not a person he could compare with.</p>
<p>How can we not be surprised to see this man in such a place. Zhouxian and Xiaohuan didn&rsquo;t know the identity of the mysterious man in black, but there was a faint look of fear on the face of Taoist wild dog. They knew that the man was only afraid that he was not a good man, so he could not help being nervous.</p>
<p>But Mr. ghost drifted in, but he didn&rsquo;t seem to expect that there were people in this quiet and gloomy place, and some of them could recognize themselves, and their body was shocked. A moment later, he saw the three people in the room, especially the Taoist priest of wild dog, and immediately calmed down. He looked at the wild dog Taoist priest, then looked at Zhouxian and Xiaohuan. Finally, he returned to the wild dog with a calm voice and said, &ldquo;are you a wild dog Taoist?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is the first time for Taoist priest yegou to see Mr. ghost several times in the past. He followed GUI Li in the Guiwang clan and saw the mysterious black figure from a distance. It is the first time that he saw Mr. ghost face-to-face and close. Unexpectedly, after listening to the ghost, he recognized himself. He could not help but feel shocked and said, &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost said, &ldquo;you have always followed Mr. GUI Li. How come you suddenly come to such a place? And what are these two people?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taoist wild dog asked him why I couldn&rsquo;t come because you came, but he still didn&rsquo;t dare to say anything. He had to say in a low voice: &ldquo;I, I and GUI Li are separated. I will go to him soon. They are both my friends. &quot;</p>
<p>The meaning of Mr. GUI is plain. It seems that he doesn&rsquo;t care at all. The Taoist priest intentionally or unintentionally accentuates the word &ldquo;Gui Li&rdquo; and says, &ldquo;Oh, I know, but you still don&rsquo;t say. How could you come here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wild dog Taoist was speechless for a moment. I don&rsquo;t know how to say it&rsquo;s OK. But Monday immortal looked at the ghost man for a long time. Then he said, &ldquo;I have a relative&rsquo;s spiritual throne here. We are here to worship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost&rsquo;s eyes were fixed. Then he saw three people behind them. On the sacrificial table, there was a worn-out Spirit card with several words written on it: the spiritual throne of Zhou Xingyun.</p>
<p>Mr. ghost nodded, and then seemed to ponder for a moment. The eyes behind the black veil flickered. He said slowly, &ldquo;since you have already worshipped here, it&rsquo;s a ghost place, so it&rsquo;s not suitable to stay here for a long time. You&rsquo;d better leave quickly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wild dog Taoist turned his head and looked at Zhouxian and Xiaohuan. His original intention was that he would not stay with such a ghostly figure. What&rsquo;s more, Mr. GUI&rsquo;s words seemed to be that if he didn&rsquo;t look at the fierce points, he would not know whether he would leave three people. However, the wild dog Taoist is not sure whether Monday immortal will understand that this person is a person that can not be provoked, and just looked at it. Zhou Yixian had a deep affection for his early son. At the moment, he was suddenly ordered to leave. I really don&rsquo;t know if he would scold him with his usual temperament.</p>
<p>Sure enough, when the wild dog Taoist looked back, a heart suddenly sank down. There was nothing left in Zhouxian&rsquo;s face. He seemed to be thinking of something tightly. His eyes were also a little strange and uncertain. However, little ring&rsquo;s beautiful face was a little more angry. Obviously, she was very angry with the words of the man in black. She was going to turn her back on her mouth.</p>
<p>The wild dog Taoist was in a great hurry, and a moment later, he saw sweat on his forehead. In the heart secretly called bad, is from the panic place, suddenly saw Monday fairy step forward, walked to the small ring body in front of her, small ring words to the mouth, but was surprised. Changed back: &ldquo;you Why, grandfather, what are you doing? &quot;</p>
<p>Monday immortal looked at the ghost who was still standing at the door like a ghost and said, &ldquo;no, we&rsquo;re here to see your father. Since we&rsquo;ve all paid our respects, we&rsquo;d better go. Anyway, there&rsquo;s nothing to do here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Huan was stunned and couldn&rsquo;t speak for a moment. However, Taoist wild dog let out a breath and let his heart jump to his throat. Then he put it back and walked quickly up the road: &ldquo;yes, yes, let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How clever little ring, at this time how much also understand things are wrong, now also no longer adhere to, nodded. Then the three men packed up their bags. The wild dog Taoist took the lead and went to the door of the house. Mr. ghost quietly made way for a road and drifted into the dark place of the house. It looked like a ghost.</p>
<p>The three quickly walked out of the room. The sun was shining again. After a few steps, they only heard the door behind the room. They heard two frightening &ldquo;whoops&rdquo; and closed them with a bang.</p>
<p>When they walked so far away from the villa that they could hardly see the shadow of the house, the three stopped. Taoist wild dog and Zhou Yixian took a breath at the same time. Xiaohuan looked at them and frowned: &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter with you? Why are you afraid of this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhou Yixian ignored her and looked down for a moment. Then he raised his head and said to the wild dog Taoist, &ldquo;what did you call him, Mr. ghost, and who is this man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wild dog Taoist hesitated for a moment and said, &ldquo;he is the most mysterious person in the ghost King&rsquo;s clan. He seems to be a kind of elder who worships the ghost king. He is always with the ghost king when he appears. I don&rsquo;t know what kind of person he is, but he is certainly not an ordinary person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhou Yixian frowned and was silent. Xiaohuan was a little strange. He seldom saw his grandfather think so carefully. He asked curiously, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter, grandfather? Do you think this person is very strange?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhou Xian nodded slowly, his tone was very slow and cautious, and said, &ldquo;this man is really very important. You can&rsquo;t underestimate him. What&rsquo;s more, when you were in the villa, did you notice something three feet away from the wall in the right corner of the room? &quot;</p>
<p>Xiao Huan and Taoist wild dog were both in a daze when they heard the speech. However, Xiao Huan was more careful and frowned: &ldquo;grandfather, I remember there is nothing else there except a few coffins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Monday, the immortal snorted, &ldquo;yes, it&rsquo;s the coffin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s so strange about the coffin? It&rsquo;s a village. There&rsquo;s a coffin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Monday, the immortal glanced at him and said, &ldquo;what do you know about this rubbish? Naturally, other coffins are not counted, but one of them is quite different. It is not only not as thick as other coffins, but also has a very neat north-south orientation. The location is the place where Yin Qi is most abundant in the ghost land. &quot;</p>
<p>Speaking of this, Monday fairy looks more dignified and says: &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think of this. The coffin was not conspicuous, but just now the wild dog saw the man calling &ldquo;Mr. ghost&rdquo;. My heart moved. I looked at the ghost geomantic omen in the room, and I could see that there was a way out. I&rsquo;m afraid that this person is really a person of the ghost Road, so we should take this Yin Qi to keep quiet.</p>
<p>’At this point, however, Zhou Xian&rsquo;s face was somewhat puzzled. He bowed his head slightly and said to himself in a somewhat puzzled way: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s just that although people in the demon sect often practice weird ways, they seem to be better at witchcraft in southern Xinjiang. How could they appear in this person?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wild dog Taoist suddenly interjected: &ldquo;that&rsquo;s not true. There was an old man named blood sucking demon in Wandu gate at that time, besides the famous blood sucking method. Didn&rsquo;t you also practice the &ldquo;Five ghosts guarding the spirit&rdquo; array? &quot;</p>
<p>On Monday, the immortal said, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t know how to pretend to understand. The blood sucking old trash learned some short weight magic from nowhere. He forced to arrest some innocent souls, and then pretended to frighten people. When you really want to use them, most of them are broken by people. The witchcraft in southern Xinjiang is extensive and profound, and there are more astonishing achievements in the same vein of ghost road. Where can that waste be compared? &quot;</p>
<p>Wild dog Taoist was dumb, but looked back. However, he felt that, just as Zhou Xian said, when the blood sucking old demon ambushed Zhang Xiaofan, who was a disciple of Qingyun, he used the Five ghosts to control the spirit for the first time, which was really broken by Zhang Xiaofan inexplicably. Although the scene was quite strange at that time, and the magic weapon in Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s hands was full of ghost spirit, it was the reason that the blood sucking old demon was not successful in any case. At such a thought, the wild dog Taoist couldn&rsquo;t help but despise the blood sucking old demon, but he forgot how he struggled to beg for mercy under him.</p>
<p>Xiaohuan stood beside her, frowning and saying, &ldquo;grandfather. After all, if there is a spirit father in the middle of the room, why not</p>
<p>Monday immortal slowly shook his head and said, &ldquo;it doesn&rsquo;t matter if your father died for many years, but after all, it&rsquo;s also the place where your father&rsquo;s spirit is located. I can&rsquo;t just ignore my son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, the Taoist priest was startled and said, &ldquo;what are you talking about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Monday immortal snorted and said, &ldquo;naturally, I want to go back and have a look. I can&rsquo;t just walk away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wild dog Taoist turned pale and said angrily, &ldquo;that man is not a person you and I can afford, do you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Monday, the immortal Pooh, ignoring him, said to himself: &ldquo;according to common sense, these ghost people have the most Yin Qi at night, which is also the best time for him to practice meditation. If we inquire, we should also take the day as our best.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that if he bumps into him today, we can&rsquo;t go back so early. We&rsquo;d better wait until evening. &quot;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan nodded and said, &ldquo;OK.&rdquo; Then he seemed to think of something, turned to the wild dog Taoist and said, &ldquo;Taoist priest, you&rsquo;d better not go with us. My grandfather and I are worried because there is a spiritual place for my father, so we have to go back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seeing by Xiao Huan&rsquo;s bright eyes, Taoist wild dog suddenly closed his mouth after opening his mouth to say something. After a while, he said, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan was a little surprised, but she still gave a smile and said, &ldquo;well, ha ha, Taoist priest, you are really a good man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wild dog Taoist is silent, but the next Monday immortal is two sneers with profound meaning.</p>
<p>The three men waited in this quiet lane. There were still a few figures in the distance, but after it was getting late, even those figures gradually disappeared. Presumably, it was also because this was the villa.</p>
<p>When the night finally came, the noisy day of Heyang City, people who were shrouded in the fear of monster catastrophe finally passed another day. The sleepy people quietly fell asleep with fear and confusion about the future in every corner of this city. Who cares about the things around?</p>
<p>There is no moon in the night sky, dark clouds are heavy, Heyang city looks dark, only the distant sky, there are one or two faint starlight, far away, emitting faint light. The night breeze, with a trace of cold and cold, issued a thin whine, quietly blowing from the top of the city.</p>
<p>On Monday, the three fairies quietly came to the gate of the villa at the end of the lane. In the dim light, the dilapidated doors and walls could still be discerned. The cold wind was whizzing, and it seemed that the shady wind was blowing from inside. On Monday, Xian shrank his neck. It seems to be a little chilly. The wild dog Taoist priest standing behind him also has some hair in his heart. However, he looks at him quietly and sees the beautiful figure of Xiaohuan standing beside him. His face is also a nervous look. When he was staring at the darkness, the little flinch in the wild dog Taoist priest&rsquo;s mind disappeared.</p>
<p>Monday immortal looked at the dark place for a long time and seemed to be thinking about something. After a long time, he turned around and took out some yellow paper symbols from his arms. On them, we could see the crooked and obscure pictures, and we couldn&rsquo;t see what it was in the dark. Zhou Yixian handed two pieces to Xiao Huan, hesitated for a moment, then reached out and handed two pieces to the wild dog Taoist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These two talismans, the big one, you can hide it close to you, and the small one will be held in your hand. In case something is wrong, you can immediately recite the mantra and wave it, and then you can escape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that, Monday fairy whispered the mantra to both of them. Xiaohuan had already known this mantra before and nodded. The appearance is relaxed, but the wild dog Taoist is listening to a lot of big head, Monday fairy these strange incantations is he has never heard, the voice is obstinate. Among them, there are seven and eight fold, which is extremely difficult to remember. The wild dog Taoist almost all doubted that if something really happened, he would have died in the hand of Mr. ghost before he finished reciting these incantations.</p>
<p>But anyway, although I don&rsquo;t know whether the magic of the swindler on Monday immortal this time works or not. After all, the Taoist priest of wild dog wrote it down with his heart. After a cup of tea, he could not easily memorize this extremely obstinate mantra.</p>
<p>Monday immortal listened to the wild dog Taoist repeat it again and nodded, indicating that it was OK. This time, he taught him how to escape, but he didn&rsquo;t lose his temper and swear. I don&rsquo;t know if it is because he knows that his incantations are too difficult to remember. When next Monday, the immortal calmed down and pointed to the door of the villa. Xiao Huan and Taoist wild dog nodded at the same time.</p>
<p>Zhou Yixian inhaled deeply, then slowly raised his feet and walked forward. Xiaohuan and the wild dog Taoist followed him. The night was deep and dark in front of him. It was really strange. In this tense moment, suddenly in the distance behind the three people, faintly heard a few calls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cheep, cheep&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sound is similar to the usual insects. Neither Monday immortal nor the wild dog Taoist priest paid attention to it. However, Xiaohuan&rsquo;s body suddenly vibrated. She suddenly turned around and looked back. She turned so fiercely that the two men around her were startled. She thought there was something unexpected behind her. She turned around to check, but found that there was nothing behind her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Xiao Huan, what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; he said</p>
<p>Xiao Huan&rsquo;s face was changeable and strange. After a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, he said, &ldquo;grandfather, I and I seem to hear Xiao Hui calling.</p>
<p>&quot;</p>
<p>Zhou Yixian frowned and said, &ldquo;Xiaohui, what little ash&hellip;&rdquo; His voice suddenly choked and whispered, &ldquo;do you mean the monkey around GUI Li?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan nodded, but her face was a little confused. She said slowly, &ldquo;but now there is no sound. Is it because I heard something wrong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Monday fairy and wild dog looked at the lane at the same time, only to see a dark, where there is ghost and small gray shadow? On Monday, I don&rsquo;t know, but I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s on my face?</p>
<p>The wild dog Taoist priest looked at the dog&rsquo;s face and lowered his head slowly.</p>
<p>On Monday, the fairy said, &ldquo;well, don&rsquo;t think about it. Let&rsquo;s go in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Huan and the wild dog Taoist both nodded and agreed. Next Monday, the three fairies crept to the door of the dilapidated house. In the dark, the grass and trees in the small courtyard were desolate and dilapidated. It was dark everywhere, and there was nothing. But it seemed that behind every shadow, there was a pair of cold eyes looking at them.</p>
<p>When the cold wind blows, it&rsquo;s really ghostly and makes the hair stand on the back.</p>
<p>On Monday, the fairy swallowed his mouth and walked in lightly. In the silence, though they had been extremely careful, they still made a very slight footstep sound. In their own ears, it seemed to be louder than usual.</p>
<p>As the three people get closer to the mansion, their heart beats are fast. Xiaohuan even feels that his heartbeat is so loud that he is afraid that others will listen to it.</p>
<p>It was at this time that in the originally dark mansion, a sound suddenly sounded. Although it was slight, it was like thunder in people&rsquo;s ears at the moment. A flame light suddenly lit up from the room, and the color of the flame was strangely dark green (to be continued. )</p>
