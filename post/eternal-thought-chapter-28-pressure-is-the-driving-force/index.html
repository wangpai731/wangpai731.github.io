<p>Bai Xiaochun was also stunned. Looking at the exclamation of people around him, and looking at Zhao Yiduo and Chen Ziang, who were swept away in the distance, it seemed that they did not care about the whole body pain. They ran over again quickly. The whole person was lying on the top, where they studied carefully.</p>
<p>In particular, elder Zhou, one by one, looked excited, with incredible, more ecstatic.</p>
<p>Such a crazy picture makes Bai Xiaochun feel frightened. At the same time, he thinks that everyone is crazy. He thinks that it is just a few pillars. According to his idea, it is planned to grow to ten feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elder&hellip;&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun stepped back and called out tentatively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good, good!&rdquo; Zhou Changlao laughs and caresses the Lingdong bamboo. Every inch of the place is not missed. It seems that he has not heard Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This kind of Lingdong bamboo is extremely rare. Only when it grows to five Zhangs long, can the whole body be dark green. This kind of Lingdong bamboo is not only a herb, but also the main material for refining Lingzhu sword. It can also inspire some special skills!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After smelling the smell of bamboo, you can smell it Elder Zhou opened his mouth excitedly and even took a deep breath.</p>
<p>Chen Ziang and Zhao Yiduo looked very serious and smelled them. The other disciples around him, who were close to each other, did not smell it.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun coughed. He smelled the smell on the way to the road carrying bamboo and wood. It was clearly The taste of chicken bones, after all, the bones of hundreds and thousands of Lingwei chickens are buried in the holy field where these Lingdong bamboos are planted And every one of them was chewed by him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elder&hellip;&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun thought these people were crazy and called out again.</p>
<p>But at this time, all of a sudden, elder Zhou&rsquo;s whole body suddenly shocked, staring at a piece of bamboo on a piece of area, eyes suddenly showed anger, look distorted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn it, what&rsquo;s going on here? How can there be a trace of being bitten off? The Lingdong bamboo is extremely bitter and can&rsquo;t be eaten raw. Which son of a bitch has bitten this one and destroyed its quality!&rdquo; Elder Zhou lamented, as if on a piece of perfect jade, suddenly appeared a wormhole like feeling, suddenly looked up at Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not me!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun retreated in fright. Suddenly, he remembered that when he was hungry for the first time, he seemed to gnaw at the bamboo without any choice. However, he did not expect that the place where the task was handed over was so terrible. What happened to the bamboo that he raised, what happened to him? These people were crazy.</p>
<p>Hearing Zhou&rsquo;s words, many people around looked at the past. As expected, on the last Lingdong bamboo, they saw a trace of being bitten.</p>
<p>After all, he was a foundation builder. Although he was obsessed with medicine, he still had some determination. However, the bamboo that Bai Xiaochun brought was really amazing. Especially the variation, which Zhou had never heard of before, gave rise to a scene of just now abnormal.</p>
<p>He took a deep look at Bai Xiaochun and shook his big sleeve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This bamboo is of superior quality No, it&rsquo;s the best. It should be listed as the best, and 10000 contribution points will be awarded! &quot; When he said this, people in four weeks took a breath again. We should know that the ordinary planting task, that is, around 10 o&rsquo;clock, is only 100 contribution points at most. Now it is ten thousand!</p>
<p>The children on one side also stayed. For many years, Lingxi sect has been listed as the best Lingzhi, which is extremely rare.</p>
<p>For the first time in hundreds of years, at least.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun is excited. He quickly comes to the boy, takes out his identity token and urges him. The boy hesitates for a moment. Seeing that Zhou Changlao starts to study the bamboo again, he grits his teeth and gives Bai Xiaochun ten thousand contribution points.</p>
<p>With the contribution point, Bai Xiaochun quickly left here, he decided not to come again next time, the people here are too crazy.</p>
<p>Before he could walk far away, the voice of Zhou was heard behind him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bai Xiaochun, my name is Bai Xiaochun, my uncle is Li Qinghou!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun quickly opened his mouth. Before he came, he didn&rsquo;t know that the bamboo was so amazing. At the moment, he was more or less worried, so he took Li Qinghou as tiger skin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hum, there are many tricks. Lingxi sect has a long history and a large number of disciples. Everyone has his own secrets and has his own nature. I will not leave my face to ask the truth. If you have such bamboo in the future, I will accept all the bamboo and make contribution to your satisfaction.&rdquo; Elder Zhou was a little displeased. He waved his hand and ignored Bai Xiaochun. He continued to study the bamboo. As for the handover of other disciples on this day, they all ended in advance.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun took the identity token with excitement in her eyes. After leaving the mission Pavilion, Bai Xiaochun went straight to the miraculous medicine Hall of Xiangyun mountain. This so-called miraculous medicine hall is the place where Xiangyun mountain&rsquo;s disciples exchange for miraculous medicine.</p>
<p>If you have a miraculous medicine, you can also sell it to zongmen here in exchange for contribution points.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun came here at a gallop and chose from around in the miraculous medicine hall. After a long time, he had bought a bottle of elixir suitable for five layers of gas condensation. The price of the pill was high. Bai Xiaochun thought that his contribution to 10000 yuan had been great, but he did not expect that the miraculous medicine here was more expensive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Qingshen contains miraculous elixir.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun looked at the pill bottle in his hand. There were three pills in it, which cost him more than 4000 contribution points.</p>
<p>However, this pill is not the medicine of ordinary congealing Qi disciples. It has remarkable effect. It is not only more effective than ordinary miraculous medicine, but also has the effect of pure aura.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun thinks that the fifth layer of condensate is not safe, so he plans to break through to the full surface of the fifth layer of condensate this time.</p>
<p>As for the sixth layer of condensate gas, he thought of using this method to avoid fighting, but if he did, Bai Xiaochun could imagine that Li Qinghou would certainly change his method and continue to punish himself.</p>
<p>As for the rest of the contribution points, Bai Xiaochun did not waste, all in exchange for the protection of a one-time charm, these things on his body, he felt a little more secure.</p>
<p>If it was not for his insufficient contribution, he would like to go to the treasure pavilion to exchange some magic weapons for condensing gas. Now he had to give up. When he returned to the yard, Bai Xiaochun sat in the wooden house with his eyes fixed, took out the pills and looked down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In less than three months, I&rsquo;m going to close down!&rdquo; As soon as he gritted his teeth and observed for four weeks, he pinched a finger with his right hand, and immediately the turtle shaped pot appeared. He took out the tail of the Lingwei chicken. In a flash, the three color fire appeared.</p>
<p>One tail could not meet the needs of turtle shaped pot. The first three lines were bright after ten tails were used. Bai Xiaochun refined all three pills three times in one breath.</p>
<p>Then he took a grain of Qingshen Lingyun pill with three silver stripes and swallowed it.</p>
<p>The entrance of the pill immediately melted, and the majestic aura erupted. Bai Xiaochun immediately followed the movement and breath of Ziqi to control the tripod, concentrating on guiding the movement of aura in his body.</p>
<p>A few days later, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s wooden house was shocked, and there were countless dust flying. It seemed that the impact spread from the inside to the outside. A moment later, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s laughter came out of the wooden house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five layers of condensate gas!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun took a deep breath, and his eyes showed the essence. He had eaten so many Lingwei chicken before. He had already had the four layers of condensation gas, and swallowed a pill, which made a very smooth breakthrough and became the fifth layer of condensed gas.</p>
<p>After cleaning, Bai Xiaochun didn&rsquo;t swallow the pill immediately, but his cultivation was steady. Five days later, he swallowed the second Qingshen Yinling pill, which had been refining for three times. This time, the spirit was filled in his body, and his spiritual pulse was more broad. It flowed through his body, making his cultivation power rise again A lot.</p>
<p>After a few days of stabilization, he swallowed the third Qingshen Yunling pill, and with one breath, he directly impacted his accomplishments to the level of five layers of condensation gas.</p>
<p>At this time, his actions and actions, the whole person looks different from before, the skin is whiter, even more unique temperament.</p>
<p>This makes Bai Xiaochun very happy. He also knows that if other disciples swallow the three pills, they will break through to the fifth layer of condensate gas at most. It is impossible for him to achieve the great perfection of the fifth layer of condensate gas. It seems that it is only one step away from the sixth layer of condensate gas.</p>
<p>The key point in this is the refining of turtle shaped pot.</p>
<p>With Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s practice, the efficacy of this thing is more and more revealed, which makes Bai Xiaochun more than once curious about the origin of the turtle shaped pot.</p>
<p>It looked like a turtle shell, but he found that it was not.</p>
<p>He has also made it clear that there is a special place for soul refining on ziding mountain. After making some contributions, he can ask the elders of the sect to help with the refining. The palm of ziding mountain is said to be a master in the field of soul refining.</p>
<p>Touching the lines on the back of the turtle pot, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s eyes flickered. After a moment, he shook his head. Since he didn&rsquo;t understand, he simply ignored it. Instead, he raised his right hand and saw a green jade pendant and a wooden sword in front of him.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun looks at her only two magic tools. She bites her teeth and takes out the spirit tail again. She is ready to refine the two items three times.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what will happen to the wooden sword and jade pendant after three times of soul refining.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun waved his right hand. After the three lines of turtle pattern pot were lit up, the jade pendant went straight to the pot. After the silver light flashed in an instant, bursts of thunder like roar came out. Fortunately, the spread was not far away, but few people paid attention to it.</p>
<p>Until the silver light dissipated, there were three more lines of silver on the blue jade pendant in front of Bai Xiaochun. The silver patterns were shining and gradually dim. However, Bai Xiaochun clearly felt that the breath on the jade pendant was quite different from that before, just like the difference between heaven and earth.</p>
<p>Even faint, blue, there is a trace of purple light, in this jade pendant like inlay, and even the shape of the jade pendant has changed some, no longer oval, are more flattened, as if to become a circle.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun picked up the jade pendant. After the aura melted in, he immediately saw a blue halo around him. It was more than three feet thick. It looked amazing.</p>
