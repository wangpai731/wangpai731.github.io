      <p>It looks like an endless torrent of monsters, which rush on like waves after wave. With those huge monsters as arrows, they hit the light curtain of people in the right way. Seeing the light curtain crumbling, it seemed that the young disciples&rsquo; faces were beginning to show some fear. Xiao Yicai frowned, knowing that if they didn&rsquo;t repel these monsters, they would be out of control.</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai immediately gave a big drink and called on the disciples around him. First, he rushed to a huge demon beast nearby. But he was still in a few steps. Suddenly, a gust of wind swept behind him. A figure rushed out of his side like lightning, and went straight to the demon beast.</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai took a look at the figure and was stunned for a moment. Although the figure was dyed bright red, it was graceful, cool and gorgeous. It was Lu Xueqi. But seeing in the light curtain of countless black demons and righteous disciples, Lu Xueqi seemed to go up against the wind and rushed to the demon beast which was dozens of times larger than her own body.</p>
<p>There was another figure beside him, but it was Zeng Shushu. He was once pretty. Now he was stained with blood. He said to Xiao Yicai in a hurry: &ldquo;elder martial brother Xiao, let&rsquo;s go and help her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai quickly nodded and rushed up. The huge beast demon opposite them is the huge white bone demon snake that once appeared in the qilidong of Miao people in southern Xinjiang. Under the black clouds, its skeleton presents a strange pale color, and the three pairs of colorful wings that constantly vibrate behind are directly connected to the white bone, which is even more bizarre.</p>
<p>At the moment, the White Bone Demon snake coiled up its huge body nearly three feet long, shaking the three pairs of wings above the skeleton behind him. The snake letter on the head of the snake kept breathing and puffing out a stream of black gas, and glared at the light curtain of the right path. Every time when it is swept by a giant, there will immediately be a righteous disciple with a slightly lower moral integrity who dies. Either he is bitten to death by this giant mouth, or he can&rsquo;t stand the black poison gas, and he dies.</p>
<p>The White Bone Demon snake killed many people and looked at the righteous disciples who were scattered in front of him. The mouth opens and closes, although does not have the muscle the face to be unable to see any expression, but obviously arrogant already extremely. Just at the moment of its pride, the white shadow flashed in front of him. It seems that there is a light drink, the voice is cold, a beautiful woman appears in the sky, the blue fairy sword in her hand twinkles brilliantly, and cleaves from the sky.</p>
<p>There was a roar from the bones of the White Bone Demon snake. He didn&rsquo;t mean to give in at all. He looked at the Tianya sword as if it was nothing. He opened his mouth and exposed two big white fangs, and bit Lu Xueqi.</p>
<p>Seeing that the fangs, which seemed to be bigger than human beings, flashed cold white light and fell from the sky. Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s face was still cold in the face of this terrible scene, without any expression, and it seemed that she did not put the White Bone Demon snake in her eyes. The light of Tianya divine sword was more brilliant, and it soared into the sky. In a black air, it was like a phoenix crowing nine days. In an instant, it cut off the black gas and split the dark clouds. Before the White Bone Demon snake made a response, it cut the bone three feet under the head of the White Bone Demon snake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hiss Card</p>
<p>The deep muffled sound seemed to burst out from the depth of the figure. At first, it was a low voice, but in the twinkling of an eye, it was like the roar of a beast. The White Bone Demon snake was stunned for a moment and stopped attacking temporarily. Looking down, I saw the chest white bone, in the vicinity of Tianya hit bones suddenly appeared light cracks, and then rapidly expanded. For a moment there was a crackling sound, and the splash smashed away.</p>
<p>Tianya divine sword is a nine heaven divine weapon. Even if it is such a unique monster, it is also hurt by Tianya sword.</p>
<p>The White Bone Demon snake gave out an earth shaking roar, and two groups of fire like flames suddenly appeared in the eyes of the deeply sunk face, which was obviously extremely angry. At present, they are not concerned about others. The giant swings and pours directly at Lu Xueqi.</p>
<p>In the twinkling of an eye, Xiao Yicai, Zeng Shushu and others have already arrived. They shout in unison, and the magic weapon and immortal sword fly at the same time, and together with Lu Xueqi Tianya divine sword, they resist the thunderous blow of the White Bone Demon snake.</p>
<p>However, Xiao Yicai and others were shocked and almost beaten down from the air. Fortunately, all of them are outstanding among the younger generation. They are not only good at their deeds, but also have lost their color when they look at each other. The power of these monsters is so strong that it is hard for them to join hands, let alone behind it There is also a mysterious beast God.</p>
<p>Looking at the White Bone Demon snake, although it shocked all the people, they were not ordinary people, and they had no magic weapon. Several blue, white and yellow strange things darted up and hit the head of the White Bone Demon snake heavily. One of the creatures cracked a small bone. The White Bone Demon snake roared again, and the ghost fire was more powerful in his eyes. He attacked again with almost no rest. Obviously, he hated these people very much.</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai, Lu Xueqi, Zeng Shushu and others were flying in succession. The White Bone Demon snake was too powerful to block its edge in any case. In addition, with the huge mouth attack, a thick black poisonous gas was spewed out of its mouth. People could not smell it from afar. Now, relying on their flexible body, they surrounded the monster&rsquo;s huge body.</p>
<p>At the moment, there are six huge monsters on the side of the monster. However, after the initial panic, the elite disciples headed by Xiao Yicai and others, at least a few people, or more than a dozen people, will defeat these monsters. Although due to the strength of the demons, they can&rsquo;t win, but most of them are struggling, but eventually the situation is stabilized. Without the fighting power of these huge monsters, facing ordinary beasts and demons, the righteous disciples had a strong courage. The original chaotic situation gradually stabilized, and the light curtain began to stabilize again.</p>
<p>Outside the Yuqing hall, daoxuan Zhenren and others were dignified and their brows were locked. They could see that the war situation was fierce, and how many creatures lost their lives in the bloodbath. Immortal daoxuan watched the battle situation at the foot of the mountain and saw that among the crowd, the monsters that seemed to be killing them were still nothing but the six giant monsters. At the moment, they seemed to be more and more brave. With Xiao Yicai and other outstanding disciples, they were more than enough to fight against. At the moment, they were also slowly showing a declining trend and could not resist it.</p>
<p>Daoxuan looked solemn and looked for a moment. Then he looked up again and looked at the sky again. The endless black clouds in the sky were rolling and moving lower and lower.</p>
<p>Yun Yilan coughed at his side and said in a low voice, &ldquo;elder martial brother daoxuan, this situation is not&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not continue to say, but the real man daoxuan was naturally aware of what kind of character he was. Moreover, the current situation of the war was really tight. He turned his head and nodded to Yun Yilan and said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t worry about the valley master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After saying that, he turned to look behind him and saw that behind them were dozens of elders in the right way. These people are either gray haired or immoral, so to speak, the elders of Qingyun gate and the predecessors of other veins. It&rsquo;s the last battle power of the right path.</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan was silent for a long time, and finally said slowly: &ldquo;everybody, go down!&rdquo;</p>
<p>No one spoke out, just with the words of Taoist immortal daoxuan, the last dozens of people. Or nodded slightly, or bowed in return, and then the light suddenly flickered, the last dozens of elders in the right path simultaneously soared into the air and flew down the mountain.</p>
<p>Outside the Yuqing hall, in addition to the Taoist immortal, master Puhong and Yun Yilan, there are still six people standing, but they are the head of the six veins of Qingyun gate except Tongtian peak. They unexpectedly did not join the battle group.</p>
<p>Daoxuan faced them. Nodding his head, he said, &ldquo;it seems that the situation has reached a critical juncture. I&rsquo;d like to ask you for the matter originally planned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Among the six channels, Qi Hao and other newly appointed young people have always been respectful in front of him. Only Tian Buyi, Zeng Shuchang and master Shuiyue have a peaceful look. After hearing the instruction of immortal daoxuan, others seem to have known about this and have no expression of astonishment. Only the field is not easy to face some haze.</p>
<p>At present, the six people all saluted daoxuan immortal, and then they flew in different directions. I&rsquo;m flying back to my own mountain range. Only Tian Bu Yi doesn&rsquo;t know why, but he stops for a moment and looks at Taoist immortal.</p>
<p>The real man daoxuan was surprised and said, &ldquo;brother Tian, what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi hesitated and lowered his voice. &ldquo;Master, elder martial brother, after the seal of heaven is opened, the ancient sword of killing immortals is full of ferocity, and the power of counterattack is too strong. You must be careful, and don&rsquo;t want to live late and live a bad life&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan was silent for a moment. He nodded and said, &ldquo;brother Tian, you and I have known each other for many years. I understand what you mean. Don&rsquo;t worry, even if something happens, for the sake of the world, you can&rsquo;t care so much! &quot;</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi&rsquo;s muscles twitched for a moment, but he didn&rsquo;t say anything more. He looked at the face of Taoist immortal daoxuan and nodded. His sleeve robe trembled, and the red and yellow light flashed. He lifted him up and flew to the sky, but he went to the direction of dazhufeng.</p>
<p>At the back of Tongtian peak, the sound of fierce struggle is faintly heard from the front mountain. The mist is dispersed and the birds are singing. It seems that there is another world. But the same thing is, even in this quiet place, there are still swords and swords, bloody fighting.</p>
<p>The light of the green sword seems to tremble slightly, as if mourning something. The old man lost his vitality and lay quietly on the ground with his head askew to one side. Kneeling beside him, Lin Jingyu&rsquo;s face is scarlet and terrifying. His eyes are full of rage. His teeth are deeply clenched. It seems that although he is silent, he seems to be in the silence with a faint sense of madness.</p>
<p>In the shadow of the woods, the black ghost still did not leave. He looked at Lin Jingyu&rsquo;s figure behind his back like a ghost. His eyes turned from Wan Jian&rsquo;s lifeless body to see Lin Jingyu, and finally fell on the Dragon chopping sword. Then, he suddenly seemed to think of something, turned his head and looked in the direction of the magic moon cave.</p>
<p>That road, cold and lonely, lonely to extend forward, can not see any movement.</p>
<p>Under the black veil, no one could see Mr. ghost&rsquo;s expression.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu&rsquo;s mind is in chaos at the moment, and WAN Jianyi&rsquo;s sudden murder makes him fall into a state of mind that is almost crazy. Ten years ago, after the chaos of Qingyun and the betrayal of his teacher Cangsong Taoist priest Qingyun, Wan Jianyi suddenly appeared. What he learned and his demeanor and breadth of mind became the people that Lin Jingyu respected in Dudu. For ten years, under the cultivation of ten thousand swords, he has cultivated this mysterious old man as a half master and half father.</p>
<p>But at this moment, the man he most respected had become a corpse, lying in front of him, and he didn&rsquo;t even know who the murderer was, let alone avenge him. Sadness, pain and despair stimulate Lin Jingyu&rsquo;s extreme temperament, which makes him look more and more crazy.</p>
<p>At this time, suddenly from behind the woods, came a strange noise.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu&rsquo;s body was shocked. He turned around and looked at him. He saw a shaking in the woods. Unexpectedly, a figure suddenly appeared from the forest, and then he swept it out as fast as lightning. The speed is amazing. Lin Jingyu and other cultivation eyesight can only see fuzzy shadow.</p>
<p>Now, what does it mean to be a mysterious person suddenly appearing here?</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu&rsquo;s body moves faster than his brain. Almost at the same moment, he seized the sword of cutting the dragon, and chased him with his avatar. He did not think that this man was really a murderer. How terrible a man would be if he could kill Wan Jian Yi. In Lin Jingyu&rsquo;s heart at the moment, there is no other thought except revenge. Moreover, as soon as Wan Jian taught him for ten years, the Dragon chopping sword has always gone forward bravely and never retreated, just like their life!</p>
<p>The shadow was in a very fast shape. Flash has left the ancestral hall, in the fork in the road slightly pause for a moment, &ldquo;whoosh&rdquo; sound, awe inspiring to the path of the magic moon cave.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu ran after him in a twinkling of an eye. Looking at the faint figure, he did not think much about it. His body was like electricity. He rushed into the path which was supposed to be the forbidden area of Qingyun disciple, and rushed towards the direction of magic moon cave.</p>
<p>The mountain wind is blowing. The top of the branches swayed gently and made a rustling sound. It soon fell into silence. Only the desolate old man lay quietly on the ground, looking at the clouds in the sky, quietly flowing through.</p>
<p>Although Lin Jingyu tried his best to catch up with him all the way, he still couldn&rsquo;t catch up with the figure. The trees on both sides quickly retreated behind them, but the shadow in front of them was still looming. At the moment, Lin Jingyu&rsquo;s original anger subsided slightly, and he could not help but feel frightened.</p>
<p>It is conceivable that the mysterious figure has a high moral conduct, but even so. Lin Jingyu still did not slow down at all, still full of chase, but just in the corner ahead, the light dark shadow suddenly rushed forward, did not enter the dead corner of the mountain, disappeared in the sight.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu is frightened and anxious. All out, the whole body is like an arrow from the string. It jumps straight and flies forward with a &ldquo;whoosh&rdquo; sound. On the way, because of the urgency of the situation, there is a screeching sound. Only when he got to the corner of the mountain, although it was only a moment, the dark shadow had disappeared. In front of him, it was a common cave with four big characters engraved on it: the magic moon cave!</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu was startled and stopped. He has been in the Qingyun gate for many years. Naturally, he did not know that this is the Qingyun forbidden area, which has always been forbidden to the Qingyun disciples. Now, it is a big crime for him to enter the forbidden area privately. But when he looked around, he saw the ancient trees around him, and there was nothing different except this cave. The figure disappeared like this.</p>
<p>His face was constantly changing, and the color of hesitation flashed, but his star eyes glittered, and the color of anger still prevailed. He raised his steps as if hesitating, but after a moment he took the first step forward and walked towards the cave.</p>
<p>On the contrary, Lin Jingyu walked slowly and slowly, as if there was something in the ordinary cave that made him hesitant, but even so, he quickly walked to the cave entrance. After deeply breathing in, Lin Jingyu bit his teeth and walked in.</p>
<p>The cave is very small, almost all the places can be seen at a glance, without any trace of human beings.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu was stunned for a moment, and a trace of disappointment flashed on his face, but then his eyes fell on the only conspicuous place in the cave: the Taiji pattern inlaid on the stone wall.</p>
<p>The Tai Chi map reflected in his eyes seems to be telling him about the vicissitudes of time, and the broken edge exudes a long smell. Lin Jingyu stares at the Taiji diagram. After a long time, he slowly reaches out his hand and puts it on the diagram.</p>
<p>The material of non stone and non jade, with a trace of rough feeling, sharpened the edge of his palm, without any reaction. Lin Jingyu, with bright eyes, tried hard to turn to the side.</p>
<p>Without any omen, even the stone wall itself has not changed at all, but suddenly from that Tai Chi pattern, a blazing air comes out, which instantly attacks Lin Jingyu&rsquo;s arm. It seems that the whole body is not as red as the blood in the whole body.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, such an ordinary Tai Chi pattern here has such an amazing prohibition of Taoism. Lin Jingyu was shocked and subconsciously wanted to retract his arm. Unexpectedly, the arm was firmly absorbed by the invisible force, and he wanted to withdraw his hand but could not get it. At the same time, a dull sound suddenly began to come out of the cave wall around him, as if something had been disturbed, and he was about to wake up from his deep sleep.</p>
<p>The strange noise around him became louder and louder, and gradually gathered to Lin Jingyu&rsquo;s body. However, after a short time in front of the palm of his hand, it was too hot to bear. Lin Jingyu was terrified. His teeth clenched, and his body was almost bursting with the heat. He had to use his whole body of Taoism to fight against it. He tried his best to pass the Taiji Xuanqing Daoism of Qingyun gate to the palm of his hand, hoping to resist the mysterious heat.</p>
<p>At the critical moment when Lin Jingyu&rsquo;s head was dizzy and his whole body was roasted by the hot light, suddenly, the mysterious heat in the Taiji pattern receded, and the castration was very fast. It disappeared from Lin Jingyu like a tide, which even made Lin Jingyu unable to recover for a moment.</p>
<p>Then, the strange noise around seemed to be soothed, and gradually calmed down, and the quiet atmosphere returned to the cave. With Lin Jingyu&rsquo;s dismay, the Taiji pattern turns at the same time, and the low voice, which is different from that just now, comes out from the stone wall again.</p>
<p>In Lin Jingyu&rsquo;s surprised eyes, the stone wall, which was originally connected into a piece of stone without any cracks, was turned to the two sides, revealing a very strange hole. On top of the hole, the strange gas in the shape of water mist was spinning rapidly, and the inside was hazy and unpredictable. (to be continued. )</p>
