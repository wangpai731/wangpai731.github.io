<p>The next day, when the sun rose as usual, all the people of Dazhu peak came to the square and found that the original eight challenge arenas had been demolished, and the rest were arranged in four directions, Southeast, northwest.</p>
<p>Tian is not easy to walk in front of Su Ru. Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s injury seems to get better overnight. He looks flattered when he walks among the people. He looks back and says to Du Bishu in a low voice: &ldquo;six elder martial brother, is the elder martial brother seriously hurt? How can he not move?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Du Bishu shook his head and said: &ldquo;Shifu saw it to elder martial brother in the morning. He said that in yesterday&rsquo;s competition, he was too fierce with elder martial brother Changjian of changmen. He was one main attacker and one main defender. He was wounded in both sides and injured the meridians. He was afraid that his cultivation would be damaged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was surprised and said, &ldquo;even the elder martial brother can&rsquo;t fight him. I&rsquo;m competing with elder martial brother Changjian today. Isn&rsquo;t it not that I was beaten by him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Du Bishu turned his eyes and said, &ldquo;if it&rsquo;s natural according to the common sense, but it&rsquo;s according to the common sense. In the past two days, when you competed, the senior brothers bet that you lost most!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was speechless and had to shut up.</p>
<p>Under the biggest challenge arena in the north, there are lots of people. It&rsquo;s needless to say that Lu Xueqi competed there today. Tian couldn&rsquo;t easily take a look there and hum. He naturally didn&rsquo;t like the person who defeated his daughter. Now he led his disciples to the West challenge arena.</p>
<p>After a few steps, Zhang Xiaofan was shocked to see a group of people in front of him coming from the slant. He was led by an old man who looked like an old man. Beside him, he walked with Zeng Shushu. Behind them, there were 100 fenghuifeng disciples. Zhang Xiaofan saw the group of senior brother Gao, but he did not see Peng Chang.</p>
<p>As if noticing Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s searching eyes, when they passed by, Zeng Shushu suddenly said to Zhang Xiaofan, &ldquo;elder martial brother Peng didn&rsquo;t come, but he was in the residence to recuperate!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan reluctantly smiled, but saw Zeng Shushu&rsquo;s face was grim, and his eyes seemed cold.</p>
<p>The old man who took the lead, of course, was Zeng Shuchang, the first to return to the peak. He took a look at Zhang Xiaofan. Zhang Xiaofan only felt that although the old man&rsquo;s eyes were not sharp, they were very deep, as if he saw his deep heart at one glance.</p>
<p>He can&rsquo;t help but shrink for a moment. At this time, it&rsquo;s not easy to listen to Tian. &ldquo;How are you, elder martial brother Zeng?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shuchang replied: &ldquo;elder martial brother Tian is good. I heard that there is a wizard named Zhang Xiaofan under your sect. He has a unique Taoist method. Yesterday, he had a competition with Peng Chang, my ineffectual disciple, and beat him to death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s face changed and lost his voice. &ldquo;What, elder martial brother Peng is so hurt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as this remark came out, the disciples of fenghuifeng sect were in a state of uproar. They only thought that this man was really vicious and surprised people because he hurt them. They showed that they had no intention or ridiculed Peng Chang.</p>
<p>Uncle Zeng&rsquo;s eyes flashed with anger, but he could not attack the younger generation, so he had to smile coldly and said to Tian, &ldquo;elder martial brother Tian, you are a good apprentice!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian uneasy was frowning. I thought Zhang Xiaofan was too dumb to talk, but hearing Zeng Shuchang&rsquo;s words, he seemed to have a sense of ridicule. Tian uneasy was so strong that he immediately laughed at Zeng Shuchang and said, &ldquo;where is elder martial brother Zeng. Xiaofan, I&rsquo;ve met martial uncle Zeng. &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan a stay, Zeng Shuchang&rsquo;s face is a change, sleeve robe a wave, cold way: &ldquo;no need.&rdquo; Say it and walk away.</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu took a look at Zhang Xiaofan and said lightly: &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t see that you were hidden. I begged elder martial brother Peng to be merciful, but I hurt him instead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was in a hurry and said, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said half of what he said, but Zeng Shushu had turned around and left. When the wind returned to the peak, all the people followed him. Their eyes were cold. Zhang Xiaofan was sad. At this time, he suddenly saw the crowd. Senior brother Gao walked by, but suddenly blinked.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan stayed for a while, but senior brother Gao has gone away.</p>
<p>Tian can&rsquo;t easily take a look at the wind and return to the peak. With a cold smile and a wave of his hand, he leads them to the challenge arena in the west of today&rsquo;s competition. When they came to the nearest place, they found that there were 200 people around here, with their heads raised. It seems that except for Lu Xueqi, the most lively place in Yunhai square is here.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan took a breath of cool air and said quietly to his elder martial brother: &ldquo;so many people, is that elder martial brother Changjian very powerful?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everyone laughed, and he Dazhi said seriously: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s needless to say that elder martial brother is very good at Taoism, but I think most of these people come to see you, younger martial brother!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was surprised and said, &ldquo;how, how can it be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He Dazhi said, &ldquo;up to now, there are only eight people left in the martial arts of seven channels. The biggest black horse is you. Who doesn&rsquo;t want to see how many mouths or hands you have?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan is dumb.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not easy for Tian to take all the people to the stage. All the way up, he saw that they were the main line of Dazhu peak. The crowd retreated one after another and gave way. It&rsquo;s difficult for Tian to look around. He saw that there were many disciples of the changmen in the crowd around him. I think the reason is that there are many changmen&rsquo;s arrows in today&rsquo;s competition. Therefore, there are more changmen&rsquo;s disciples to watch. However, he didn&rsquo;t see a few elders of the changmen.</p>
<p>Tian could not easily frown and murmured to Su Ru, &ldquo;why didn&rsquo;t the elder martial brother of the headmaster come? Are there any other disciples in the long gate competing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru shook her head and said, &ldquo;no, I don&rsquo;t know why this year, the qualification of the disciples in the long school is not very good. Now only Chang Jian is left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not easy for Tian to ponder. He goes to the center of the stage. There are five or six chairs, but only one old man with white beard is sitting there. Seeing that Tian could not wait for others to arrive, the old man also stood up.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was stunned and recognized that the old man with white beard was the one sitting under the stage when he was competing with Chu Yuhong the day before yesterday.</p>
<p>The old man with white beard obviously remembered Zhang Xiaofan. He glanced at Zhang Xiaofan, and then said to Tian, &ldquo;elder martial brother Tian, I can&rsquo;t imagine that you have a talent this year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian uneasy seems to have a good relationship with the old man. He laughs and says, &ldquo;elder martial brother fan is flattered. Please sit down and have a seat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this time, the sound of bells and tripods behind the stage rings. Tian is not easy to turn back and say to Zhang Xiaofan, &ldquo;old seven, you go to the stage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hundreds of eyes in the field came over and fell on Zhang Xiaofan. Zhang Xiaofan has never been stared at by so many people in his life. His face is burning and he says, &ldquo;yes.&rdquo; He turned his head and did not dare to look behind him. He went to the stage.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t take a few steps, but was pulled by Su Ru. Zhang Xiaofan was a little surprised and said, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter, Shiniang?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru smiled a little, but her face was about the color of her arms. She said, &ldquo;does your body hurt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan shook his head and said, &ldquo;master has treated me personally. It&rsquo;s almost all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru shook her head and said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s easy to get hurt, but it&rsquo;s not so fast in the inner world. Xiaofan, the constant arrow that we compete with you today is very important. Your elder martial brother&rsquo;s accomplishments are also defeated by his subordinates. Although your elder martial brother says that it&rsquo;s not good for him to win even if he wins, he&rsquo;s afraid it&rsquo;s still not good because of your half hanging cultivation. Don&rsquo;t try to be brave in the future. If you can&rsquo;t, just admit defeat. Don&rsquo;t risk getting hurt again, OK? &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s heart warmed, but he didn&rsquo;t nod. He just said, &ldquo;master&hellip; Will be angry&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru smiled and shook her head. &ldquo;Silly child, don&rsquo;t worry. Your master loves you too much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan turned his head to Tian hard to see, but Tian couldn&rsquo;t easily talk and laugh with the old man named fan. He didn&rsquo;t look here at all.</p>
<p>Su Ru patted him on the head and said, &ldquo;go ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan slowly walked up to the challenge arena, standing alone on the arena, but Su Ru&rsquo;s words still echoed in his mind: &ldquo;your master loves you, but it&rsquo;s too late!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His mind was in a mess. From childhood to the big, from the beginning of the introduction of Qingyun, Tian was not easy to be in his mind, just like God and man. Although Tian was not easy to treat him well all the time, he always wanted to get the approval of his master.</p>
<p>But at this moment, suddenly listen to the teacher&rsquo;s mother to say this, but he can&rsquo;t believe it for a while.</p>
<p>He thought on stage for a long time, but there was a lot of discussion. After a long time, Zhang Xiaofan finally felt something wrong: his opponent has not come yet.</p>
<p>Under the stage, the disciples of the long gate were particularly anxious. Most of them looked around. At this time, a disciple of the long gate rushed to the old man with white beard in the distance. His face was anxious, and he could not pay attention to the strange eyes of the people around him. He said a few words in his ear.</p>
<p>White beard old man&rsquo;s face is changed greatly, seem to cannot believe, chase to ask: &ldquo;seriously?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The disciple looked at the stage hatefully, and finally nodded heavily. For a moment, the old man with white beard fell down on the chair, his face gray and dejected.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not easy for Tian to see. It&rsquo;s very strange. He said, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter, elder martial brother fan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man with white beard gave him a weak look, sighed for a long time, cheered up, stood up again, and said in a long voice: &ldquo;Chang Jian, a disciple of the long clan, was injured too much in the competition yesterday to get up, so he gave up today&rsquo;s competition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was silence on and off the stage.</p>
<p>A moment later, there was an uproar in the crowd! Although most of the disciples of Qingyun sect are practitioners of Taoism, there are still a lot of people swearing at them. However, the first reaction of Dazhu peak is not surprise, but one looks strange and looks at each other. After a long time, they shake their heads and smile bitterly.</p>
<p>When the people behind changed their expressions and voices, Tian and Su Ru stood up slowly. Looking at the little apprentice who was still on the stage, Su Ru smiled and said to Tian in a low voice, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already said that your little apprentice&rsquo;s luck is not so good!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not easy for Tian to be dumb and smile bitterly.</p>
<p>On this day, Zhang Xiaofan spent his time in the eyes of others. Almost every Qingyun disciple who passed by him had to look at him more, as if he were a rare animal. At the same time, one day later, the results of the competition came out. Zhang Xiaofan was lucky to be in the top four with Qi Hao, Lu Xueqi and Zeng Shushu.</p>
<p>Qi Hao was originally the biggest hit to win the title. Lu Xueqi was very popular these days, but Zeng Shushu and Zhang Xiaofan entered the top four unexpectedly. Before that, Zeng Shushu was known as Zeng Shuchang&rsquo;s only son. Although he was recognized as a young and handsome person in fenghuifeng, he was not very famous in Qingyun gate. This time, he passed the examination and beheaded the general. His Taoism was exquisite, which impressed everyone. Zhang Xiaofan, by contrast, stands in the middle of four people, which is extremely eye-catching.</p>
<p>On the challenge arena, four people stand side by side. Taoist XuanZhen, the leader, and Taoist Cangsong, the first Taoist of dragon head peak, stand in front. Immortal daoxuan still had a smile on his face, and he could not see that he was not dissatisfied with the unexpected army coverage of changmen disciples in the big test.</p>
<p>Under the stage, nearly a thousand Qingyun disciples were gathered, and the first elders of each vein were sitting in the front row. Su Ru looks at the stage and whispers to Tian, &ldquo;Xiaofan is a little nervous!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian didn&rsquo;t sing easily. He didn&rsquo;t speak.</p>
<p>In front of the public, how can his wife see that he can&rsquo;t see? There are four people on the stage, Qi Hao, Lu Xueqi, and Zeng Shushu standing with a smile. Only Zhang Xiaofan stands in the same place and looks at the ground directly. It&rsquo;s embarrassing that he doesn&rsquo;t know where to put his hands.</p>
<p>On the stage, immortal daoxuan glanced at the four people, and a smile flashed across his mouth. He turned to the stage and said: &ldquo;everyone, up to now, the seven pulse martial arts association has determined the first four disciples. They are talented and skillful. They are all the elites of our Qingyun sect, shouldering the responsibility of our Qingyun sect in the future&hellip;&rdquo; he said halfway, and suddenly, I don&rsquo;t know where to spread it There was a &ldquo;poof&rdquo; laugh. A moment later, the crowd of Qingyun disciples burst into laughter.</p>
<p>Real Taoist Xuan frowned and subconsciously squinted at Zhang Xiaofan, the youngest of the four, and shook his head slightly. At this time, the audience laughed constantly, and the solemn scene became a little funny. Taoist Cangsong standing aside, cold faced, took a step, looked like a knife, and swept towards the audience.</p>
<p>The laughter in the crowd suddenly decreased. Taoist Cangsong&rsquo;s eyes went everywhere, and the laughter died out. In a short time, the scene was calm again. Cangsong has been in charge of the punishment of Qingyun sect for many years. He is more powerful than Taoist XuanZhen.</p>
<p>When the scene calmed down completely, Cangsong Taoist retreated and said to daoxuanzhen, &ldquo;master, elder martial brother, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan smiled and said, &ldquo;I have nothing to say, younger martial brother Cangsong, come on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taoist Cangsong nodded, turned to the stage, and said in a loud voice: &ldquo;tomorrow&rsquo;s contest, Qi Hao, the dragon head, wrote to Feng Huifeng, and Lu Xueqi, the little bamboo peak, wrote to Zhang Xiaofan, the big bamboo peak&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cang song is still talking. People&rsquo;s eyes are focused on him. When Zhang Xiaofan arrived, he was relieved. Just now, countless eyes under the stage almost made him breathless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you sweat so much?&rdquo; Suddenly, Zeng Shushu suddenly whispered beside him.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was surprised. Since he won PENGCHANG by accident yesterday, Zeng Shushu was cold to him in front of others. Unexpectedly, he would take the initiative to talk to himself. Although I only know him for three days, Zhang Xiaofan has regarded him as one of his good friends.</p>
<p>At present, he secretly glanced at Zeng Shushu, but saw Zeng Shushu standing at his side, looking down at the stage with a smile, as if he had not said anything just now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fool, don&rsquo;t turn around.&rdquo; Zeng Shu&rsquo;s written expression is the same, but his lips are moving, and he says, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not enough for me to be scolded half dead by my father!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was sorry, and hurriedly turned away his eyes. At the same time, he said in a low voice: &ldquo;sorry, I was&hellip; Ah, elder martial brother Peng, is he OK?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elder martial brother Peng is seriously injured, but it&rsquo;s not a big problem. He will get better in a few days. Otherwise, will I rest with you? But I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re really hiding. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, alas, I didn&rsquo;t know what happened at that time. Most of the time, elder martial brother Peng humbled me, and my head was hot again&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I asked elder martial brother Peng. Although he was defeated, he spoke highly of you. He said that at that time, he practiced with all his strength, and there was no room for him to let him, so you don&rsquo;t have to worry about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was surprised again, and then said, &ldquo;what you said was scolded by your father&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hum, it&rsquo;s not that the fools of senior brother Gao are talkative. They all said what I begged for you from elder brother Peng. Although elder brother Peng spoke for me, he was scolded by his father. Otherwise, I wouldn&rsquo;t do that to you in front of others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip; the books are really wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a small thing. Anyway, I was used to scolding him when I was young. It&rsquo;s your boy&rsquo;s luck&hellip; But I think you should be careful. Next time you compete with the ice beauty of xiaozhufeng, you will be killed by &ldquo;Tianya&rdquo; with one sword! &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan said in a low voice with a bitter face: &ldquo;I know, if I can compete with you&hellip;&rdquo; he stopped in the middle of the conversation. He and Zeng Shushu felt a chill at the same time, and couldn&rsquo;t help looking around. Lu Xueqi, who was standing aside, had cold eyes and didn&rsquo;t know when to stare at them.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was silent when he arrived. Zeng Shushu also took a breath of cool air. They dared not say anything more. They both pretended to listen carefully and listened to Taoist Cangsong&rsquo;s lecture on the stage.</p>
<p>Finally, Taoist Cangsong said, and the crowd dispersed to prepare for the climax of the contest tomorrow.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan and Zeng Shushu came down from the stage, still feeling cool behind them. They couldn&rsquo;t help but feel surprised. Lu Xueqi didn&rsquo;t know whether it was originally from the Arctic ice, which made people cold at a glance.</p>
<p>He was about to say goodbye to Zeng Shushu. He turned to look at Zeng Shushu, but saw that Zeng Shushu suddenly put on his face. His eyes were full of contempt and looked at him. Then he made a big disdain &ldquo;hum&rdquo;. The first one left proudly. Not far away, surrounded by a group of fenghuifeng disciples, his father was standing there looking at them.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan smiled bitterly, turned around and went back to dazhufeng. Tian could not easily see him, saying, &ldquo;go back.&rdquo; Then he took a look at Tian ling&rsquo;er and said, &ldquo;ling&rsquo;er, come here with me. Your mother and I have something to say to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian ling&rsquo;er answered and smiled at Zhang Xiaofan as he left.</p>
<p>When they returned to their residence and arrived in the room, all the people in dazhufeng burst into a pot.
