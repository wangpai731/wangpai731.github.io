      <p>Like the lightning tearing the night and falling into the human world, the light column that gathers the great power of the Dharma falls from the sky, falls from the top of the White Bone Demon snake, and goes straight in from the top of the head. In an instant, a huge force burst out from the huge body, and several Qingyun disciples swimming around were pushed far away by the invisible and qualitative air flow.</p>
<p>The White Bone Demon snake raised its head to the sky and let out a long roar. The huge bones supporting the body suddenly began to emit strange brilliance from top to bottom. A moment later, a tiny sound of &ldquo;KaKa&rdquo; was emitted from countless places, and rays of light were projected from its bones. After that, with a loud noise, the huge body of the demon snake fell down, smashed the hard white jade slab under the body into the old man&rsquo;s deep pit. After struggling on the ground for several times, it finally stopped shaking.</p>
<p>The dazzling light column slowly dispersed, revealing the figures of seven elders, Lu Xueqi, Xiao Yicai and others floating in the sky. Under them, beside the huge monster body, there are bodies everywhere, among which the bodies of four elder Qingyun have been lying down forever. Among the people who are still alive, there are more people who are still alive. Among the younger generation, Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s face is as cold as frost, but her clothes are mostly red. Xiao Yicai is still good. It seems that there is nothing wrong with her. Only Zeng Shushu is strong enough to support herself. When she sees this huge monster finally dies, Fang feels relieved and suddenly her head tilts, but she falls unconscious.</p>
<p>The crowd was startled. Fortunately, Xiao Yicai was at Zeng Shushu&rsquo;s side. He caught his body and looked at him carefully. He was relieved and indicated to others that there was no big obstacle. Then they all relaxed and continued to enter another war.</p>
<p>After dozens of elders of the right path joined the battle group, the situation of this catastrophe war finally developed to the favorable direction of the right path for the first time. Although the number of them is not large, the influence is quite huge. Under the joint attack of ten elders, Xiao Yicai, Lu Xueqi, Zeng Shushu and other young disciples, the monsters, though extremely powerful, were still suppressed by these people and finally killed by all of them. However, these monsters are vicious after all, and they also make the right path pay a heavy price.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just in the middle of this bloody mess.</p>
<p>Who can remember the dead companion?</p>
<p>At the moment when the huge body of the White Bone Demon snake fell down, the people floating high in the sky had turned around and rushed to another battle group without expression, and continued to kill and fight. Xiao Yicai flies to the rear. He put Zeng&rsquo;s book in a quiet place and rushed back. Unexpectedly, Yu Guang saw the place where he had just been. Lu Xueqi seemed to be in a daze, staring at the corpse of the monster. He was pale.</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai was surprised in his heart and called out: &ldquo;sister Lu, what&rsquo;s the matter with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s body was shocked. She seemed to wake up from her dream. In a twinkling of an eye, she saw that her lips moved. She seemed to want to say something. But when she saw that it was Xiao Yicai, she suddenly closed her mouth and took a deep breath. Then Yu Jian flies away and rejoins the war. Xiao Yicai is a little puzzled. She always thinks Lu Xueqi is very strange today. However, when she thinks about this immortal like schoolgirl in the past, she is lonely and indifferent. Moreover, it is the crucial moment of the war. After thinking about it for a while, he puts these thoughts behind him again and rushes into it again.</p>
<p>The dark clouds in the sky rolled and rolled, under them. The wild animals fought fiercely with the people. However, the war situation, after all, is more and more favorable. The expression projected on the faces of the three rightist giants standing high is their original tense facial expressions. Finally, it gradually relaxed.</p>
<p>Despite the heavy cost, after dozens of elders joined the battle, the momentum of the originally irresistible six monsters was immediately blocked, and then gradually suppressed. Under the joint efforts of all, the White Bone Demon snake was the first. Then two other huge monsters were killed one after another.</p>
<p>Although in killing these huge monsters, people in the right path, including the elders, also suffered heavy casualties, but the momentum of the war situation has been gradually reversed. Although the ordinary monster is still black and numerous, but with the death of the huge monster, the momentum also suddenly weakened. Although the ordinary Qingyun disciples are not as good as those outstanding ones in Taoism, they are still more than enough to deal with these ordinary beasts and demons. Moreover, they are also a group of people, and the light curtain is even more indestructible.</p>
<p>After solving half of the huge monsters, more experts besiege the remaining three monsters. Anyone can see that these monsters are the soul of war among the monsters.</p>
<p>However, under the siege of these noble elders and the outstanding young generation, the remaining three monsters could not hold on and fell down in the shrill roar of sharp anger.</p>
<p>There was a great chaos in the demon group. Obviously, this situation made these ignorant demons feel bad. On the contrary, on the right side, the morale was greatly improved, and finally the fighting spirit was high. The bright light curtain was full of light, and pressed outwards. At that time, in the midst of blood and flesh, the beast demon was crushed back.</p>
<p>A panic roar, countless monsters roar to the sky, the sound is sad, the merciless light curtain suddenly comes, what kind of blood light and sadness splash out?</p>
<p>In this countless roars, in the sky, in the sky, the rolling black clouds suddenly stood still, as if the world suddenly solidified, and then, there was such a faint light, transmitted from the dark, silent, dark cloud!</p>
<p>White, tiny shimmer!</p>
<p>In an instant, the black clouds suddenly dispersed, such as a strong wind sweeping the world, blowing through the wind and rain. From the deepest part of the black cloud, suddenly a huge whirlpool whirled outward rapidly. Countless black clouds were swept, and then scattered, leaving no trace.</p>
<p>There is a young figure, appeared, looking at the war-torn mountain top, bloody world, according to high down, like a Legendary God. His black hair fluttered in the wind, and behind him, a black monster, big and small, seemed to move restlessly and roar.</p>
<p>That is, at the moment of his appearance, all of a sudden all the monsters stopped and looked up to the sky and roared at the figure!</p>
<p>Ten thousand beasts roar in the sky, and the black clouds disperse, as if a stream of anger, is rising to the sky, ready to go up to the sky.</p>
<p>All the people in the right path changed color. Taoist immortal stood outside the Yuqing hall, frowning and whispering to himself, &ldquo;is this the animal God?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Magic moon cave.</p>
<p>The dreamlike world!</p>
<p>The moon still hangs in the sky, regardless of the wind and rain. It&rsquo;s always shining. And struggling in this world, as if all scattered, leaving only one person alone, alone confused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who am I?&rdquo; He asked in a low voice. Looking up at the moon: &ldquo;what am I living for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He asked in such a secluded way that he did not know whether to ask the moon in the sky or toward his deep heart.</p>
<p>During this half life, the wind and clouds are surging and the waves are fierce, and the past scenes are surging in my mind.</p>
<p>The familiar characters in life and the people who have been true to each other in my heart are all passing by one by one in my mind. However, they do not leave half a trace, so they go away quietly.</p>
<p>His heart seems unwilling, subconsciously put out his hand, want to grasp something, but the hand in the air, after all, still hold the empty.</p>
<p>Nothing there?</p>
<p>There is only moonlight in the sky. Through countless wind and rain, still fell on his body, according to his lapel.</p>
<p>Falling down, as if tearing off all the appearance of camouflage, in this lonely world, he does not need any strong, wind and rain gradually stop, dust quietly silent, that body, seeing also will not enter this desolate world. To silence.</p>
<p>Die! The old legend, died, there will be no longer painful thoughts, there will no longer be concerned about, even if it is nine hell. In front of Yan Luo hall, who knows what it is like? Prosperous world, may be empty after all!</p>
<p>However, the silent body suddenly shook again, and the moonlight in the sky seemed to shake gently. Then a beam of light fell on the body.</p>
<p>He seemed to struggle!</p>
<p>He seems to be reluctant!</p>
<p>He struggled to get up, and every movement seemed to have exhausted his whole strength. The earth under his feet clearly had endless temptation, which enticed him to lie down and no longer have any worries, so that he could get rid of the pain in the world.</p>
<p>However, he refused to retreat, stubbornly wanted to straighten up. His hands were bleeding and his lips were deeply scarred. In this bleak and desolate world, he still refused to give up.</p>
<p>The moonlight, like the moon, fell on him like a whisper: &ldquo;why do you insist on it! Let go, let go and you will be free&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>He struggled, like a mole ant in the vast world, but in any case, facing the infinite world, he still looked up and looked at the sky!</p>
<p>Slowly stood up.</p>
<p>Familiar face, quietly floating in the heart, the original even between life and death, still can not give up. This life, there are always people concerned about it!</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan, perhaps devilish, the mole ant between heaven and earth, is quietly looking at the sky, gazing at the moon in the sky.</p>
<p>The moon is strange and cold.</p>
<p>He suddenly drank, jumped up, left the boundless land, and went straight to the sky. In front of him, there were three colors of light: gold, blue and red, which suddenly lit up and rushed to the moon with his body.</p>
<p>The moon was cold and silent, but in front of him, suddenly the moon was bright and dim. It was actually a couple who looked at him mercifully and joyfully, as if it had been a rainy night many years ago, just like the joy of the moment when it landed on earth.</p>
<p>If his heart was cut by a sharp blade, he was shivering all over his body, but his body was like an arrow from the string without any intention of shrinking. His three colors were like lightning. Under his gaze, he thrust himself into the couple&rsquo;s body and passed through.</p>
<p>It seems to be blood splashing, but also like wind and rain Xiaoxiao, hit on the face, cold. The figure disappeared, and he seemed numb. Only his eyes are still resolute, toward the moon.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the moonlight is dark again, Tian Buyi and Su Ru&rsquo;s figures appear. Su Ru smiles at him, but Tian Bu Yi hums and whitens him as he remembers.</p>
<p>And between them, Tian linger was smiling like a flower, dressed in red, vaguely 16-7 years old. He laughed and called out: &ldquo;little brother, let&rsquo;s go up the mountain to cut bamboo&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He seemed to suffocate in an instant, and the three figures were in front of his eyes, living in front of him. It was what a shivering feeling, such as the electric light swept over his body, the cold light was getting closer and closer to their figure, and his heart was like the whole being torn apart.</p>
<p>Finally, the three color Miscanthus or wear the past, so hard through the figure. A cool feeling poured down from head to foot. Others were in the air. Their face was as white as paper. Suddenly, they burst out a mouthful of blood with a &ldquo;wow&rdquo; sound, which dyed the chest and skirt red, and there was no trace of blood on the face.</p>
<p>Then, he still looked up, such as indomitable, immortal arrow, toward the moon.</p>
<p>The moon is cold, the sky and the earth are dim, as if there is a sense of desolation, quietly diffuse.</p>
<p>At the time of the electric light and stone fire, I saw that before the moonlight, the misty cloud came. Suddenly, a figure appeared in the cloud.</p>
<p>That is how a figure, deeply engraved in the heart of the figure ah!</p>
<p>He suddenly froze, and his insistence seemed to be about to disperse with the wind, and the vague figure turned in the cloud! It seems to be a green figure, like a sword dance in white!</p>
<p>The soul in his hand was cold and cool. His heart had been so painful for that figure, but at this moment, how should he advance and retreat?</p>
<p>Deep in the night, the cold moon, far above the sky, suddenly came a piercing roar, like a dying beast howling at the moon, full of despair pain.</p>
<p>That brilliant light, flashing three strange rings, rose from the sky, straight into the sky, through the clouds, stabbed into the fuzzy figure!</p>
<p>And then, like something suddenly broke</p>
<p>The wind and rain all over the sky stopped quietly. There were tears in his eyes, staring at the figure. Perhaps close, but he still can not see her appearance, just, far away, as if there is a low sigh.</p>
<p>The wind is gone, the rain is gone!</p>
<p>Moonlight falling like clouds!</p>
<p>Heaven and earth are like water!</p>
<p>His body fell from the sky, as if falling into the abyss, but there was no fear in his heart, and some were just reluctant to give up, staring at the disappearing figure. The next moment, he was on the ground, and all the visions around him disappeared.</p>
<p>At his feet, an ancient and bright mirror, which had broken into pieces, fell from the wall and scattered on the ground. Around him, there are simple cave walls and hard rocks. It&rsquo;s only ten steps away from him to enter the magical cave.</p>
<p>This short ten steps, he seems to have experienced a lifetime, all the painful memories are like this reincarnation.</p>
<p>Then, he gasped and calmed down. When he was about to continue to walk towards the depths of the magic moon cave, he suddenly became stiff, as if he had found something, and then slowly turned around.</p>
<p>With the breaking of the ancient mirror, the magic water mist at the entrance of the cave gradually dissipated, revealing a figure standing behind Lin Jingyu.</p>
<p>Two people&rsquo;s eyes meet in mid air, and they are all in a daze.</p>
<p>For a long time, they looked at them silently. The eyes of the two men, from youth to youth, seemed to have seen through their lives.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu&rsquo;s teeth deeply bit his lips, almost to bite blood, and then word by word he said, &ldquo;did you kill the old man in the ancestral hall?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grimly silent, slightly bowed his head, after a moment, he gently nodded, way: &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu&rsquo;s eyes turned red instantly. (to be continued. )</p>
