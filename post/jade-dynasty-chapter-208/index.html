      <p>South Xinjiang, 100000 mountains.</p>
<p>The cold wind gradually makes people feel cold. The dark clouds in the sky and the gradually obvious deep cave show that the legendary devil&rsquo;s cave is gradually approaching. Lu Xueqi and his party stood more than ten feet away from the zhenmenggu cave and looked at the cave.</p>
<p>In the distance, a stone statue facing the deep of the cave with its back to them stands alone at the entrance of the ancient cave, and there is nothing else.</p>
<p>Looking at the cave, Li Xun seemed a little nervous and said in a low voice, &ldquo;this is it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wind howling, it seems that suddenly raised a few minutes of tone, let people startled. Lu Xueqi, Zeng Shushu, Li Xun and others have profound Taoism. Naturally, they are not afraid of the Yin Qi contained in the Yin wind. The dozen or so disciples of the burning incense Valley who came with them are all experts in one hundred, and they don&rsquo;t look uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Looking back, Zeng Shushu said, &ldquo;the evil spirit is really very heavy here. However, we have been observing for a long time, but there is no monster around. This is a little strange.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi nodded, but the cold spirit never changed. She said lightly: &ldquo;since we are here, we can go there. We can deal with any evil spirits as early as possible.&rdquo; Then, without waiting for Li Xun and others to answer, he went straight ahead.</p>
<p>Li Xun and Zeng Shushu looked at each other. Zeng Shushu gave a dry smile, shrugged his shoulders and followed him. Looking at the graceful figure from behind, Li Xun sighed to himself. For him, the figure had appeared many times in his dream, but when he really had a chance to be together, it seemed to be farther away.</p>
<p>He was silent for a moment, waved his hand, called the younger martial brothers behind him, and followed him.</p>
<p>In the distance, the shadow of the dark wood cave is the shadow of the cave.</p>
<p>Almost with the shadow of black wood to the hole. In the cave, there was a low roar out of the air. It was the voice of the fierce black tiger. Then the illusory smoke in the air began to condense, and the evil spirit was about to appear again.</p>
<p>At this point. Hidden behind the black clothes, black wood suddenly said in a quick voice: &ldquo;brother, don&rsquo;t come out, listen to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The voice of the ferocious black tiger sneered, but the white smoke was still condensing, apparently did not listen to black wood&rsquo;s words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beast, do you dare to come back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Standing in the shadow of a corner of the cave, heimu said, &ldquo;after you appear, you will inevitably disturb these people. There are a lot of people coming to this town today. Don&rsquo;t you know what happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The illusory white smoke suddenly smothered in the air, did not continue to increase, but did not mean to disperse.</p>
<p>After a moment, the black tiger&rsquo;s voice said coldly, &ldquo;what do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They come here,&rdquo; he said coldly. Nature is going to deal with the people in this cave. Anyway, isn&rsquo;t that what you want? What&rsquo;s more, you&rsquo;ve already let people in earlier. Now why don&rsquo;t you let more people in? &quot;</p>
<p>Outside the entrance of the cave, there was a sound of footsteps in the distance. The group of people approached the ancient and deep cave.</p>
<p>The white smoke suddenly dispersed, in the strong wind blowing from the depths of the cave, instantly scattered in the invisible. And almost at the same time, the black figure of black wood also disappeared in the dark.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi, Zeng Shushu and Li Xun appear in front of the entrance of Zhenmo ancient cave at the next moment.</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu looked carefully into the deep darkness of the cave. Eyebrows wrinkled up, obviously for this evil spirit so heavy but so strange place, feel a little uneasy.</p>
<p>Li Xun, who was standing beside him, was somewhat similar to him. He also frowned slightly, but between his looks. His eyes revealed some faint surprise and surprise. He walked back and forth a few steps near the cave mouth, but it was calm. There was no sound except the strong and piercing wind.</p>
<p>This seems to make Li Xun feel a little confused. He stares at the ancient cave of the town of demons, silent, as if thinking about something.</p>
<p>Different from the two men, after arriving outside the cave, Lu Xueqi quickly turned her attention from the deep darkness in the ancient cave to the mysterious and lonely stone statue of a woman beside her. She walked slowly to the stone statue and gazed at it.</p>
<p>The stone statue woman did not know how many years of wind, frost, rain and snow had gone through. From top to bottom, there were traces of erosion everywhere, but it seemed that there was some reaction. Lu Xueqi could clearly see that the stone statue woman&rsquo;s expression was still as vivid as that. Her face was slightly sad, with a sadness. Her eyes seemed to be confused and looked at this silently In the depth of the mysterious ancient cave, what seems to be expecting and talking about?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that in these ten thousand years, who has ever heard her heart talk?</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sister Lu, sister Lu!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly, several exclamations of surprise came from the side. Lu Xueqi was shocked and could not help but step back. She woke up from her inexplicable meditation and looked to the side.</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu was surprised and worried. He said, &ldquo;sister Lu, I&rsquo;ve called you several times. Why don&rsquo;t you seem to hear me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s face turned pale and slowly clenched the hand hanging around her waist. However, she found that she did not know when to start. Her palms were cold sweats. She took a deep breath, calmed down and said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s OK. Did you find anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu shook his head and said, &ldquo;no, there is no trace of a monster except for the strange wind.&rdquo; Then he turned to Li Xun and said, &ldquo;elder martial brother Li, what did you find?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li Xun was silent for a moment. He also shook his head and said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s nothing, but it&rsquo;s really weird here&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu said: &ldquo;strange, what&rsquo;s weird?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li Xun was startled and gave a quick dry smile and said, &ldquo;no, I&rsquo;m surprised to see that this is the lair of animal spirits. How can there be no monsters around here, so I&rsquo;m surprised.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu chuckled and said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s what I said. I just feel strange in my heart! what you think? Sister Lu? &quot;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi didn&rsquo;t answer immediately. The light in her bright and clear eyes slowly flickered, and she took a look at Li Xun.</p>
<p>Li Xun suddenly coughed, turned his head and looked at the other disciples of the burning incense Valley and said, &ldquo;you guys, don&rsquo;t go too far away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi was silent for a moment, then looked back at the stone statue of the woman and said, &ldquo;no matter what. When we come here, there is no reason to give up halfway. Let&rsquo;s go in! &quot;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu nodded and said, &ldquo;not bad.&rdquo; Finish.</p>
<p>He turned to Li Xun and said, &ldquo;what do you mean, elder martial brother Li?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li Xun is still frowning. It seems that he has something difficult to understand at the moment. However, after a moment, he still says, &ldquo;sister Lu is right. Let&rsquo;s go in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu turns around. &ldquo;In this case, let&rsquo;s go in! But it&rsquo;s extraordinary. We&rsquo;d better be careful. Well, I&rsquo;ll take the road first. Younger martial sister Lu, you&rsquo;ll be in the middle. Elder martial brother Li, you&rsquo;ll be dead, and other senior brothers of burning incense valley will walk in the middle, OK? &quot;</p>
<p>Li Xun nodded and was about to agree. Suddenly Lu Xueqi said in a light way: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not right. It&rsquo;s better to change it. '</p>
<p>Both Zeng Shu and Li Xun were in a daze. Zeng Shu said, &ldquo;sister Lu, what do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi pondered for a moment and then said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going ahead. Elder martial brother Zeng is at the end. Other people and senior brother Li are in the middle! Elder martial brother Li and all of you are disciples of the burning incense valley. In case of an accident, there will be a person who can direct the speech. &quot;</p>
<p>Li Xun&rsquo;s face changed slightly. He seemed to want to say something, but Zeng Shushu already said with a smile: &ldquo;ah! So it is. I didn&rsquo;t expect that on this point, younger sister Lu said it was reasonable, so it was settled. &quot;</p>
<p>Li Xun frowned, but he closed his mouth after all. If you don&rsquo;t speak, it&rsquo;s acquiescence.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi looked at him, then turned to Zeng Shu and said, &ldquo;elder martial brother Zeng, you are at the end of the line of sight, so you can see the overall situation. It&rsquo;s in the heart. &quot;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu smiles. Suddenly, from an angle that Li Xun and other disciples of the burning incense Valley can&rsquo;t see, he blinks at Lu Xueqi, and then says with a smile, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t worry, younger martial sister Lu, you won&rsquo;t be afraid of any trouble if you have me. Ha ha ha&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi took a deep look at Zeng&rsquo;s book. Suddenly, a faint smile appeared in her mouth, but then she disappeared. Rao is so, this moment of grace, but has let the distant from time to time secretly look at her burning incense Valley young disciples for it, some people can not help but sigh out.</p>
<p>Li Xun snorted, his face was cold, and suddenly the strange sound disappeared.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s face turned cold again. She looked around and said, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re in.&rdquo; After that, he ignored others and went first.</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu turned to Li Xun and said with a smile, &ldquo;elder martial brother Li, let&rsquo;s go too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li Xun nodded, said hello to other disciples of the burning incense Valley, and followed him.</p>
<p>When Li Xun and others followed Lu Xueqi into the deep darkness, Zeng Shushu did not seem to be in a hurry. He looked at the surrounding scenery for a moment and seemed to be thinking about something. A moment later, with a mysterious smile, he walked slowly into the ancient cave.</p>
<p>The sound of low footfalls reverberated from the darkness, and the entrance of the ancient cave fell into silence again. As the footstep became lower and farther away, and finally disappeared, a figure suddenly flashed in the darkness. Then, the figure of black wood slowly came out of the darkness, and slowly walked to the woman&rsquo;s stone statue, and looked at the stone statue silently.</p>
<p>Behind the black wood, the illusory white smoke slowly floated and condensed, and the huge figure of the ferocious black tiger appeared again.</p>
<p>But at the moment, the evil spirit black tiger didn&rsquo;t immediately speak ill of black wood. Instead, he turned back to the darkness in the deep cave and looked at it for a long time. Suddenly, he sneered and said, &ldquo;these people in the Middle Kingdom are always fighting with each other. Even when they get here, they are still fighting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Black wood turned around and said, &ldquo;people&rsquo;s hearts have always been like this. Don&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s them, it&rsquo;s you and me, even the empress at that time, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; The huge body of the ferocious black tiger suddenly turned around. Because the speed was too fast, it made a dull sound like a wild animal roaring in the air. When he looked at his face, he was full of anger and ferocious. He only heard him roar: &ldquo;what do you say, dare you insult your mother, and you are still in front of the goddess statue?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before this terrible and ferocious body, the body of Blackwood looked very small, but somehow, although he could not see his face clearly, from his calm voice, we could see that he had no fear at all, but more, it seemed that he was deeply tired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elder brother, if my mother didn&rsquo;t have a plan, what do you think could seal the immortal evil spirit in this ancient cave for so many years?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fierce black tiger is obviously one of them, but he obviously doesn&rsquo;t want to admit it. Roared: &ldquo;what are you talking about? That&rsquo;s the mother&rsquo;s Day&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;OK!&rdquo; All of a sudden, black wood was out of his normal and even stopped drinking. Interrupted the evil spirit black tiger&rsquo;s words and said: &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t always hang your mother and mother in your mouth. I&rsquo;m not less than you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The huge body of the ferocious black tiger froze for a moment, and his face showed a trace of astonishment.</p>
<p>After a long time, he didn&rsquo;t get angry, but his face calmed down and looked down at the relative of the previous life.</p>
<p>He suddenly laughed and said, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter with you? You never spoke to me like that before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Black wood sneered at himself, slowly turned his eyes back to the exquisite stone statue of the witch maiden, and said slowly, &ldquo;yes! I never used to talk like that, but why am I now? I don&rsquo;t know myself. Who can tell me? &quot;</p>
<p>The evil spirit black tiger said coldly, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s your own business. I&rsquo;m not interested and I don&rsquo;t want to know. Just tell me one thing. &quot;</p>
<p>Ebony stares at the exquisite stone statue and says, &ldquo;what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The evil spirit black tiger said: &ldquo;it was you who betrayed your mother and left the last precept. You were rebellious. You helped the evil spirit find back the five sacred weapons of the five nationalities in southern Xinjiang and resurrected him. But why did you let me put a man into the hole again today, with the intention of doing harm to him? &quot;</p>
<p>Heiki&rsquo;s eyes never left the exquisite stone statue. After a long time, his voice was low and painful, and he said, &ldquo;the goddess used to seal the animal God. It&rsquo;s a mistake; we follow the empress and ask for the skill of longevity, so it&rsquo;s also wrong to create such monsters; I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s the sin of animal gods. But unexpectedly, he was so angry with all the people in the world that I was wrong. &quot;</p>
<p>He laughed miserably. Suddenly he turned back and opened his arms with a shrill voice. Look up to the sky and shout.</p>
<p>Wrong Wrong Wrong It turns out that we are all wrong&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>The voice of the cry echoed far away, the mountains responded, but the world was indifferent, but as if nothing had changed in general, coldly watching this mortal world.</p>
<p>The huge body of the ferocious Black Tiger stood aside and looked at the suddenly painful figure of black wood. He was silent. He didn&rsquo;t say a word. He just stood behind him. In his eyes, the complicated eyes twinkled slightly, but there was no tear.</p>
<p>Whether he or ebony, in this desolate world, for thousands of years, have already lost the right to cry!</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi, who was walking in the ancient cave, suddenly felt something. She stood still and looked back at the way she used to be. But the road behind her was dark and silent. There was no sound except silence.</p>
<p>Just that a burst of sudden palpitation, in the heart rolling reverberation, for a long time has not been calm.</p>
<p>Li Xun, who was not far behind her, whispered: &ldquo;sister Lu, what&rsquo;s the matter? Have you found anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi in the dark, slowly turned to the front, there, is also a dark.</p>
<p>In the dark, she was silent for a moment, and then quietly said, &ldquo;nothing, keep going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She took a deep breath, lifted her spirits, and walked away. The darkness spread quietly in front of her, because from her hands, the Tianya sword gradually lit up, and the gentle light blue light covered her side, looking like a dream.</p>
<p>Behind him, I don&rsquo;t know how many people hold their breath for a moment.</p>
<p>But, that beautiful figure, resolutely toward the dark road ahead, although looking a bit lonely, but no hesitation.</p>
<p>This section of road, such a life, but how to go through?</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t look back.</p>
<p>Deep in the ancient cave.</p>
<p>The fire was burning quietly in that ancient fire pot. If you look closely, you will find that there is no combustible material such as firewood or lamp oil in the fire pot under the fire light. The burning flame seems to be rootless fire.</p>
<p>The flame flickered in the air, and the tongue of fire shook, illuminating the beast God&rsquo;s face and reflecting the figure of the approaching man.</p>
<p>Ghost Li walked to the other end of the fire, his face in the light, slowly showed out, at the same time saw the familiar face in front.</p>
<p>The animal God, who was still sitting on the ground and leaning against the small stone platform, was smiling. He looked up and down, and said, &ldquo;I know someone will come sooner or later, but I can&rsquo;t imagine that you will be the first one to come here.&rdquo; he paused and said with a smile: &ldquo;it seems that you are not surprised to see my expression just now. Did you know my identity when we met before ？’</p>
<p>GUI Li slowly shook his head, facing this young and gentle man, it is very difficult to associate him with the beast demon who brought great calamity to the whole world. However, it is a fact.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guessed later.&rdquo; He replied faintly.</p>
<p>The beast God looked at him and said gently, &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m very interested. How did you guess my identity from my appearance, my clothes, or my actions?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None of them.&rdquo; The way is fierce.</p>
<p>The beast God seemed to be interested and said, &ldquo;Oh, what is that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li took a look at him and said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>&quot;</p>
<p>The beast God nodded slowly and said, &ldquo;yes, this is the best way. It can&rsquo;t be wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beside him, the evil beast roared.</p>
<p>The God of the beast stretched out his hand. From a distance, he could even see that the hand was very pale. It didn&rsquo;t look like a human hand at all. The withered hand seemed to be the one he saw when he saw the great wizard in qilidong.</p>
<p>However, after the seemingly powerless hand patted a few times, it seemed to get some comfort. Taotie calmed down and slowly lay on the ground. At the same time, monkey Xiaohui, who had been staying on the shoulder of GUI Li, slipped down slowly. He touched his head on the ground and looked at GUI Li and the beast God. It seemed that there was no strong hostility expected between them.</p>
<p>It thought for a while, and then slowly, slowly close to Taotie. Taotie obviously found this too. He turned around and watched the grey haired three eyed monkey approach. Soon, Xiaohui was close to Taotie&rsquo;s side. He grinned and spread out his hands. His tail was still tilted and swayed behind him. Then, he slowly stretched out his hand and felt it on Taotie&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>The sight of GUI Li and beast God was attracted by Xiao Hui for a while, but both of them didn&rsquo;t speak, just watched silently.</p>
<p>Looking at Xiaohui&rsquo;s actions, he suddenly felt a movement in his heart. Once upon a time, many years ago, when he was the ordinary Zhang Xiaofan, Xiaohui was also similar to the rhubarb dog that Tian was not easy to raise on the Dazhu peak.</p>
<p>Taotie slowly straightened his body, but did not immediately stand up, for it, it seems a bit confused. He turned his head and looked at his master, the beast God seemed to be careless, and could not see any displeasure. Then he turned back, and Xiao Hui&rsquo;s eyes and hands were on his head.</p>
<p>In the mouth and nose of gluttonous, suddenly low spurt a snort, seem to be in demonstration. Xiaohui is startled and shrinks his arm back. Then he finds that Taotie doesn&rsquo;t have any attack. He just looks at himself with vigilance in his eyes.</p>
<p>Xiao Hui laughs and jumps twice on the ground. Suddenly, he jumps forward fiercely and jumps to the side of Taotie&rsquo;s body. Taotie was obviously scared, and his body shrank back, but monkey Xiaohui had already touched its head slowly. For Xiao Hui, Taotie&rsquo;s ferocious head seems to be very kind.</p>
<p>Taotie muttered in his mouth, as if he was complaining. But after a moment, he slowly lay down on the ground again, and put his head on his arm, as if he were drowsy. And the small ash also leans on its body, from time to time makes &ldquo;squeak Zhi Zhi&rdquo; light laughter, slowly feels the gluttonous head.</p>
<p>There seems to be no estrangement between the two spirits.</p>
<p>The eyes of ghost and beast God slowly took back from them and were silent for a moment.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how long after that, the beast god suddenly smiles and says, &ldquo;actually, they are happier than us, aren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li didn&rsquo;t speak. (to be continued. )</p>
