      <p>Incense valley.</p>
<p>At the moment, the majestic mountain and river hall is silent. Except for Li Xun and a group of elite disciples who enter the mysterious 100000 mountain noble childe, most of the disciples of the burning incense Valley either patrol the valley Zhongzhong gang or stay in their own rooms to practice their lessons. They seldom come to the main Hall of the burning incense valley. This is also in addition to late at night, the most desolate time of the day.</p>
<p>But at this moment, there are two figures, standing in the gate of the mountain and river hall, standing in silence, overlooking the distant southern sky.</p>
<p>In the distant sky, in the depths of the mysterious and dangerous mountains, there is a huge pillar of fire, rushing up into the sky, with the roaring red magma and black gray thick clouds, which are mixed with countless rock fragments, and are sent high into the sky by the huge force, and then, like a burst, it is sputtering in all directions.</p>
<p>Although far away, but still can feel that resounding between the sky and the earth roar, even at their feet, also vaguely feel the earth in a little shaking. If this is the case thousands of miles away, what kind of unimaginable scene will happen there in the depths of 100000 mountains?</p>
<p>No one knows, at least, the two people standing in the mountain and river hall don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Cloud Yi Lan&rsquo;s face looked very cold, for a long time, he did not even say a word, just silently watched the huge pillar of fire that erupted for a long time, but did not weaken the trend at all. The man standing behind him is his younger brother shangguance. He is also looking at the huge pillar of fire, but his face is more complicated and his expression seems to be cloudy and sunny.</p>
<p>long time.</p>
<p>In the silence, the darkness came quietly, and the sky gradually darkened. During this period, a few disciples passed by, but soon found that there was something wrong with the atmosphere here, so they quickly retreated. Later, when the last glimmer of light in the evening was gradually disappearing, even if they looked far away. The distant vision of the sky is also slowly blurred.</p>
<p>In the distance, a low sound of insects was heard in a corner of the burning incense valley. There is no sound, or far or near, do not know what is calling, but more set off the huge mountain and river hall, it is as cold as ice and snow.</p>
<p>Cloud Yi Lan in the shadow of the body. It moved a little, and then slowly turned around.</p>
<p>Shangguance looks at him in silence. Yun Yilan&rsquo;s eyes contact him in the air for a moment. Then he turns away, slowly turns around and walks towards the mountain and river hall. Shangguan CE sighed in his heart, and finally took a look at the direction of the southern sky, and turned to walk in.</p>
<p>The sound of low footsteps reverberates in the silent mountain and River Palace. But it seems so loud!</p>
<p>Deep footstep sound, I do not know is stepping in whose heart?</p>
<p>Yun Yilan slowly sat down on the seat in the middle of the hall. It was dark, but there was no light. It was not the disciples of the burning incense Valley who were lazy. It was just such a night, but it seemed that it was different. They all knew that they didn&rsquo;t come.</p>
<p>Cloud Yi Lan sits in the dark, looks at the face. After a long time, he suddenly said, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe that someone in the world can actually destroy the ancient cave. Can you kill that demon? &quot;</p>
<p>Shangguan CE sits down at the head of Yun Yilan. Although he is Yun Yilan&rsquo;s younger brother, his face is older than Yun Yilan. At the moment, his voice seems to be more normal than Yun Yilan. A light way: &ldquo;since daoxuan of Qingyun gate could severely damage the beast God, now that someone can figure out a way to kill the beast demon, it&rsquo;s not too surprising.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yun Yilan was silent for a long time and did not speak. But after a long time, he suddenly gave a bitter smile, shook his head, and said, &ldquo;human calculation is not as good as heaven&rsquo;s calculation. After a hundred years of hard work, all his efforts have been wasted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shangguance pondered for a moment. He seemed to be thinking about how to speak at the moment. He said slowly, &ldquo;maybe there are other ways to burn the fragrant jade book&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yun Yilan snorted, shangguance immediately stopped talking, and the atmosphere seemed a little awkward. But Yun Yilan was obviously in a bad mood at the moment, and did not want to relax at all. He just sat there silently and said nothing.</p>
<p>On Shangguan CE&rsquo;s old face, the wrinkles seem to be deeper in the dark shadow. There is a complicated light in his eyes, but he doesn&rsquo;t know what he is thinking.</p>
<p>After a long time, Yun Yilan suddenly called out, &ldquo;Shangguan junior brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shangguan CE was stunned for a moment and said, &ldquo;what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Others don&rsquo;t understand, but the secret of my burning incense Valley is only you and I who know it best.</p>
<p>Why did the founder set up a sect in the remote place of burning incense Valley in southern Xinjiang? You should know that? &quot;</p>
<p>Shangguan sighed with a trace of vicissitudes in his voice, saying: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s because the ancestor found the xuanhuotan, a relic of ancient southern Xinjiang witch clan, and discovered the strange and powerful secret of witchcraft.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yun Yilan nodded slowly and said, &ldquo;yes, that&rsquo;s why the gate of incense burning Valley took root and sprouted in the remote places of Southern Xinjiang, and opened the door to establish a school, which has continued to this day. All kinds of mysterious witchcraft of the ancient sorcerers, together with the true dharma and Taoism handed down by our ancestors, have given us the status and prestige of the incense valley today. &quot;</p>
<p>Speaking of this, Yun Yilan&rsquo;s voice suddenly took a trace of desolation, saying: &ldquo;but in the past few hundred years, even though the ancestors have exhausted their efforts, we still only have a superficial grasp of the most powerful force&rdquo; Tianhuo &ldquo;among the ancient witch laws in southern Xinjiang.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His expression gradually became angry and said coldly: &ldquo;on that day, when I inherited the position of the valley master, I made a solemn oath in front of the ancestors of all generations that I would discover the secret of the witch family&rsquo;s sky fire, and let us burn incense Valley to dominate the world and lead the clan. However, I never thought that, instead, it is the only key to explore the power of &ldquo;sky fire&rdquo;. The map of the eight evil XuanHuo array handed down by the witch clan has been destroyed. What&rsquo;s more, even the most important XuanHuo Jian has been lost! &quot;</p>
<p>In the dark, shangguance&rsquo;s body suddenly shook.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pa!&rdquo; A crisp sound came from Yun Yi Lan&rsquo;s hand. In his anger, he forced his hand, and it turned out that Sheng Sheng had bent the armrest of the chair down.</p>
<p>On the mountain and river hall, there was silence for a moment.</p>
<p>After a long time, Yun Yilan suddenly sighed and stood up slowly with a bleak tone and said: &ldquo;under the predicament of that day, I occasionally learned from the ancient books of Southern Xinjiang that there was still a battle map in the ancient cave of Zhenmo besides xuanhuotan. Therefore, we had the matter of seeking skin with the tiger. Unfortunately Ah. &quot;</p>
<p>He let out a long sigh, and there was indescribable fatigue on his face.</p>
<p>There was no other sound except for the low sound of insects. Most of the disciples of the burning incense Valley fell asleep peacefully! Who knows, in such a night, there are two old people sitting quietly in the mountain and River Palace?</p>
<p>Cloud Yi Lan seems to be in a very uneasy mood today, the calm of the past is gone. He walked back and forth for many times. Finally, after looking up to the sky and sighing, he laughed bitterly and shook his head. He did not say anything. He walked quietly towards the back hall.</p>
<p>Shangguance sat in the same place and saw that the shadow of Yun Yilan was about to disappear in the dark back hall of the mountain and river hall, but suddenly his eyes flashed, as if in hesitation. After all, I made a choice and a decision and stood up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elder martial brother!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cloud Yi Lan&rsquo;s body pauses for a moment, turns around, light way: &ldquo;what matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shangguance slowly seemed to think carefully about every word and said, &ldquo;after I think about it carefully, there may be hope in this matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yun Yi Lan raised her eyebrows and said, &ldquo;what are you talking about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shangguance seemed to feel a little dry mouthed, and his throat moved. He said slowly: &ldquo;now there are two known places in the world where there are eight fierce XuanHuo arrays. The xuanhuotan and Zhenmo ancient cave have been destroyed. If you want to study the mystery of &ldquo;Tianhuo&rdquo; from this map, I&rsquo;m afraid the future will be dim. &quot;</p>
<p>Cloud Yi Lan hums. &ldquo;Yes, what do you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shangguance was silent for a moment and said: &ldquo;I was thinking that the array is a dead thing. After the road is blocked, maybe. We can start with people. &quot;</p>
<p>Yun Yilan was impatient and said, &ldquo;who will know&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>All of a sudden, his eyes suddenly brightened, his expression turned to dignified, he pondered for a moment, and then slowly said, &ldquo;do you mean that after the collapse of Zhenmo ancient cave, there will still be people left in southern Xinjiang?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shangguance took a deep breath. It seemed that there was a heavy burden on his heart. But after a moment, he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure now. But I guess that after everything in the ancient cave of Zhenmo was gone, one of those non-human and non demon descendants of the witch clan might not be willing to die like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He slowly raised his head in a somewhat bitter tone and said, &ldquo;if what I expected is right, this man may survive. If so, he is the one who knows the most about the mysteries of ancient witchcraft in the world. We may get something from him, and it is not true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yun Yilan was silent, but his face slowly became bright and focused. After a long time, he suddenly nodded and said, &ldquo;yes, younger martial brother, you really have insight. Although there is little hope for this, it is better than despair. In that case, I&rsquo;d like to trouble you to take a trip to the 100000 mountains. I&rsquo;d like to see how xun&rsquo;er and his party are doing. When he went there, he encountered a great change, which was unexpected and difficult for him. &quot;</p>
<p>Shangguance sighed in his heart, stood up and nodded: &ldquo;yes.</p>
<p>&quot;</p>
<p>Yun Yilan took a look at him. Suddenly, a smile appeared on the ground and said, &ldquo;younger martial brother, I was in a bad mood just now. Maybe there is something wrong with the tone of speech. Don&rsquo;t take it seriously.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shangguan shook his head and said, &ldquo;elder martial brother, you can&rsquo;t say anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yun Yi Lan smiles and nods, then turns around and walks into the back hall of the mountain and river hall and disappears in the shadow.</p>
<p>On the huge mountain and river hall, there is only a lonely shadow standing silently.</p>
<p>Darkness crept in and swallowed up his figure.</p>
<p>South Xinjiang, 100000 mountains.</p>
<p>The huge roar between heaven and earth, which made the earth tremble, finally weakened after the crazy eruption of three days and three nights.</p>
<p>Like the scene of doomsday, the fire rain all over the sky did not know when it stopped, but on countless mountains, rivers and the earth, there were burning marks everywhere. When you look far away, it seems that there are still countless fires burning on this miserable land.</p>
<p>However, the dark clouds in the sky, after all, are slowly dispersed, casting a warm and warm glow again, shining on the land.</p>
<p>Although standing in the distance, the air is still more or less filled with that irascible sulfur burning smell, but at this time, from the distant sky blowing down the light wind, more, but is already fresh flavor.</p>
<p>All, after all, is to end.</p>
<p>Everything, as if to start again</p>
<p>The sun and the moon revolve, shuttle ceaselessly; as the stars change, who has seen the vicissitudes of life?</p>
<p>Stars, rising at the beginning of the moon.</p>
<p>The night breeze. There are waves of trees.</p>
<p>Quiet night, quietly came here.</p>
<p>A low, soft chant, such as a sleeping baby, she subconsciously extended her hand. What did you catch?</p>
<p>It is the warm skin, where the stability lies, right beside her, firm and never gone. Her mouth, as if in a dream to get some comfort. There is a faint smile.</p>
<p>In the night, under the starlight, the light wind blows quietly.</p>
<p>Her hair was a little disordered, with a few strands of black hair shaking gently in the night wind and falling on her jade like cheek. She frowned slightly, with a childlike expression of innocence. The beauty in the mess seemed to be more peaceful and slowly seeping into the depths of her soul.</p>
<p>He gazed at the sleeping face in silence. She was by his side, as if she had never been so close.</p>
<p>She fell asleep quietly, breathing the fresh air in the night of Southern Xinjiang. As the wind blew, her chest rose and fell slowly, and her mouth was smiling.</p>
<p>He suddenly raised his head, and the bright moon was moving into the sky, shining soft and warm light on the world.</p>
<p>Moonlight is like water. On them.</p>
<p>Clothes like snow, people like jade!</p>
<p>This is a cliff on the peak of a hundred thousand mountains. It is about a foot out of the mountain, because it is far away from the jiaohei mountain where the Zhenmo ancient cave is located. Therefore, the huge volcanic eruption caused by the collapse of Zhenmo ancient cave did not affect this area. Only some flames falling during the fire rain and a few lava mixed in the crushed stones ignited several fire heads, but all of them soon subsided.</p>
<p>And on the high cliff, you can still see the place after the madness. But there are only countless ashes left.</p>
<p>After they were rescued by xuanhuojian, a psychic deity, with a mysterious fire cover, they both fainted because they were too exhausted. When GUI Li woke up again, they found themselves and Lu Xueqi on the cliff.</p>
<p>After the noise, it was such a calm and cool night.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a light cry came from his side. He turned his head and looked. The beautiful woman in her sleep opened her eyes slowly after a faint smile.</p>
<p>Clear, gentle, reflecting his figure of the eyes ah</p>
<p>All of a sudden, as if the world was still, there was a place in his soul quietly burst!</p>
<p>Then, after deep gaze, she slightly, as if still with a faint sense of shyness, smile.</p>
<p>That smile, like a lily in the dark and at night!</p>
<p>For a long time, but it seems to be a short moment, that time has become meaningless, who cares?</p>
<p>GUI Li also smile, gentle smile, that smile, as if that young man in those years.</p>
<p>She reached out her hand and wanted to hold his hand. However, she found that the hands of the two people had already been held together and had not been separated. A faint blush flashed across her face and slowly sat up.</p>
<p>The clothes slipped down quietly. It was the fierce coat that covered her. She looked at the ghost and said nothing. Just the corner of her mouth, the silent smile seemed thick again.</p>
<p>The night wind is blowing gently, as if a gentle hand swept by the side of the body. In the distance, the trees in the forest on the mountain peak reverberate in the night.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi looked around. Not far away from them, on the edge of the cliff, Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s Tianya sword was thrust upside down in the rock, and the blade with the radius of autumn water stood in the night wind. Beside Tianya, the ghostly Soul Eater was lying on the ground quietly at the moment.</p>
<p>The two magic weapons, at this moment, seem to be so quiet, who knows, what kind of past they have? The faint blue light on the soul swallowing twinkles with the light blue light of Tianya beside it. At this moment, it seems that this pair of magic weapons, which have been entangled for thousands of years, seem to merge and set off.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a low roar came from behind. They turned their heads and looked. Suddenly, a huge figure flashed through the forest. Suddenly, it was the evil beast Taotie who followed the animal God that day. It seemed that it was a bit agitated, but soon, a familiar &ldquo;creak Zhi Zhi Zhi&rdquo; sound appeared, which seemed to comfort it. After a moment, Taotie became quiet and did not make any sound.</p>
<p>They turned their heads and looked at each other.</p>
<p>He hesitated slightly and said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s Taotie. I&rsquo;m here for it. Tomorrow, I should be&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>All of a sudden, he didn&rsquo;t say any more, because at this time, a soft white palm gently covered his mouth.</p>
<p>He was silent for a moment, and his body seemed to tremble a little.</p>
<p>The night wind swept her hair. Her eyes, in such a night, seemed to be a little confused.</p>
<p>However, the smile on the corner of the mouth has never been lost.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi just smiles and stares at him deeply. After a long time, the man who has haunted her dream for countless times, says softly and lowly, &ldquo;forget about tomorrow, OK?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The moon, like ice and snow, falls into the world.</p>
<p>The ghost Li stares at her, looks at her that peerless face and the gentle smile, looks at the persistence and the faint sadness behind the smile, the night breeze is still blowing, her hair is draped on the shoulder, gently flutters, there is a faint fragrance, floating in the wind.</p>
<p>Her figure, at the moment, is so thin, but, such a beautiful, but as if the countless vicissitudes of the world have not been erased.</p>
<p>Forget about tomorrow,</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>Moon, stars.</p>
<p>The night is dark.</p>
<p>He took her hand quietly, in the palm.</p>
<p>Under the endless sky, who cares about the tiny happiness in this world?</p>
<p>Thin body, as if in the night wind gently shaking, palpitating feelings, as if wandering in the years of time for thousands of years.</p>
<p>Is there anyone smiling in the sky?</p>
<p>Is it joy? Is it pain?</p>
<p>No matter what tomorrow is and what tomorrow will be, why care?</p>
<p>Embrace!</p>
<p>Hug you gently, in my arms (to be continued. )</p>
