<p>Three days later, in the morning.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the day, Bai Xiaochun opened his eyes. He took a deep breath and looked very dignified. It was the first time for him to have a competition with other families.</p>
<p>At the beginning, it was no longer a fight with Xu Baocai. At the moment, Xiangyun mountain Xiaobi, who is going to participate, is the real sense of the same door struggle.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun stood up slowly, tidied up the storage bag, and walked out of the house with a look of solemnity. But soon she came back and rummaged under the bed to find out the leather clothes left by the fire kitchen room. She put them on her body layer by layer, and took out the jade pendant and hung it in a position that could be opened immediately.</p>
<p>If it wasn&rsquo;t for the turtle pot to be taken out, he wanted to carry it on his back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a mistake to forget to prepare a big black pot.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun was very regretful and had no time to look for it, so she bit her teeth. Then she turned and walked out of the house again. Looking at the sun in the distance, her eyes showed firmness. She held her head high and walked toward the top of the mountain.</p>
<p>He wears too many leather clothes. Although there is no black pot, he still looks like a zongzi Air tight, so that not long after walking, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s forehead sweating.</p>
<p>No matter how many Khan, he did not take off a leather coat. He was very concerned about Xiao Bi&rsquo;s affairs. He kept imagining scenes of cruelty in his mind. He gradually reached the top of the mountain along the mountain road. However, there was too much fog at the top of the mountain in the early morning. When Bai Xiaochun was walking, he suddenly found that he did not know where he was going.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No way&hellip;&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun quickly asked someone to ask, which changed the direction. She was afraid that she would be late and miss the hour.</p>
<p>At the top of Xiangyun mountain, there is a martial arts arena. This is the place where Xiaobi is held. At the moment, many people are watching and talking in a low voice.</p>
<p>There are even some disciples whose accomplishments are beyond the fifth level of condensate gas. Most of them hold their arms and look at the younger martial brothers and sisters. Of course, there are also those who come to help.</p>
<p>Although not very formal, Xiaobi, a disciple of Xiangyun mountain, is also a place where the disciples of other schools have emerged. There are also more than 20 people participating in this event. Most of them sit cross legged around the martial arts arena, and they are very seriously prepared.</p>
<p>[love to go to the small</p>
<p>There is no third layer of condensate inside. Although the outer door is smaller than that of the regular three, four and five condensate layers, most of them are condensate layer five. Even if it is condensate layer four, only five or six people are involved.</p>
<p>One of them is very conspicuous. She is tall and tall. Under the clothes of the outer disciple, you can see the ups and downs of her figure. If you look at it, you will have unlimited reverie.</p>
<p>The skin is like snow, and the eyes are like water under the willow leaf eyebrow. The appearance is extremely beautiful, especially the Dao pants under the clothes and gowns, which seem to be loose, but they are surprisingly tight at the buttocks and waist, showing the shocking elasticity.</p>
<p>She was surrounded by many other disciples, and she was obviously a admirer of the woman.</p>
<p>This woman is just one of the disciples of the outside school. Although she can&rsquo;t compare with Zhou Xinqi, she is also quite famous Du Lingfei.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This time, elder martial sister Du&rsquo;s cultivation of five layers of condensation gas should be the first one. There is no suspense at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elder martial brother Chen Ziang should not be underestimated. It is said that he made a breakthrough in his cultivation a month ago. Although it is not a great success in the fifth layer of condensate gas, it is also close.&rdquo; When the people of the four weeks were talking in a low voice, not far from Du Lingfei, a proud looking young man stood there. It was Chen Zi&rsquo;ang who was shocked by Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s bamboo and wood at the mission.</p>
<p>When he looked at Du Lingfei, his eyes were also brilliant. He thought that it was impossible for him to be the first one this time, but he had to be the second. Maybe he could take this opportunity to get familiar with Du Lingfei.</p>
<p>Just as the crowd waited, two long rainbow came roaring from the distance. When the moment approached, they turned into the figure of Li Qinghou. There was an old man beside him. The old man was thin and had a slightly dark complexion, but his eyes were very bright. The whole person felt like he was very strict.</p>
<p>As soon as Li Qinghou showed up, all the disciples around him were shocked, so he called on him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See you, Master Sun.&rdquo; One by one, they wonder why they came here in person. We should know that in the past, most of them were presided over by sun Changlao alone.</p>
<p>Du Lingfei, Chen Ziang and others were also surprised and respectfully paid a visit to Li Qinghou.</p>
<p>Li Qinghou nodded mildly. When his eyes swept around the disciples, he wrinkled a little. He didn&rsquo;t see Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>When Li Qinghou frowned, all the disciples around him felt a thump in their hearts. It was Du Lingfei who was also nervous. I didn&rsquo;t know why the palm seat was unhappy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Palmer, are you ready to start?&rdquo; Li Qinghou&rsquo;s elder sun spoke slowly.</p>
<p>Li Qinghou was about to speak, but at this time, there was a figure in the distance, like a small ball, running fast, while still anxious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lost, fog is too heavy&hellip;&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun ran over quickly and saw Li Qinghou at a glance. He spoke quickly. He felt aggrieved. After all, he was not very familiar with the mountain top. Such a big mountain, with such thick fog, he thought about something in his mind and unconsciously took the wrong road.</p>
<p>As soon as he uttered his words, all the other disciples could not help looking at him. Some of them knew Bai Xiaochun, and they all couldn&rsquo;t help laughing. As for those who didn&rsquo;t know him, they frowned one after another, and some even showed contempt in their eyes.</p>
<p>Being able to get lost in Xiangyun mountain can only show that the people in front of us don&rsquo;t come to the top of the mountain every day, and they don&rsquo;t pay attention to the competition of the sect. Most of them are ordinary disciples who stop and wander around the mountain.</p>
<p>Du Lingfei takes a look at Bai Xiaochun and recognizes that Bai Xiaochun is one of the disciples in the clan who are after Zhou Xinqi a few days ago. It is said that she worked very hard to catch the chicken thief. She disdains her heart and takes back her eyes and ignores him directly.</p>
<p>Chen Ziang was in a daze when he saw Bai Xiaochun in the crowd. He subconsciously glanced at Li Qinghou. He remembered that Bai Xiaochun said Li Qinghou was his uncle when he left the task office a few months ago. He immediately understood the reason why Li Qinghou just frowned. He thought that if he met Bai Xiaochun, he could not beat him too hard.</p>
<p>Li Qinghou snorted coldly, glared at Bai Xiaochun fiercely, and nodded to the elder sun beside him.</p>
<p>Elder sun, if thoughtful, also looked at Bai Xiaochun. He laughed and shook his big sleeve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, those who want to participate in the small competition outside, come on stage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seeing Li Qinghou staring at himself, Bai Xiaochun is also aggrieved, but dare not dare to speak. At the moment, hearing elder sun&rsquo;s words, he was the first to rush out and stand on the stage, holding his head high and facing the sea of fire.</p>
<p>Soon everyone came to the stage, including Bai Xiaochun, a total of 20 outer disciples.</p>
<p>The rules of Xiangyun mountain&rsquo;s own Xiaobi are not so strict. As soon as Sun Chang raised his right hand, he took out a cloth bag with a number of small balls in it, each with marks. He asked these disciples to come forward one by one and take them out to decide who to fight.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun didn&rsquo;t come forward first, but was sandwiched in the middle. He went forward and touched out a small ball, which was written 11.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, get out of here. The first, World War I!&rdquo; After elder sun spoke faintly, Bai Xiaochun quickly left the stage with others. Only the disciples who had got one or two balls left the stage. After they looked at each other, their eyes showed sharp light.</p>
<p>Soon they fought directly together, and the sound of bang came out. When they were fighting, Bai Xiaochun looked around. He secretly said that as long as he could win two games, he would be stable in the top five. So he wanted to find the disciples who had got 12 goals, but those people were very strict and did not give him any chance.</p>
<p>Just when she was depressed, the first competition ended and the second began. Du Lingfei, the woman&rsquo;s flag sail, appeared in the middle of the trick, forming fog and besieging the disciple who was fighting with her. After wandering for a long time, the disciple could not get rid of the fog and admit defeat with admiration.</p>
<p>The third and the fourth were soon over. As for the fifth, Chen Zi&rsquo;ang made a clean sweep to defeat the fourth layer of Ning Qi&rsquo;s disciples.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eleven, twelve, play.&rdquo; When elder sun&rsquo;s voice came out, Bai Xiaochun took a deep breath and walked out slowly with a dignified expression. After standing on the stage, he saw a tall and thin young man walking out with a sneer on his face.</p>
<p>The young man&rsquo;s cultivation is not vulgar, but also five layers of condensation gas. His eyes are like electricity, so he looks like he is not easy to be provoked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Younger martial brother, it&rsquo;s bad luck for you to meet me. It&rsquo;s still time to admit defeat now. Otherwise, after fighting, you will pay for the injury.&rdquo; The thin young man spoke in a cold voice.</p>
<p>He was in his words spread out of the moment, Bai Xiaochun here suddenly roared.</p>
<p>The roar was full of air. Many people around the shock were shocked. The thin young man was shocked, and subconsciously stepped back. When he looked at Bai Xiaochun again, he was stunned.</p>
<p>After Bai Xiaochun yelled, a thick blue light suddenly appeared on his blue jade pendant. When he was enveloped around, he felt uneasy. He took out a large number of runes from his storage bag and patted them all on his body. Every time the rune paper fell, there was a flash of light. Soon, there were more than ten lights on his body, which were closely integrated together to form a protective force, Actually, it is more than four feet thick. When you look at it from a distance, it is shocking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s voice came out from the protective light, and the tone was a lot stuffy.</p>
<p>The skinny young man was stunned. Not only was he here, but all the other disciples around him, including all the participants, were stunned. They watched Xiaobi many times, and this was the first time that they saw someone with such protection.</p>
<p>Li Qinghou&rsquo;s face twitched for a moment, but he was helpless in his eyes.</p>
<p>Chen Ziang took a breath. He was more sure that Bai Xiaochun and Li Qinghou were really related. Du Lingfei snorted coldly and despised more in his eyes.</p>
<p>On the martial arts stage, the thin young man bravely shouts and pinches the formula with both hands. He flies out with a wooden sword and goes straight to Bai Xiaochun.</p>
