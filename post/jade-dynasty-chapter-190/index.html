      <p>On Monday, the three men rest here to treat wild dogs. When the wild dogs learned that their lives were picked up, they felt more lucky. In private, they were confused about their unexpected bravery. However, after this time, the relationship between Zhouxian and Xiaohuan has become closer. After all, they have lived and died together. After all, Zhouxian doesn&rsquo;t have the same cold words to him as before. When he is asked to work, he is still the same as before. However, Taoist yegou is seriously injured. More often than not, it is Monday Xian who does more, which makes him old There are complaints.</p>
<p>Xiao Huan and wild dog are still the same as before. However, in front of Xiaohuan, the wild dog Taoist seems to be more afraid and talk to Xiaohuan less. Although Xiaohuan is strange, she doesn&rsquo;t feel that since this period of time, her more spirit has been attracted to the seemingly plain black cover book.</p>
<p>The wild dog Taoist priest had never read Xiaohuan before. He was rather surprised, but Xiaohuan never said the origin of the book, and Monday immortal was not clear about it. As time went on, he gradually got used to it, but occasionally he felt that Xiaohuan&rsquo;s expression gradually changed, but he could not tell what was different from the previous one.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>The monster catastrophe rose from the 100000 mountains in southern Xinjiang, and the first one to suffer was the land of Southern Xinjiang.</p>
<p>The people of all ethnic groups here are far more seriously poisoned by animal demons than in the middle land. Ten rooms and nine empty rooms, which is almost the inevitable outcome of many villages and towns, that is, no one survived the whole village Shanzhai, but also appeared from time to time.</p>
<p>After the Holocaust, there are more small number of animal demons left here in southern Xinjiang than in the middle land. People who survive in the disaster often suffer from the rampage of those remaining demons. This life is really dark and hot.</p>
<p>It was in this situation that Gui Li set foot on the land of Southern Xinjiang again.</p>
<p>Along the way, he didn&rsquo;t find any trace of animal God, but there were countless people from the right path flocking to him. Among them, there are many famous figures such as Qingyun and Huoxiang. Many of these people are like crazy, looking for the whereabouts of the beast God, but it is obvious that many people have been looking for it. No one found him.</p>
<p>After Qingyun was defeated in the first battle, the beast God who was seriously injured and fled seemed to have disappeared out of thin air, and no one could find him again. However, the 100000 mountains in southern Xinjiang are always his former residence. Will he come back anyway?</p>
<p>With that in mind.</p>
<p>GUI Li entered the southern Xinjiang. With him, there are countless disciples of the right path. Among them, the foe incense Valley is a return to his hometown. After all, the burning incense Valley is in southern Xinjiang, but the purpose of other orthodox disciples is not just to help the people in southern Xinjiang to eliminate the small number of animal demons.</p>
<p>However, no matter what, because of the arrival of these people, the original unscrupulous remaining demons have been temporarily restrained. After all, these righteous disciples will also take measures to remove these monsters as far as they can. In this way. The atmosphere in southern Xinjiang was very popular.</p>
<p>However, no matter who it is, no one has found the shadow of the beast God in the southern Xinjiang. Now the only possibility is that among the hundred thousand mountains, which are poor mountains and evil waters, and mysterious.</p>
<p>There are many secrets hidden in the Black Mountains!</p>
<p>Before entering the mountain, GUI Li went to qilidong of Miao Nationality in southern Xinjiang. For nothing else, just for what the great wizard did for Biyao that day, he would come to offer a memorial ceremony.</p>
<p>Tianshui village, qilidong, this way. The original bustling scene was gone, and the road was miserable. Even his heart, which he thought had already been rigid, could not help but be moved.</p>
<p>For what. Will there be such a calamity of poisoning the world?</p>
<p>He has made great achievements in his own practice and stayed out of this great wave of evil. But what about the countless suffering people in the world? What mistakes did they make and why did they have to bear such a disaster?</p>
<p>Back to Tianyin temple, countless people pray to the gods and Buddhas day and night, looking at the world. More and more people are doing this, worshiping the gods. But who helped them when the disaster came?</p>
<p>So, is this worship still useful?</p>
<p>Or is it really the answer to the mysterious sentence throughout the book of heaven</p>
<p>Heaven and earth are not benevolent, taking all things as cud dogs?</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>When he stepped into the qilidong, he took a breath of cool air. The place which was once beautiful and beautiful in his impression had already been destroyed. Almost all the houses that had been gathered together were only ruins. There were no more people in the street, let alone children running and playing.</p>
<p>The remnant people can only see 12 / 10 of them. Most of them are in front of the dilapidated houses. They try to find something to use from the ruins. However, what they can find is the remains of the dead.</p>
<p>There was a sad and decadent atmosphere in the whole qilidong. Occasionally, several children stood there, their eyes full of confusion and fear. In a short time, adults would come out from behind and pull them in again.</p>
<p>He walked slowly along the street, and soon attracted the attention of some Miao people. In his eyes, there was a strong sense of vigilance. In the strange atmosphere, even the small ash on the shoulder seems to be a lot more honest, although it still looks around.</p>
<p>GUI Li sighed to himself. He didn&rsquo;t want to see more, so he quickened his pace and went straight to the altar on the hillside of qilidong. The more we went inside, the more obvious the surrounding houses and roads were, the more dilapidated they were. It seemed that when the catastrophe came on that day, many Miao soldiers fought against the evil beasts and demons in order to protect the holy land!</p>
<p>Even in the air, it seems that there is a faint smell of blood.</p>
<p>At the foot of the mountain, two young Miao soldiers stopped him. GUI Li stopped in silence and looked at them. The two men, armed with spears and covered with armor, were only 15-6-year-old boys. Even their armor looked bigger than their bodies. I wonder if they were left by the brave soldiers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many grunts?&rdquo; A man asked in Miao language.</p>
<p>GUI Li didn&rsquo;t understand, but he didn&rsquo;t speak when he guessed what he would ask. He just raised his head and motioned to the waist of the mountain. He didn&rsquo;t use his fingers because he still remembered that the Miao people regarded this behavior as disrespectful.</p>
<p>The two teenagers were stunned for a moment, and then one of them seemed to be a little longer and shook his head. Neither of them got out of the way. GUI li felt a little anxious in his heart, but he was actually unwilling to fight with the great wizard people who had helped him. Moreover, he could not do so when he saw the tragic scene in the Seven Mile cave.</p>
<p>He was silent for a long time. When the hostility in the eyes of the two teenagers became more and more serious, he sighed and turned around to leave.</p>
<p>It was only when he took a few steps that there was a commotion in the mountain. He turned his head and looked. A moment later, a man ran down the mountainside. At first, he said a few words to the two teenagers in Miao language. The two teenagers nodded and stood aside. Then, the man who looked like a priest about 40 or so said to the ghost in some poor Chinese language</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, the great wizard and the great wizard will ask you to go up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li was surprised and frowned: &ldquo;the great wizard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man nodded repeatedly. He took a deep breath, nodded and followed the man up the hillside.</p>
<p>The cave is still in its original place, but the building and stone platform of the cave are all changed beyond recognition. The rocks are broken and the ground is rolling. Among the rocks, there was a young Miao man, only about 30 years old, dressed in a great wizard&rsquo;s robe. Smile and watch the ghost come.</p>
<p>His eyes were dim and bright, as if his own fire of passion was burning in it, which was quite different from those Miao people at the foot of the mountain.</p>
<p>He walked up to him. With a smile, the young man opened his mouth and said in very fluent Chinese: &ldquo;Hello, Mr. GUI Li. I&rsquo;m a new generation Wizard of Miao Nationality in southern Xinjiang. I&rsquo;ve heard a lot about you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was stunned for a moment and nodded back. Before he could speak, the young wizard had already said with a smile: &ldquo;please come in. I&rsquo;ll take you to see the new wizard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he led the way into the still dark cave. Ghouli followed him and slowly melted into the darkness.</p>
<p>It was still the same dark in the cave. The figure of the young wizard swayed slightly in front of him. Somehow, GUI li felt that he was familiar. After careful reflection, he remembered that when he came here last time, the great wizard once called out the young man, but he had taken over the position of the great wizard in a short time.</p>
<p>Like the last time, the young wizard came to the house where the God of dogs was worshipped in the deep cave. The huge fire was still burning and crackling, but the old and withered figure was no longer seen.</p>
<p>The young man stepped forward and saluted the statue of the God of the dog. From the mouth of the dog god statue, the young man took out a wooden box and placed it on the ground respectfully. Then he said to the ghost: &ldquo;it is our custom of Miao people that after the death of the great wizard of all ages, we have to sacrifice under the God of the dog for a year. This is the ashes of his old man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Looking at the small wooden box, the whole box was plain and without any decoration. Even the wood used was the most common tree in southern Xinjiang. The great wizard, like countless Miao people, was quietly sleeping here.</p>
<p>He bent his body and bowed deeply.</p>
<p>With a squeak, the monkey jumped from him and ran to one side.</p>
<p>According to the custom of the Middle Earth, the young wizard bowed down and saluted him. Then he held up the wooden box and put it into the mouth of the God of dogs again.</p>
<p>The two men sat on the ground beside the fire. The fire reflected in their eyes and was very bright in the dark.</p>
<p>Without waiting for the ghost to ask, the young man already said faintly: &ldquo;I was his old man&rsquo;s disciple in his lifetime, and after the terrible disaster, all the senior priests here died, so I inherited the position of the great wizard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He nodded his head in silence and looked at the God of the dog in the distance. He said slowly, &ldquo;the great wizard is also dead for me. Every time I think about it, I feel uneasy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young wizard leaned back slightly and said, &ldquo;you are wrong, master. He told me that his life has come. Even if he doesn&rsquo;t go to the Central Plains, there is only one way to die. But it is the great fortune of all Miao people that your sect can send back the ashes of master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ghost Li sighed and said in a low voice: &ldquo;these things are done by other people who have the intention to do them. They have nothing to do with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young wizard laughed, and obviously didn&rsquo;t care about the fierce words. He said, &ldquo;but this time you come to qilidong, I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li said: &ldquo;in fact, it&rsquo;s nothing else. I just came here to pay homage to the great wizard. What&rsquo;s more, the disaster is so severe that I intend to pursue the animal God, the chief culprit. Do you have any clues? &quot;</p>
<p>The young wizard&rsquo;s face changed slightly. Obviously, for him, the word &ldquo;beast God&rdquo; is still a very terrible and taboo word. He soon fell silent. After a long time, he said faintly: &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t have to care. Countless people in the world want to look for him, but they can&rsquo;t find him. It&rsquo;s normal that you don&rsquo;t know. If I disturb you here, I&rsquo;ll leave first. &quot;</p>
<p>Then he wanted to get up. The young wizard hesitated, and suddenly said, &ldquo;are you going to trace the beast God?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a young wizard</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure,&rdquo; he said</p>
<p>The young wizard pondered for a moment and said, &ldquo;in that case, I will tell you what I know. I don&rsquo;t know how to find the animal God, but there is an old legend in my family that the animal God is a devil like ghost. He can&rsquo;t be killed. He can only be suppressed and sealed like a witch lady ten thousand years ago.</p>
<p>In order to suppress him, we need to take five artifacts from his body. Those five artifact are the source of the life of the beast demon. If it is lost, the beast demon will fall into a deep sleep. In addition, there is another important point. When the beast demon was rampant that day, the Demon power was strong and invincible. Thanks to the witch maiden, she trapped it with the magic array &ldquo;eight fierce XuanHuo array&rdquo; passed down by the witch clan. If you can find this kind of array, maybe &quot;</p>
<p>He nodded slowly.</p>
<p>The young wizard thought for a while and then said, &ldquo;how to find the monster is really beyond my imagination. However, according to the legend of the clan, when the witch maiden town was granted the animal demon, it was in the depths of 100000 mountains, a place called the ancient cave of demons. Moreover, it is said that the empress herself turned into a stone statue, facing the deep of the ancient cave, perhaps. If you find a place like this, there will be traces of monsters. &quot;</p>
<p>In his heart, he nodded to the young wizard and said, &ldquo;thank you very much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The great wizard smiles and says nothing.</p>
<p>When they walked out of the cave, they asked him why there was no sadness in his eyes.</p>
<p>The young wizard stopped for a moment and said faintly, &ldquo;if I am decadent and sad again, what should I do with those people in qilidong? It&rsquo;s not that I&rsquo;m not sad, it&rsquo;s that I can&rsquo;t be sad! &quot;</p>
<p>After listening, he remained silent for a long time, and then left.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>After leaving qilidong, GUI Li didn&rsquo;t rush on. He walked slowly along the way. He thought over and over what the young wizard had said several times. The strange &ldquo;eight fierce XuanHuo array&rdquo; made him think of another person Xiaobai involuntarily.</p>
<p>On that day, she left angrily, and there was no news from then on. Although she didn&rsquo;t have to worry about anything more with her Taoism and magic power, she mostly wanted to find the &ldquo;eight fierce XuanHuo array&rdquo;, and she felt a little guilty.</p>
<p>Blood sucking pearl Demon power has puzzled him for many years, but a while ago, under the wordless jade wall of Tianyin temple in Xumishan mountain, he realized the four volumes of the book of heaven. He integrated the power of blood sucking demon with the three true dharmas of Buddhism, Taoism and demons, and even the power of XuanHuo to judge the pure Yang. For him, with the improvement of his cultivation, the power of blood sucking pearl demon is no longer a major obstacle to the relationship between nature and life 。</p>
<p>But, somehow, with the Epiphany under the wordless jade wall, he gradually thought of a lot of things, and the unexpected things in the past were also gradually seen in the recollection.</p>
<p>Is it not because of the relationship between Biyao and herself that Xiaobai treats him so?</p>
<p>She was single, and returned to the southern Xinjiang to search for the Dharma array at the height of the beast demon disaster that day. The heaven and the earth were dim, and now there was no news of her. When I think of this place, I can&rsquo;t help but feel a pain in my heart, but I don&rsquo;t know how to find it.</p>
<p>GUI Li pondered for a long time. Finally, he decided to go to the burning incense Valley in secret, not for other reasons. First, he listened to Xiaobai zengdao, and the eight evil XuanHuo array had appeared in the XuanHuo altar of the burning incense valley. In this case, Xiaobai would go here if he wanted to find this array. Even if she was not there, it would be good for him to go and have a look.</p>
<p>A decision, the ghost will go to the burning incense valley.</p>
<p>Incense valley was originally one of the three great sects of justice in the world. However, he was the first to bear the brunt of the catastrophe. It happened to be at the exit of the beast demon, and the end could be imagined. Fortunately, Yun Yilan, the master of the burning incense Valley, led his disciples to Zhongtu and joined hands with the green cloud gate to deal with the beast demons. Although the burning incense valley was destroyed in a mess, the disciples of the burning incense Valley didn&rsquo;t hurt their muscles and bones.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that the great school of justice has come to such a bad end that it&rsquo;s hard to see. Moreover, after the catastrophe, many rumors and rumors have been spread, which means that all the people in the burning incense valley are timid and afraid of doing things, and they are respected by the righteous school. He did not dare to face the beast demon disaster alone, but hid behind the Qingyun gate.</p>
<p>Nowadays, Qingyun gate and daoxuan immortal are really supreme in the heart of the world&rsquo;s righteous way, and their reputation is very high. There are too many people like burning incense valley. As a large number of righteous disciples have entered Southern Xinjiang to search for the whereabouts of the beast God, the disciples of the burning incense valley will not fall behind others. However, when they meet on weekdays, the disciples of the burning incense valley have lost their arrogance.</p>
<p>However, despite all this, the incense Valley is a famous school, and its strength is still there. Although there are a lot of rumors, no one dares to humiliate it in person. As for the burning incense valley itself, the valley is really in a mess, at least when it sneaks in. This is what we see.</p>
<p>A valley which was originally quiet and beautiful is full of bad smell of scorching and fishy smell. Countless disciples of burning incense Valley carry all kinds of rotten garbage and bones in the valley, including human and animal remains.</p>
<p>After thinking for a moment, he realized that he had sneaked into the burning incense Valley at night and was still found in the burning incense valley.</p>
<p>Not all the disciples in the burning incense valley have profound Taoism, but many strange animals that they are good at keeping in captivity, which is beyond defense.</p>
<p>But Yun Yilan can take most of his disciples to Zhongtu, but he can&rsquo;t take these animals with him. And when the catastrophe comes, those ferocious monster frenzy passes through here, these many animals are inevitable. As time goes by, the corpse is rotten, and the smell is more difficult.</p>
<p>But at the moment, without these strange animals, it is also good for ghosts. At least he was not afraid of any monsters emerging from the corners and dark corners of these rooms to call the police and expose him.</p>
<p>There are many disciples in the burning incense Valley, but half of them are sent out to track the whereabouts of the beast demons. How can the burning incense Valley not want to do what countless orthodox sects want to do. Most of the remaining half of the disciples do the work of tidying up the garbage and ruins in the valley. Even if there are some elders in the valley, people like Yun Yilan and shangguance can&rsquo;t patrol the valley all the time. With little difficulty, GUI Li sneaked into the incense valley.</p>
<p>At this moment, the evening of genius is much brighter than that of the last time he came to the burning incense valley. However, it is much easier to sneak in.</p>
<p>After he sneaked into the burning incense Valley, he didn&rsquo;t think much about it. He went straight to the xuanhuotan, the important place of the burning incense valley. Xiaobai was imprisoned here on that day. The eight evil XuanHuo array was also arranged here. Naturally, he came here to look for it. It&rsquo;s just that this place is the forbidden area of the burning incense valley after all. In such a busy situation, the guard defense of xuanhuotan seems to be a little more strict than that when the ghost came last time. I don&rsquo;t know whether it is because Xiaobai escaped and outsiders sneaked in.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that Gui Li&rsquo;s practice at this time is not the same as that of the past. Although the burning incense Valley is closely guarded in the dark fire altar, the ghost Li lurks carefully and carefully, and finally steals into the magnificent XuanHuo altar.</p>
<p>As he expected, although the guards were tight outside, there was no one to guard the XuanHuo altar. At a glance, it seemed as if it was the same as when he came last time. There is still that strange dark red formation on the ground, which is deeply engraved on the ground. It is the mysterious eight evil XuanHuo array in the legend.</p>
<p>However, on that day, when Guili and Xiaobai escaped, the magma eruption caused by them could be seen.</p>
<p>On the surrounding walls, you can see the burnt black places splashed by the magma, and the places where the stones collapsed are countless. It is the eight evil XuanHuo array diagram on the ground. In some places, you can see that it was slightly deformed by the blazing fire.</p>
<p>However, if it was an ordinary place, it would have been destroyed in such a disaster, and the surrounding land boundary would still be in good condition. It seems that the array played a strange role and it was preserved.</p>
<p>Looking up, we can see that the second and third layers of Xiaobai&rsquo;s original confinement have lost their effectiveness, and they are opened like that, revealing the empty and dark hole. In the whole majestic xuanhuotan, under the slight light of fire, there is only one person&rsquo;s figure, flickering gently.</p>
<p>He was silent for a long time. He shook his head and went to the eight evil XuanHuo array. After a careful look, all the evil spirits in the huge array are still as clear and vivid as those in the memory. The patterns connecting these evil spirits are also weird and complex. He took a deep breath and sat down in front of the picture.</p>
<p>Just as he was about to meditate on the mysterious sorcerer array in the legend, suddenly, in the silent and gloomy altar of dark fire, in the darkness above him, came the clear and resounding laughter of a woman.</p>
<p>He stood up and looked up. He blurted out and said, &ldquo;is that you, Xiaobai?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His voice suddenly stopped, and a figure floated down from the dark shadow above. His once familiar yellow clothes and bright and soft eyes seemed to be intoxicated with beauty at a glance——</p>
<p>Surprisingly, he was the man he had never dreamed of. The woman who had died in the catastrophe in the rumor &ndash; the Golden Vase son!</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>After the initial consternation, the ghost quickly calmed down. Jin Ping&rsquo;er was still standing there, as if nothing had changed. Her clothes, face and expression, even the corners of her mouth, still had that faint and charming smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; she said with a smile</p>
<p>GUI Li looked at her in silence. After a long time, he said, &ldquo;how can you be here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Golden Vase son gently swept the hair on the temples with her hand. In her small action, she seemed to have infinite amorous feelings. She said in a soft voice, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m waiting for you here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grimly frowned and said, &ldquo;wait for me? Do what? How do you know I&rsquo;ll be here? &quot;</p>
<p>Jinpinger said with a smile: &ldquo;you have forgotten that the last time you came here, you came with me. It is said that this time you want to track down the beast God. According to the legend here in southern Xinjiang, you have to seal the animal God. Naturally, this array is inevitable. Where else can you go if you don&rsquo;t get here? &quot;</p>
<p>She slightly narrowed her eyes, as if some small complacency, but also unspeakable as the general charming water, smile: &ldquo;you see, I am smart?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost frowned and felt that he was still a little turbulent under the temptation of the Golden Vase after he had made great progress in his way. After the Holocaust, the legendary dead woman seems to have improved her skills.</p>
<p>Since she is not dead, what about the other people, the masters of other evil sects who were destroyed in the catastrophe? Don&rsquo;t they die?</p>
<p>GUI Li&rsquo;s heart was startled and uncertain, but he still said coldly: &ldquo;you haven&rsquo;t answered me yet. What are you waiting for me to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Golden Vase son smiles gently, but the light tone says the soul stirring words: &ldquo;I know the location of the ancient cave where the beast God is sealed. After the ghost King Lord knows, he will let me help you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost suddenly raised his head and looked at the Golden Vase, but he could see that his eyes were like water and his smile was like a flower. (to be continued. )</p>
