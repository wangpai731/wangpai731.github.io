      <p>Bai Xiaochun was frightened all the way. He ran down the mountain or even out of the zongmen. He wandered around for a long time in the city outside the Zongshan gate of Lingxi.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What to do.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun has a sad face. He is deeply aggrieved. When he thinks of it, it is clear that the bird came by himself and took the pill. But now he can&rsquo;t explain it clearly, and elder Zhou is unreasonable</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I seem to be First? &quot; When Bai Xiaochun was worried, he suddenly thought of something and was stunned for a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, as my younger brother, I didn&rsquo;t want to compete with those younger generation.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun coughed and felt a little complacent at the bottom of his heart. However, he thought that the first word was that he needed to fight against Tianjiao on the north bank, so he was depressed again.</p>
<p>After wandering around the city for a long time, until late at night, Bai Xiaochun pondered that she could not but go back, so she took out the jade slips and sent a letter to Xu Baocai.</p>
<p>Let Xu Baocai go to his yard to see if elder Zhou is blocked there.</p>
<p>After a long time, when he saw the sound of the jade slips sent back by Xu Baocai, he felt a little relieved. He went back to the Mountain Gate carefully and quickly went up Xiangyun mountain. From a distance, he saw only Xu Baocai outside the yard. After careful observation for a long time, he quickly approached.</p>
<p>As soon as Xu Baocai saw Bai Xiaochun, he immediately showed excitement in his eyes. He was about to speak and was pulled into the yard by Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle Bai, don&rsquo;t worry. Elder Zhou was called away by the headmaster at that time&hellip;&rdquo; Xu Baocai opens his mouth in a hurry. He looks at Bai Xiaochun and is crazy in his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When he was in the fire kitchen, he kept a secret and even came up with the idea of selling the number of disciples of the outer gate. Behind the inner door, he was even smaller than the first, causing a small stir. The most amazing thing was that he came back alive, glorifying the identity of the disciples and the dignity of the headmaster and younger martial brother. Now he is the first one in the qualification war He must be a man in the future</p>
<p>Xu Baocai saw with his own eyes the whole process of Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s surpassing everyone and becoming the number one, which has shocked most of the day. In his heart, he has regarded Bai Xiaochun as an amazing person, especially recalling the scenes of past events. He has more and more respect for Bai Xiaochun, and immediately clasped his fist and deeply worshipped him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Congratulations to Uncle Bai, who became the first person in the qualification war on the South Bank of China!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun looked around in the yard. She felt relieved. She looked up at the direction of the old cave around the top of the mountain. She swore to herself that when she got to the foundation, she would stew and eat the bird that had framed her!</p>
<p>At the moment, hearing Xu Baocai&rsquo;s words, Bai Xiaochun turns her head and looks at Xu Baocai and gives a dry cough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This seat is a person who is indifferent to fame and wealth, like white clouds in the sky. I didn&rsquo;t want to compete with those younger generation for this false name. However, it was not the right time for Zhou Zhanglao to appear here.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun light mouth, put out a pair of senior master&rsquo;s appearance, seems to be feeling.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s the usual, Bai Xiaochun says so. Although Xu Baocai doesn&rsquo;t dare to show any expression on the surface, he must despise him at the bottom of his heart. But now, Bai Xiaochun is already the Tianjiao in his eyes, so he speaks quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle Bai has always kept a low profile, but even if you are so arrogant, even if you are so low-key, you will be able to wave your hand inadvertently, and you will shine with attention!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s heart was full of enthusiasm, but he was still reserved on the surface. However, he was reluctant to let Baocai say more words in his heart. So when he looked at Xu Baocai, he looked appreciative and encouraged.</p>
<p>Xu Baocai felt Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s encouragement and spoke more excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This time, uncle Bai, on behalf of our south bank and the north bank, will surely sweep away the weakness of our south bank for many years, and will certainly shock the north bank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The five Tianjiao on the north bank are said to be the strongest under the foundation. They are ferocious and arrogant. This time let them understand that the real Tianjiao is on the South Bank of our country, in Xiangyun mountain!&rdquo; Xu Baocai was excited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five Tianjiao?&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun looks as usual, but his heart jumps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, there are five Tianjiao on the north bank. Among them, the north of sunset peak is cold and arrogant. He practices sunset, one of the Ten Secrets of Lingxi sect. There is also a rare nocturnal beast. It is ferocious and ferocious, with infinite power. He has killed several enemies with nine layers of condensation gas directly! It&rsquo;s called the first person outside the sunset peak! &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A living man?&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s eyes widened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing. There&rsquo;s another person, Xu Song of the dome peak. He was born with the ability to communicate with God. When he came to the mountain gate, he was taken as a disciple by the leader of the dome peak at a high price. The control of the fierce beasts has reached a pure and terrifying state. It is said that he can control five fierce beasts at the same time. There was a Ning Qi San Xiu that provoked him. He chased him for three months and finally controlled the five Beast, devour each other alive for three days, and only bones are left in the end</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only bones left?&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun was shocked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are more ferocious than him. The third and fourth Tianjiao are brothers and sisters, both from iris peak. The female&rsquo;s name is Gongsun Waner. She is very beautiful and good at raptors. She once made a war with Zhou Xinqi. I don&rsquo;t know who will win or who will lose!</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s name is gongsunyun. He is good at the way of insects and poisonous insects. He likes to wear black robes and raise spirit insects by himself. It is said that his body is full of insect eggs, which is extremely strange. Those who fight against him often end up crawling all over the body, burrowing into the body and swallowing the flesh and blood. If the reaction is slow, he will be completely devoured, and there will be no bones left! &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No bones left?&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun took a breath. After imagining the picture in her mind, she only felt numb on her scalp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The last one It is said that he is the most mysterious one among the five Tianjiao on the north bank. He is unknown. He was brought back by the head seat of guiya peak 20 years ago. His life experience is mysterious and his name is guiya. He comes from guiya peak and is good at ghost way. He has practiced the top ten secret methods of Lingxi sect. It is said that the most difficult one to practice is as famous as shuize country Ghost night! It is said that he has reached the level of a hundred ghosts. Some people say that he is the first day proud on the north bank&hellip; &quot; Xu Baocai told Bai Xiaochun what he knew. Bai Xiaochun was shocked by the news.</p>
<p>He found that Tianjiao on the north bank seems to be much more vicious than the south bank. Although the north bank mainly controls animals and inevitably contacts with blood, the gap is too large.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our south bank has been dominated by the north bank for many years. Every time we fought Tianjiao battle, we failed. Even last time, we heard that the top ten li nine were on the north bank. This is a disgrace to us&hellip;&rdquo; Xu Baocai was talking excitedly. He suddenly found that Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s face was not right. He was stunned for a moment and looked at Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle Bai, what&rsquo;s the matter with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun quickly raised her chin and spoke solemnly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a member of the south bank, I was furious to hear that I was so on the south bank!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle Bai doesn&rsquo;t have to be angry. This time when he comes forward, he will let the north bank know that my south bank is very powerful.&rdquo; Xu Baocai clenched his fist and said excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the north bank? I&rsquo;ll let them go in smoke and ashes with a wave of my hand.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun was carried up, some can not, at the moment, strong, raised chin, small sleeve a swing, proud open mouth.</p>
<p>Xu Baocai was excited and said a few more words. Finally, he left with enthusiasm. (add it here. It will be deleted at the end of the chapter. Recently, in microblog and public wechat, many readers said that they left messages for me on XX website and XX artifact to urge me to change the watch. Can I see it or not? I can&rsquo;t see it. Please leave a message. This is the only genuine one. I can see your message here</p>
<p>At this moment, Bai Xiaochun is alone in the yard at night. He recalls the five people Xu Baocai mentioned before. When the mountain wind blows, he feels chilly behind his back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kind of people are there on the north bank? Animal, insect, ghost It sounds terrible&hellip; &quot; Bai Xiaochun took a breath. When he returned to the wooden house, Xu Baocai&rsquo;s introduction to the north bank was still in his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must have been intentional The more she thought about it, the more she felt something was wrong. Finally, she completely understood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In my whole life, the most tiresome thing is to fight and kill people who are more powerful than me!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun made up his mind that he would not go to the battle of Tianjiao this time.</p>
<p>But the next morning, before Bai Xiaochun could figure out any way not to participate in the battle of Tianjiao, a decree passed down from Xiangyun mountain into a black light and flew into Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s wooden house. Suddenly, the sound of Li Qinghou was heard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bai Xiaochun, the first one in the qualification war on the south bank, joined the other nine members in the battle of Tianjiao on the outer gate of both sides of the north and the South after half a month! If you don&rsquo;t, you will be thrown into the valley of ten thousand snakes</p>
<p>&ldquo;Again&hellip;&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun, with a sad face, listens to the voice of Li Qinghou in the decree. He feels that he has been trapped by the perimeter</p>
<p>As Li Qinghou&rsquo;s voice in the decree dissipated, the light flashed, and the jade slips disappeared. A bracelet appeared out of thin air and fell in front of Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun is stunned. After picking up the bracelet, he looks at it carefully. His spiritual power melts in. At once, the bracelet turns into black liquid, covering Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s right hand in an instant. Under the spread, it spreads all over the body.</p>
<p>At the same time, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s ear also heard the manipulation method left by Li Qinghou, and pointed out that the bracelet can resist the friars in the early stage of foundation construction, and give full play to it!</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s whole body was shocked. He was not a newcomer at the moment. He clearly knew the value of such a protective object. It was even more precious than the God crane shield given by the leader. He could not help but look up at Xiangyun mountain top.</p>
<p>Although Li Qinghou didn&rsquo;t describe it too much, Bai Xiaochun felt a deep warmth on the bracelet. He thought of Xiao Bi and Li Qinghou&rsquo;s expectation.</p>
<p>Silence for a long time, white small pure a bite teeth, eyes have firm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I took part in the battle of pride</p>
<p>。</p>
