      <p>As time went by, Bai Xiaochun was shut up in his residence and could not get out of the house. Ten days later, when the solemn bell echoed the whole clan gate, waves came from his jade slips.</p>
<p>The Tianjiao battle between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait was officially held on the 10th day after the qualification competition!</p>
<p>Every half of Jiazi&rsquo;s outer gate Tianjiao battle is carried out on Zhongdao mountain. On this day, when the bell of Zhongdao mountain reverberates throughout the Lingxi sect, countless disciples of the outer gate all gallop towards Zhongdao mountain.</p>
<p>On weekdays, there is little communication between the north and the south. Only the inner disciples can enter each other&rsquo;s area, while the outer disciples do not have the qualification. Only on this day, zhongdaoshan will be open to all the disciples of the sect, so that the outer disciples can enter and watch the Tianjiao battle. At the moment, both the south bank and the north bank are excited, and the flying figures can be seen everywhere in Lingxi.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This time, we must wash away our shame on the south bank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let the north bank know that our south bank will surpass the past and step into glory!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When all the outer disciples on the south bank were excited, the outer disciples of the four mountains on the north bank all galloped to Zhongdao mountain. On the way, proud voices rose and fell one after another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The weakness on the south bank has been losing to us for thousands of years in a row, and this time will not be an exception.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The north bank will win and the south bank will lose. Lingxizong is the leader of our north bank, and the south bank is just a vassal!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the uproar between the two sides of the Strait became more and more intense, at the moment when Qi Qi, the numerous disciples of the outside school, rushed to Zhongdao mountain. On Qingfeng mountain, Shangguan Tianyou looked indifferent and flew out with a trace of sharp light in his eyes.</p>
<p>At the same time, LV Tianlei, on the purple tripod mountain, raised his head and let out a low roar. His whole body was shining with thunder, and he galloped away in the cheers of countless disciples around him.</p>
<p>Zhou Xinqi also flies out at this moment. The three Tianjiao on the south bank are extremely dignified at the moment.</p>
<p>It was at this moment that Bai Xiaochun raised his head in the residence. There was blood in his eyes. He took a deep breath, and his face was filled with awe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s time If a strong man goes to war, he will have his robe! &quot; He stood up slowly, raised his right hand to the storage bag, and suddenly seven or eight leather clothes appeared. In the first battle of the Luochen family, his leather clothes had been broken. These were prepared again in recent years, with better quality and more tenacity.</p>
<p>At the moment, he looked serious. After putting these leather clothes on his body, he swung his sleeves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If a strong man goes to war, he must have his back armor.&rdquo; As Bai Xiaochun waved his sleeve, a big pot flew out of the storage bag. Zhang&rsquo;s pot was destroyed in the first World War of the Chen family. This new pot was prepared by Bai Xiaochun after returning to the ancestral gate. Now, with a dignified eye, he carried the big black pot on his back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If a strong man goes to war, there must be a magic weapon!&rdquo; When Bai Xiaochun spoke to himself with pride, he waved again, and immediately the small wooden sword flew out. He tied it to his belt. The golden and black sword flew out and hung on one side. There were three flying swords hanging on his body. Then he took out the God crane shield and put it in the most convenient position.</p>
<p>Still feel uneasy, put on the bracelet that Li Qinghou gave him, then raised his chin, his whole body showed a solemn and stirring meaning, and walked out of the door of the wooden house with heavy steps.</p>
<p>Standing in front of the door, he listened to the bell ringing in his ears. He was about to move on. Suddenly, he felt that there was something wrong. He patted the storage bag, took out a long gun and held it in his hand.</p>
<p>Facing the wind, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s small sleeve swung out of the yard.</p>
<p>Looking from a distance, Bai Xiaochun was bulging like a ball, with a cauldron on his back and a long gun in his hand. When he walked, he shook and collided with five or six flying swords, making a jingling sound, especially his hair was waving in the wind.</p>
<p>In the past, countless disciples of Xiangyun mountain were shocked by Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s appearance.</p>
<p>The sound of the bell was incessant and gradually spread. It became more and more intense. It reverberated throughout the Lingxi sect, arousing the hearts of countless outer disciples, and also making many inner disciples fly to zhongdaoshan.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun took a big stride, and a large number of outside disciples gathered behind him, and Xu Baocai was also in it, constantly sending out cheers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle Bai&rsquo;s momentum is like a rainbow, magnificent and magnificent!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Win, win!&rdquo; These people are all good at Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s outside disciples. At the moment, they are all behind Bai Xiaochun and fully support her. Among them are Hou Xiaomei, whose voice is sharp and obvious.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun looked back at the people behind him. He was very moved. He nodded to them. He felt that everyone liked himself so much that he must fight for his voice this time</p>
<p>So he raised his chin and marched forward bravely. Step by step, he came to zhongdaoshan. When he got here, he saw a huge battle platform.</p>
<p>The battle platform is surrounded by array light, which covers the whole battle platform. In the distance, there is a high and protruding tower from the top of Zhongdao mountain. There are many elders of the sect. They are coming.</p>
<p>On both sides of the battle platform below, there are many disciples coming from outside. They gather together in a dense and dense way. The number of both sides is no less than tens of thousands.</p>
<p>On the north side of the battle platform, there are all disciples from the north bank. One by one, they are obviously stronger than those from the south bank. In particular, everyone is following a fierce beast.</p>
<p>The fierce beasts were different in appearance, but almost every one showed their ferocious eyes. It was not easy to offend them at a glance, especially the seven or eight people in front of them, male and female, each with a cold look and powerful momentum.</p>
<p>Among them, there are two people most conspicuous. One is a woman with beautiful appearance. She is wearing a long purple skirt. Beside her, there is a colorful Phoenix bird. The bird seems to be more noble than her circumference. Her eyes are like electricity. When looking at everyone, it seems that they are looking down.</p>
<p>The other is a young man. He is wearing a blue robe, his hair is flying, and his appearance is extraordinary. Especially, there is a red sun mark on his forehead.</p>
<p>At his feet, there was a huge beast lying on his feet. At a distance, he looked like a big dog with thick black hair and sharp claws, especially the golden light in his eyes.</p>
<p>The animal&rsquo;s teeth are exposed, and it looks extremely fierce. However, the huge body, lying on its stomach, is one person high. If you stand up, you may be afraid that it is two people tall. It gives people a strong feeling. You can imagine the physical strength of the big dog, which must be appalling.</p>
<p>It is beihanlie, one of the five Tianjiao on the north bank, who bears the mark of the sun. The big dog beside him is also the famous one on the north bank Nocturnal beast!</p>
<p>In addition to these two people on the north bank, the other disciples standing in front of them are also very amazing. There is another one who is wearing a black robe and even covers his face, showing only cold brown eyes. If you look carefully, you can even see that his eyes are filled with insects and insects!</p>
<p>This scene, let the disciples of the south bank have been shocked.</p>
<p>At the moment, all the disciples on the north bank, with scorn, look across the platform to the south of the platform South bank disciple!</p>
<p>&ldquo;The south bank still failed this time. The only people who could see it were Shangguan Tianyou, LV Tianlei and Zhou Xinqi.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s said that another person from Nan&rsquo;an has won the first place in the qualification war. This person is said to be Yao Rong&rsquo;s disciple and the leader&rsquo;s younger brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No matter who it is, it&rsquo;s useless. My north shore is destined to be the strongest!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the discussion of the disciples on the north bank, at the south of the battle platform, almost all the outer disciples are present. Obviously, compared with the disciples on the north bank, they are not as many as they are.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A group of savages who raise fierce beasts, this time we must be ashamed of ourselves on the south bank!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a shame to lose to them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In front of the disciples of the outer gate of the south bank stood nine people, Shangguan Tianyou, Zhou Xinqi and LV Tianlei. Among them, there were six others. All of them looked solemn, as if they were killing each other. They and Tianjiao in front of the north bank were fighting each other with their eyes.</p>
<p>When it seems that the killing is too close, Bai Xiaochun comes.</p>
<p>Almost at the moment of Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s arrival, not only Shangguan Tianyou and others looked at him, but all the disciples from the outer gate of the south bank all looked at him. All kinds of thoughts were in his eyes, and there was much less discussion among them.</p>
<p>The heart is not pure, the heart is full of cold.</p>
<p>Lu Tianlei is also unconvinced. He stares at Bai Xiaochun fiercely. The whole body of lightning makes a crackling sound.</p>
<p>Zhou Xinqi is silent. When she looks at Bai Xiaochun, her eyes show a strange light. She seems to be looking carefully to see what kind of power is hidden in her little white body.</p>
<p>Even on the other side of the north bank, people can&rsquo;t help looking at Bai Xiaochun. For them, Bai Xiaochun is strange. After being shocked by Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s dress up, they show contempt one after another.</p>
<p>Especially those on the north bank, the disdain in the eyes is more.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun felt embarrassed when she found herself so noticed. She coughed, held her head high, held a long gun, straightened her body, and walked to the front of the crowd, standing beside Zhou Xinqi.</p>
<p>After perceiving that both sides were fighting with their eyes, Bai Xiaochun immediately became spirited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eye war, I&rsquo;m good at it!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s spirit was shaken. He looked at the disciples on the north bank from the battle platform with a serious expression.</p>
<p>At the moment, the wind blows, blowing away white Xiaochun&rsquo;s hair, but his figure with the long gun in his hand, momentum can not help but set off a lot.</p>
<p>With the passage of time, the crowd on both sides has been constantly increasing, and soon there will be a sea of people, with the battle platform as the center, in groups.</p>
<p>And Tianjiao in front of the north bank gradually arrived. The last one appeared was a young man in a black robe. He looked ordinary, but his face was pale, as if there was no blood. He came alone, stood in front of him and closed his eyes, as if he had no interest in everything. But all around him appeared at the same time Twisted, as if hidden countless fierce ghosts, is ferocious to rush out of the hell, to the world.</p>
<p>At this time, a long rainbow whistling from the north and south, straight to this place, is the palm seat of the seven mountains and elders, now most of them appear, straight to the terrace on the battle platform.</p>
<p>Elder Zhou was also among them. The Phoenix bird, who slandered Bai Xiaochun, also circled around. When he saw Bai Xiaochun, his eyes showed the meaning of holding their toes high.</p>
<p>The figure of the leader Zheng Yuandong also appeared on the terrace. After all the people arrived, his eyes swept over the disciples on both sides of the north and south below, and suddenly opened his mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The battle for the qualification of the outer gate on both sides of the north and the South was won in a round on the north coast. All 12 qualified people could fight the battle of Tianjiao.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was a round of failure on the south bank, and only ten people participated in the war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are 22 people in total. They will draw lots to decide their opponents. They will choose the top ten disciples from other schools and choose The strongest and first outside disciple</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t deliberately kill people when they are fighting with each other. The recovery time of three sticks of incense in each round, and after one party admits defeat, the other party can&rsquo;t continue to fight. This contest will be presided over by Ouyang, the law enforcement hall</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have to behave well. The four elders of Lingxi sect will also pay attention to this war Now, the battle of Tianjiao in the outer gate of North and South Start</p>
<hr>
<p>In recent years, I have been writing books, rarely watching movies and TV and listening to songs. You should know my house. I have devoted all my energy to novels. I really didn&rsquo;t think that I casually named a supporting role, which would cause so many attacks. It&rsquo;s really aggrieved. In fact, novels are novels. People and things are fictional. Please don&rsquo;t put them into reality. Otherwise, a book needs hundreds of thousands of characters In the future, I don&rsquo;t know how to name it. Ah, after the explanation, if there is any harm, please forgive me. This is a fairy story in another world! This time I compromise once, Xu Song, I will change to Xu Song, but only this time!</p>
