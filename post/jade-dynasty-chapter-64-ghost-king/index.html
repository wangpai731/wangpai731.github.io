      <p>Not to mention Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s sudden sight of Baguio, he was shocked. A group of people from the demon sect, who were just loud, immediately calmed down when they saw Baguio coming out. They seemed to be very afraid of Baguio. Even the wild dog Taoist who looks like he is not afraid of the earth has no voice at the moment.</p>
<p>For a moment, no one dared to speak to her. But after a while, someone coughed twice, and then said slowly, &ldquo;miss Biyao, I have a few words, don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;s proper? &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan looked around, but he saw that the speaker was the strange young man standing with the elder brother and others. At the moment, looking at the eldest brother and other people&rsquo;s faces, they are also surprised. It seems that this young man will suddenly speak.</p>
<p>The old man frowned and whispered to the young man, &ldquo;Xiaozhou, where can you talk? &quot;</p>
<p>Biyao looked at the young man, but he didn&rsquo;t seem to know him. He said to the old road, &ldquo;who is he? &quot;</p>
<p>The old Dalian quickly smiled and said, &ldquo;he is the new recruit of our blood refining hall, surnamed Zhou Mingcai. &quot;</p>
<p>Bagao snorted and said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s OK, you let him say. &quot;</p>
<p>The young man named Xiao Zhou did not have stage fright, but came out calmly and said, &ldquo;miss Biyao, everyone here knows that milk is the only beloved daughter of the ghost king, so everyone respects milk. And the ghost king called me to look for Kui Niu. It&rsquo;s our duty. Just - &ldquo;he paused, with a gentle smile on his face, but his words were gradually cold.&rdquo; but now Kui Niu can&rsquo;t find it, but there are more and more people in the right way. It&rsquo;s said that even the seven heads of Qingyun gate have come to two, and we are not enemies. In this case, the ghost King sect still let us work here, but we didn&rsquo;t explain it. For fear of some religious friends, we would ask, is it possible that the ghost King sect wants to use the right hand to get rid of us? &quot;</p>
<p>Everyone was in a uproar. There are several people around Biyao. It is Huodi to stand up. It seems that most of them are the people of the ghost King sect in the demon sect. Except for the few people of the ghost King sect, the rest of the people in the demon sect were surprised at first. However, no one criticized the young man. Instead, they looked at the green Yao&rsquo;s place. Their faces were alert, and the low voices around them were rising one after another.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan can&rsquo;t help worrying about Biyao.</p>
<p>At the same time, I thought to myself, how does this young man surnamed Zhou talk like this? He is from the demon sect, and there are many sects. Is it possible that the ghost King clan would</p>
<p>He was just thinking about it, when he heard the coldly saying of Baguio in the field, &ldquo;who are you? Dare to stir up a quarrel! &quot;</p>
<p>Xiao Zhou smiled, but he was not afraid of this beautiful woman in high position, and said lightly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just a nobody. Because I admire the saints, I joined in. Compared with Miss Biyao&rsquo;s milk, it is quite different. But now the righteous people are waiting for us. They want to kill us and then hurry. The ghost King sect is one of the four major sects in our religion. At this time and here, our leaders even ignore us in danger. I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s impossible to say that? &quot;</p>
<p>At this time, even Zhang Xiaofan felt it. Although he spoke peacefully, every sentence was aimed at the ghost King clan. The meaning of provocation was no longer obvious, but I don&rsquo;t know what his intention was. But see old man and so on surprised look. But it&rsquo;s not like I was instructed by the blood refining hall.</p>
<p>At this time, the other people of the demon sect were more excited, and their voices grew louder. In the face of the ghost King sect and others, their faces gradually showed hostility. Biyao frowned slightly, took a step back, turned around and whispered a few words to the person behind her.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan looks far away. Only the torch burns, but not very bright. There was a tall man beside Baguio. Behind the tall man, there seemed to be a middle-aged man standing. However, he was standing in a dark place and was blocked by the tall man in front of him. He could not see his face clearly.</p>
<p>Biyao said a few words to the man, turned around, took a step and looked around coldly.</p>
<p>Her beautiful appearance is like frost and snow, and there is a kind of bleak and desolate beauty in the yellow light of the burning torch.</p>
<p>The sound around her dropped rapidly, and everyone&rsquo;s eyes fell on her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All of you -&rdquo; her voice echoed in the cave: &ldquo;the ghost King clan, like all of you, is a saint disciple, and also believes in the virgin of Youming and the king of Tiansha. You can rest assured that no matter how powerful the ghost King clan is, it dare not do such things against the doctrines. &quot;</p>
<p>As soon as this statement was made, the faces of most of the demons on the scene were relaxed. The old man took a long breath and hurriedly stepped forward to hold Zhou and whispered, &ldquo;have you said enough? &quot;</p>
<p>Xiao Zhou turned to the old man and laughed. Suddenly, he said in a loud voice, &ldquo;in that case, we can rest assured.</p>
<p>However, miss Biyao, please explain Kui Niu&rsquo;s story to me. If you can&rsquo;t find Kui Niu, you can let me leave earlier. Otherwise, the ghost King sect didn&rsquo;t mean to hurt us, but we are going to die in the right hands! &quot;</p>
<p>Biyao and other people of the ghost King clan stared at Xiaozhou almost at the same time, but they didn&rsquo;t know how much trouble they had caused, so they still smiled and stood there. However, nearly ten people of the demon cult around him shouted at the same time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right! &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Please give Miss Biyao a message! &quot;</p>
<p>「┅┅」</p>
<p>When the surrounding voice became quieter, Bagao took back her eyes from her childhood. She knew that it was not the time to worry. She said, &ldquo;you guys, even if he doesn&rsquo;t say it, we, the ghost King clan, will explain it to you. In fact, I went to Liubo mountain in the East China Sea to</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bang long&rdquo;</p>
<p>The whole huge cave suddenly seemed to shake. Zhang Xiaofan and Tian linger were in the deep cave, almost one of them was staggering, and the people of the demon sect were even more surprised. At that time, someone called out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter? &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there an earthquake? &quot;</p>
<p>But soon they got the answer. They only heard the roar of the wind outside the cave, like thunder. A strong voice came in through the long cave, &ldquo;demon sect thief, come out and die! &quot;</p>
<p>Everyone looked at each other, but Zhang Xiaofan and Tian linger looked at each other with a happy face. When they heard it, they recognized that it was the voice of Taoist Cangsong, the first Taoist of Longshou peak.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan really admired that there was a long distance from the outside of the cave to here. Taoist Cangsong&rsquo;s voice was so clear that he didn&rsquo;t say anything, and even shook the surrounding rock walls to slightly resonate. This magic practice is really quite different, and far inferior to himself.</p>
<p>People in the demon sect look at each other. It was not long before someone said, &ldquo;how can those who are righteous find this place so secret? &quot;</p>
<p>At this moment, Xiao Zhou suddenly said in a loud voice, &ldquo;miss Biyao, this is a critical moment. You Taoist friends heard the ghost King&rsquo;s sect summon you to Liubo mountain. But I didn&rsquo;t expect to encounter such a big risk. What should I do? &quot;</p>
<p>As soon as they heard this, they all said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s reasonable. Miss Biyao, please speak quickly! &quot;</p>
<p>Baguio breathed deeply, and the sharp sound outside the cave could not stop. I&rsquo;m afraid that just the right people get the news and come here one after another.</p>
<p>Biyao&rsquo;s face was gloomy. He stepped forward and said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where we are, you Taoist friends. But now, as the only daughter of the ghost king, I am also trapped here. I am in danger with you. Do you have any doubt about the ghost King clan? &quot;</p>
<p>As soon as the words came out, most people were quiet. At this time, the tall man standing beside Biyao. Take a step forward and say in a deep voice, &ldquo;you guys, it&rsquo;s a critical moment. Why don&rsquo;t we all work together to fight against the strong enemy? If we kill them together, we will not necessarily lose out to those righteous hypocrites outside! &quot;</p>
<p>Everyone nodded. In fact, at this moment, there is no other way. Although the cave is large. But it&rsquo;s a dead road, and there is no other exit. Now, all the demons are in order, roaring bravely. Swarmed out.</p>
<p>Not long ago, there was a clash of magic weapons and a roar of curses. But in the originally crowded cave, there were only Biyao of the ghost King clan and the man standing in the shadow who could not see clearly.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was happy at the same time, but at the same time he worried about Biyao involuntarily, even though he knew that she was a demon. He is not the same person as himself, but he has experienced life and death several times along the way, which really makes him feel different to some unruly women.</p>
<p>Biyao frowned tightly, and was about to turn back to talk with the man in the shadow. Suddenly, she glanced at the corner of her eyes, but saw that she was still standing alone. She didn&rsquo;t go to fight with the others. It was Xiaozhou, and she didn&rsquo;t know when he stayed.</p>
<p>This week, many times, she provoked people to be hostile to the ghost King clan. What did Biyao like about him? Her face sank immediately and she sneered, &ldquo;what do you want to do if you don&rsquo;t help the Taoist friends and stay here? &quot;</p>
<p>Xiao Zhou&rsquo;s face was still gentle, and he could not see the panic of the soldiers in the right way. He smiled and said, &ldquo;I want to see if the people of the ghost King sect really advance and retreat with our powerless little soldiers, or just treat us as cannon fodder? &quot;</p>
<p>When Biyao&rsquo;s face was cold, she was about to refute. Suddenly, she heard the man standing in the shadow behind her saying, &ldquo;you are not a member of our holy sect. What&rsquo;s your status? &quot;</p>
<p>Biyao was shocked, but the man named Xiao Zhou was also shocked. He looked at the shadow, and his eyes were alert. He said in a deep voice, &ldquo;who is this? How can you talk so nonsense? I am a disciple of the first generation of the blood refining Hall of the holy religion. Will you insult me just because I speak with justice? &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan and Tian linger were also surprised. Unexpectedly, things have changed so much. But Zhang Xiaofan was more confused. He was the one who couldn&rsquo;t see clearly. His voice sounded familiar, but he didn&rsquo;t know where to hear it.</p>
<p>Only the man standing in the shadow said lightly, &ldquo;the blood refining hall was the leader&rsquo;s holy religion eight hundred years ago, and it can&rsquo;t live forever, but it has already declined. How can you be accepted as an ordinary disciple if you are not as old as you? If he had this ability, the blood refining hall would have turned over. &quot;</p>
<p>Xiao Zhou snorted and said, &ldquo;how do you know how deep I am when you haven&rsquo;t seen me do it? &quot;</p>
<p>The man seemed to smile and said, &ldquo;why do you need to see you practice? Just now, the old Cangsong road used Taiji Xuanqing road to force the sound into the stone and shake the mountains. It was intended to build up the power of the mountain. If the road was a little poor, the soul would be shaken. If the old man was not stable, you would feel as if nothing had happened. If the road was higher, you would know why it was so difficult? &quot;</p>
<p>Xiao Zhou&rsquo;s face was discolored. He looked at the man in the shadow for a long time and said, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine that there are hidden dragons and crouching tigers in the demon sect. Who is your excellency? &quot;</p>
<p>With a slight rebuke, Biyao said angrily, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s die! &quot;</p>
<p>Suddenly, in the originally dark cave, white light flashed, fragrance bursts, and white flowers in front of Biyao&rsquo;s body danced, like frost like snow, circling endlessly. But no matter how bright the white light is, it seems that it can&rsquo;t shine into the man&rsquo;s shadow, and people still can&rsquo;t see his face clearly.</p>
<p>Xiao Zhou dare not neglect, step back.</p>
<p>Reaching for the sky and catching it, he heard the sound of &ldquo;hiss&rdquo;&hellip; He came out of the sky, and Sheng Sheng grabbed a bright fairy sword. The most striking thing is. There are seven bright stars carved on the sword body which is as bright as autumn water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh? &ldquo;Suddenly the man in the shadow whispered,&rdquo; seven star sword! &quot;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too late. At that time, Biyao has been fighting with Xiaozhou. Two people fly to the sky, only to see the flowers to sword, this huge space, by his two people such a fight, it seems a lot smaller.</p>
<p>As Zhang Xiaofan listened, he realized that most of Xiao Zhou was the right person. He was worried about him in his heart. But when he saw the duel between the two, he always looked at Biyao. He has real contradictions in his mind. I only hope that the two will come to an end soon, and that Biyao will soon run away.</p>
<p>But at the moment Tian ling&rsquo;er was beside him, but suddenly he whispered, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that Xiao Zhou is mostly our disciple of Qingyun sect. &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was shocked and said, &ldquo;why, does milk know him? &quot;</p>
<p>Tian ling&rsquo;er shook his head, looked into the field, and said softly, &ldquo;I remember that my mother said that the seven star sword is a famous sword that connects the heaven and the mountain in changmen. It was used by martial uncle daoxuan. Later I heard it was passed on to him. &quot;</p>
<p>Voice did not fall, suddenly only listen to the site of the green Yao Jiao drink, sad flowers scattered and open, the wind roared in an instant. The whole cave is full of dazzling white flowers, like a sharp wall of light, which is pushed by the sea.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan has seen Biyao perform this magic several times. He knows that its power cannot be underestimated. He is worried about that Xiaozhou.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, Xiao Zhou frowned and stepped back in the air. It&rsquo;s like holding a thousand Juns with the right hand and the right wrist with the left hand. It&rsquo;s like imitating wild grass. The fingers are screaming in the air. In a twinkling of an eye, a Taiji picture is drawn in front of you.</p>
<p>When Zhang Xiaofan and Tian linger look at it, there is no doubt that Xiao Zhou is indeed a disciple of Qingyun sect. Just now, they know it is the Taiji Xuanqing Dao of Qingyun sect!</p>
<p>In an instant, the seven star sword turned upside down and stood in the middle of the Tai Chi diagram. The &ldquo;clank and Clank&rdquo; vibrated and rattled. A moment later, the seven star sword flew out. Around the blade, there was a flash and flow of Tai Chi light wheel. It was so powerful that it was unstoppable.</p>
<p>Not long ago, I saw these two magic weapons collide in the middle of the sky!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boom&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the place where the sound was loud, the halo burst out from the collision of two magic weapons rushed out rapidly. The whole cave roared, and the upper rock wall couldn&rsquo;t bear the impact of the huge force. The stones and stones fell one after another.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan and Tian linger also felt that their surroundings were shaking, they were almost unstable, and they were even more surprised. This week&rsquo;s practice on Taiji Xuanqing road was just a little better than all the younger generation of Qingyun sect disciples he had seen.</p>
<p>The white flower wall light of Baguio in the field faded and disappeared, but she was pale and obviously suffered a small loss. Zhang Xiaofan and she also get along for a period of time, the heart is called bad, expect she will not give up. Sure enough, I saw that the blue Yao flashed by, the sad flower flashed back, but her hand stretched out to her waist, holding the crisp, beautiful and golden little bell.</p>
<p>Xiao Zhou frowned and was alert. At present, the woman is young, but she is beyond his expectation. Just now, he used 90% of his magic power to defeat her, but it seems that she has stronger magic power. But what he feared most was still the man standing in the shadow in silence. He was really unpredictable, which was a serious problem.</p>
<p>Just listening to the sound of the clear bell, &ldquo;jingle Dang&rdquo; rang up, but in this murderous cave, it was very incongruous. Baguio stood in the air, her hands flicked, and a small golden bell slowly floated in front of her, ringing.</p>
<p>Seeing from Zhang Xiaofan, I saw the beautiful woman in the middle of the sky, her hands were soft and boneless, and she danced gently. The golden bell was between her hands, and slowly began to rotate, making a clear sound from time to time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ding Dong&rdquo;, &ldquo;Ding Dong&rdquo;, &ldquo;Ding Dong&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Zhou suddenly felt that he had lost his mind, forgetting that he was in the critical moment of life and death. If not for the firm heart of Tao these years, he would have lost his mind. This little bell seems to have the power to draw people&rsquo;s hearts.</p>
<p>Only in this moment of hesitation, his mind was again filled with boredom, and he could not help being shocked. He dared not listen to it again and shouted, &ldquo;the devil died! &quot;</p>
<p>The sound of the big drink shakes the walls and forces the &ldquo;jingle&rdquo; down for a moment. The seven star sword is like electricity, like light, thundering!</p>
<p>Biyao&rsquo;s face is slightly white. It seems that she has some difficulty. But when the seven star sword was shot quickly, it didn&rsquo;t retreat a little. The jade finger in the right hand picked it up and bounced outward. The joyous bell went forward and collided with the seven star sword in the middle of the sky with a tink.</p>
<p>When Xiao Zhou&rsquo;s body shook, he felt that the evil sound was like piercing his ears and corroding his bones. He came from the seven star sword in the air. In a moment, his whole body was shaking.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan and Tian linger were shocked. They were about to go out for rescue. Suddenly, Xiao Zhou&rsquo;s face suddenly calmed down. He had a big drink. The seven star sword was shining again. It was a counter attack. On the contrary, Biyao&rsquo;s face is very pale, and her eyes are dull. It seems that she suddenly lost her mind and couldn&rsquo;t stop her. She will die under the seven star sword.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s heart was shaken. For a moment, there was a blank in his mind. No matter how many, he jumped out and lost his voice. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His voice did not fall, but there was a shadow in the air, and the purple air flashed back.</p>
<p>With a bang, Xiao Zhou was hit back and fell to the ground. The red blood flowed from the corners of his mouth, and the seven star sword flew out. With a bang, he was thrust into the hard rock wall by julisheng.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan and Tian linger lose their color and jump to Xiaozhou. Tian ling&rsquo;er was about to drive amber and Zhu Ling away. Unexpectedly, Xiao Zhou forced him to deal with severe pain. He grabbed the two of them and hissed, &ldquo;no, no, younger martial brother Zhang, younger martial sister Tian, that man and that man are too high in their ways. You are not his opponents! &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was shocked. Tian linger beside him could not help asking, &ldquo;how do you know the names of the two of us? &quot;</p>
<p>Xiaozhou wants to talk and stops. Looking forward, they feel something. They turn their heads together and look at Biyao.</p>
<p>In the middle of the air, a middle-aged man with his back to Zhang Xiaofan and other people helped Biyao fall down together. He said in a peaceful way, &ldquo;Yao&rsquo;er, this joyous bell is a artifact left by Mrs. Jinling. It&rsquo;s not good enough for milk. It&rsquo;s easy to backfire. You can&rsquo;t use it lightly in the future! &quot;</p>
<p>At this time, Biyao&rsquo;s face gradually returned to normal and whispered, &ldquo;yes, Dad. &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan and other three were stunned for a moment. Xiao Zhou looked better at the moment, stared at the back of the man and said in a deep voice, &ldquo;are you the ghost king of one of the four great masters of the demon sect today? &quot;</p>
<p>The middle-aged man smiled lightly, turned around, Zhang Xiaofan and others also saw his face. But he has a fine eyebrow and square face. His eyes are elegant, which is different from those in the evil cult just now. But Zhang Xiaofan was even more surprised and said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s you? &quot;</p>
<p>The ghost king with the appearance of a middle-aged scribe was the one who told him the secret of the burning staff - ten thousand people to go to the tea stall at the foot of kongsang mountain that day. (to be continued. )</p>
