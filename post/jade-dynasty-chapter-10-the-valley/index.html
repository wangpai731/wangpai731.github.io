      <p>Zhang Xiaofan came up to the mountain and came to the familiar bamboo forest, but he saw the mountains full of verdant mountains, cascading layers, mountain breezes passing by, the bamboo sea undulating, like the waves of the sea, extremely magnificent, and his heart suddenly widened.</p>
<p>He took a deep breath of fresh air in the mountains, moved around, and walked into the bamboo forest with a hatchet. The place he went to at this time was different from when he came three years ago. It was in the deepest part of the bamboo forest, where large bamboos stood and the bamboo was harder.</p>
<p>In the morning, a faint mist wafted through the forest, like a gauze, and the green bamboo leaves on both sides of the trail were crystal clear with dewdrops.</p>
<p>After walking for a while, I was exposed to the green sea. The black bamboos here were mostly towering, with lush foliage, straight into the sky, and the light penetrated through the gap between the branches and leaves, leaving a shadow on the ground. Zhang Xiaofan looked left and right, picked a large black knot bamboo, compared with a picture, then raised his knife to cut.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poof&rdquo; Suddenly there was a muffled noise. Zhang Xiaofan only felt a pain in his forehead, but was hit by his forehead with something. He looked down, and a pine cone rolled on the ground. There are black knot bamboos at the front and left, and there are many bamboo shoots, but pine cones are definitely not.</p>
<p>He thought for a moment, a smile appeared on the corner of his mouth, and looked around, shouting, &ldquo;Sister, are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His voice spread far away in the bamboo forest, but no one answered for a while. Zhang Xiaofan knew that Sister Sister had always been naughty and teasing, and was about to shout again. Suddenly, there was a pain in his forehead. The pain was so severe that he was thrown into a pine cone again, and there was a &ldquo;squeak&rdquo; above his head. Screams.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan looked up with pain and saw that on this black bamboo, I don’t know when to crawl a gray-haired monkey, holding a few pine cones in his hand, and his tail was hanging on the bamboo branch, &ldquo;squeaky&rdquo; laughed sharply It&rsquo;s a great fortune to be happy.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan stayed for a while. He has never seen a monkey in a bamboo forest in the past three years, and there are almost all bamboo forests on the peak of the bamboo. Only there is a wild cypress forest in the deep valley of the mountain shade. It seems that this monkey lives there. Somehow today Will run up the mountain.</p>
<p>Dazhufeng is tall and steep, although there is no Tongtianfeng higher than Yuntian, but also straight into the sea of ​​clouds, climbing from the foot of the mountain, there is little way to do it, and most of the disciples in Qingyunmen are coming and going. Zhang Xiaofan Xiu is superficial. In addition to cutting bamboo every day, he has also listened to his brothers talking about it. The pine and cypress trees in the deep valley of the mountain behind the Dazhu Mountain are forested. At that time, the ancestor of Dazhufeng&rsquo;s ancestors also had some swords to visit the deep valley, but there was only the virgin forest, there was no strange thing, but there were more beasts and poisonous beasts, but they never came out of the valley, so they have been peaceful for these years. thing.</p>
<p>He was thinking, suddenly saw the monkey&rsquo;s hand raised, he jumped in his heart, quickly removed, and really a pine cone fell down, if not dodge, you will suffer.</p>
<p>The gray monkey saw him flashing away, screaming twice, his face angry, but seemed to blame Zhang Xiaofan for not being able to dodge.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan made a grimace at the monkey, ignored it, and walked away, thinking that the monkey was actually delighted by smashing people, but it was rare, really ignorant beast. He walked two steps, and suddenly heard the wind sound behind his ears, unable to dodge, &ldquo;Poo&rdquo;, the back of the head was hit by a hard pine cone, this force is not light, Zhang Xiaofan only felt that his eyes were black, could not help but called .</p>
<p>I saw the monkey clapping hands on the bamboo branches and laughing, dangling, very happy. Zhang Xiaofan was furious, rushed to shake the bamboo, and a large black bamboo was shaken by him, but the gray monkey only wrapped his tail around the bamboo trunk, and let him swing around, not afraid, but instead &ldquo;Squeak&rdquo; keeps laughing.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan saw that he couldn&rsquo;t help the monkey. He was even more annoyed and pulled out a hatchet to cut the bamboo. The monkey was not afraid, and only looked at him with interest on the bamboo.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s head was covered with sweat, and finally he scored seven or eight points. Seeing the success was imminent, he suddenly heard a scream from the bamboo, looked up, and saw that the gray monkey&rsquo;s tail swayed, his body flew up, and actually jumped to the side On another black bamboo, then with a &ldquo;snap&rdquo;, another pine cone was thrown down.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was furious, and no matter whether the monkey could understand it or not, he pointed at it and shouted, &ldquo;You will come down if you have a species.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gray monkey scratched his head and tilted his head for a long time. It is estimated that he still didn&rsquo;t understand what there was or didn&rsquo;t. He just laughed and grimaced at Zhang Xiaofan.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was half angry with it, but he was helpless. On this day, he barely finished his homework, but his head was hit by the monkey seven or eight times, and the pain was endless.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was full of anger, hated going down the mountain, and ignored the monkey. Unexpectedly, the monkey was addicted to play. He had been waiting in the bamboo forest for several days in the morning. Once Zhang Xiaofan came to cut the bamboo, he took pleasure in smashing him. Looking at Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s annoyance, he was very happy.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Before dinner that day, Tian Linger pulled Zhang Xiaofan aside and secretly asked, &ldquo;Xiaofan, what&rsquo;s wrong with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan has been bullied by the gray monkey for several days, and his head was smashed blue and purple, and the pain was endless, but he humiliated himself by a monkey, and no one said it. At this time, listening to the sister asked, hesitated for a moment. And finally told her.</p>
<p>Tian Linger&rsquo;s red lips flattened, he couldn&rsquo;t help laughing, and two small dimples appeared beside his face. Zhang Xiaofan seemed to be teased by her, but it seemed like something else. His face was inexplicably hot, and he looked down.</p>
<p>Tian Ling&rsquo;er patted Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s shoulder generously, and said, &ldquo;Relax, younger brother, these Tianniang asked me to study in Tai Chi Cave more than two years later. You have been bullied by a monkey. Don&rsquo;t worry, I will accompany you up the mountain tomorrow and teach you the bad monkey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She has an old-fashioned tone, but it&rsquo;s a bit like coaxing a child, but Zhang Xiaofan has been used to it since childhood and doesn&rsquo;t care if he smiles bitterly.</p>
<p>In the early morning of the next day, Tian Linger really got up early and went up the mountain with Zhang Xiaofan.</p>
<p>The cool breeze in the mountains, blowing slowly, Tian Ling&rsquo;er was wearing a red dress, just like the first time she and Zhang Xiaofan went up the mountain to cut bamboo, then jumped ahead and walked. Zhang Xiaofan followed behind, looking at the beautiful girl in front, like a red cloud, fluttering gently among the mountains. With the mountain breeze, there seemed to be a faint fragrance.</p>
<p>There was a trance in his heart, and suddenly there was a feeling of how good it would be to walk down forever.</p>
<p>He was just thinking of God, but Tian Ling&rsquo;er had gone too far. He looked back and shouted, &ldquo;Xiaofan, why are you so slow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan awakened, his face red, and he dared not think about it any more, quickly hurried to catch up.</p>
<p>Before the two of them came to the bamboo forest, Tian Linger said to Zhang Xiaofan: &ldquo;Xiaofan, you go in first, and I follow behind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan nodded, walked in with a hatchet, and walked a few steps. Suddenly remembering to tell Tian Linger to be careful, he turned and looked, but she was gone.</p>
<p>He stayed there for a while, feeling inexplicable for a while, then shook his head, throwing away those boring thoughts, and walked deep into the bamboo forest. At the destination, there was silence in the forest. Zhang Xiaofan looked around and couldn&rsquo;t find the gray-haired monkey. He whispered in his heart: But don&rsquo;t the monkey be spiritual, but he didn&rsquo;t dare to come when he found a helper today.</p>
<p>He thought to himself and looked around, but he couldn&rsquo;t find the trace of the monkey. It was also in vain. He had to walk to a black bamboo and cut it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Squeak&rdquo;, suddenly, a familiar scream sounded above his head.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan jumped away conditioned reflex immediately, but felt a pain in the top of his head, but it was too late, and was hit by a pine cone, so it was painless. Zhang Xiaofan looked up and saw that the gray monkey hung upside down on the bamboo branch as usual, and kept smiling.</p>
<p>There was a rejoicing in his heart, and he jumped up and pointed at the monkey and laughed: &ldquo;Haha, you are finally here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His voice didn&rsquo;t sound, but the monkey was frightened by him. I thought that this man was always violently thundering and angry when he was smashed on weekdays. How could he be so happy today, was it because of me being smashed for a few days, he became addicted, If you don’t smash it, you will feel uncomfortable.</p>
<p>At this moment, the red shadow suddenly flashed between the bamboo forests, and Tian Ling&rsquo;er stepped on the &ldquo;Amber Zhu Ling&rdquo;, coming from the air, like lightning, with five fingers forming claws, and grabbed the monkey.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the monkey was extremely clever. When he looked at the corner of his eye, he immediately reacted. The tail wrapped around the bamboo branch was released immediately, and the whole body fell off. Tian Ling&rsquo;er figured out the direction of his escape from the front, back, left, and right, but he didn&rsquo;t expect the gray monkey to fall. He couldn&rsquo;t help but stunned and grabbed an empty space.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was moving in the underground, but he saw the monkey gently relaxing his arms in the air, grabbing the bamboo trunk, and immediately attached it, and then stayed without hesitation, seeming to know that the woman in red above was powerful, immediately swaying and beating, from One bamboo shook to another bamboo and then to the next bamboo, intending to escape.</p>
<p>Tian Ling&rsquo;er was upset and shouted in the air: &ldquo;Chasing!&rdquo; With a left-handed lead, Amber Zhu Ling broke away, Zhang Xiaofan ran away in the ground and ran away.</p>
<p>If it is on the open ground, with the speed of amber and Zhu Ling, Tian Ling&rsquo;er has caught the gray monkey for a moment, but now in the dense bamboo forest, it is a big hindrance. The gray monkey is extremely clever and never runs away in a straight line, swinging left and right in the forest, bending back and forth and running forward. Tian Ling&rsquo;er must pay attention to the monkey trails, but also has to watch out for the ubiquitous black knot bamboo, which is very troublesome. As for Zhang Xiaofan, he has no choice but to chase and hurry on the ground.</p>
<p>The two men and one monkey chased in such a hurry. In the squeak of the gray monkey&rsquo;s &ldquo;squeak&rdquo;, I didn&rsquo;t know how long it had been chased. Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s breathing became heavier and he felt tired and expected to have chased away for a long time.</p>
<p>But seeing the verdant bamboo forest in front of me, it seemed to be endless, coming one layer at a time. Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s mouth was dry, and he suddenly saw the gray shadow flashing in front of him, and he fell straight. He was overjoyed, and suddenly he got his spirit and rushed up, and at this moment, Tian Linger suddenly shouted, &ldquo;Be careful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In front of Zhang Xiaofan, Huo Ran appeared a cliff, Zhang Xiaofan quickly closed his feet, almost fell. He settled down, but saw a deep valley under the cliff. There was thick fog in the middle and far of the valley, which could not be seen clearly, and the nearby wall was no longer black knot bamboo, but various wild trees and wild pine trees. They have already chased the valley far away from Houshan.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan saw that the gray monkey had fallen down, and reapplied in the air. He grasped the branches and fluttered away, so he turned away the power of falling and fled forward.</p>
<p>He was in a hurry, and suddenly heard the sound of breaking the sky. He looked up and saw Tian Linger&rsquo;s red clothes fluttering, and Yu Yu came from the sky. He extended a jade-like hand to him and called, &ldquo;Come up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan couldn&rsquo;t think much. He stretched out his hand and grabbed Tian Ling&rsquo;er. Tian Linger pulled him hard and pulled him over Zhu Ling. &ldquo;Amber Zhu Ling&rdquo; suddenly sank, but immediately returned to its original state.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan had this experience for the first time, and he was helpless. Tian Linger pulled him behind him, and said, &ldquo;Hug my waist, hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan hugged him by his words, and Tian Ling&rsquo;er could not wait to lead Aya to fly. The red shadow passed by, and the two guarded the &ldquo;Amber Zhu Aya&rdquo;, rushed into the deep valley, and chased towards the figure of the gray monkey.</p>
<p>The wind was terrible, Zhang Xiaofan felt so loud that he couldn&rsquo;t even open his eyes, but the &ldquo;Amber Zhu Ling&rdquo; under his feet seemed to be soft and soft. It made people feel that they would fall off carelessly. I couldn’t help but hugged Tian Ling&rsquo;er tightly, I just felt that the red clothes were floating like clouds, and my sister’s back was like a fairy in nine days, so beautiful and faintly fragrant, floating in my nose, he felt a burst of joy in his heart. I hope this time will not pass away the best.</p>
<p>Where did Tian Ling&rsquo;er think of the little boy behind him, all his heart was on the gray monkey in front of him. She was favored and praised by her parents and fellow teachers on weekdays, and she was proud of her temper. Now she can’t catch up with a monkey, which is unacceptable.</p>
<p>So in the deep valley, between the tree shadows, but seeing the gray shadow in front, the red shadow was chasing after, dangling around, chasing and running.</p>
<p>So after chasing for another half hour, the gray monkey didn&rsquo;t know what kind of alien it was, even though he didn&rsquo;t feel tired, he was still running fast. But after such a long chase, Tian Ling&rsquo;er has gradually become familiar with the method of shuttle in the forest, and sees him getting closer and closer.</p>
<p>The gray monkey fled all the way to the depths of the valley, and Zhang Xiaofan looked forward from behind Tian Ling&rsquo;er, and saw that the trees at the front were getting thinner, the light came in, and there was a vaguely empty space, as if there were still sounds of water. At this time, the gray monkey screamed more and more quickly. It seemed that the two of them did not give up after chasing for a long time, but they did not retreat. They had to flee forward.</p>
<p>Before long, Huo Ran lit up, and it turned out to be an open space, the ground was full of gravel, and there was a little bitan in the middle, the water was rippling and flowing westward. The gray monkey fled here, obviously hesitating, but the sound of breaking behind him blinked, and had to fall to the ground, and then ran forward. But somehow, its pace has become extremely slow, where it seems to escape, it is almost the same as walking. Rao is so, it is still moving forward step by step.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan looked strange in his eyes, but Tian Ling&rsquo;er wanted to quickly avoid obstacles while paying attention to the monkey trails. He was very concentrated. Where did he think so much? Seeing the gray monkey was right in front of him, overjoyed, screamed, drove Aya straightly entered, rushed into the open ground, and rushed towards the gray monkey.</p>
<p>Seeing that he was about to catch the monkey, Zhang Xiaofan suddenly banged in his head, his body shook involuntarily twice, and a nausea sensation emerged from the five internal organs, rushed to the head, and his body shook for a moment. Zhang Xiaofan was shocked and at a loss. At this moment, his chest suddenly became hot, and a burst of warmth radiated away, protecting his heart, and then offset that nausea.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan looked subconsciously to his chest and felt that the heating was from the deep purple beads that Pu Zhi sent him. At the same time, Tian Ling&rsquo;er&rsquo;s body suddenly shook twice, and his body fell down.</p>
<p>The two of them were in the air, and once Tian Linger got out of control, Amber Zhu Ling stopped immediately, and the two fell off the air.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan rolled a few times in the ground, it was so painful, but he couldn&rsquo;t take care of so many, and before he stood up, he quickly shouted: &ldquo;Sister, Sister, are you okay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I saw Tian Ling&rsquo;er lay down in front of him, motionless, his face pale and sweating, and he had passed out.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was overwhelmed, guessing that most of them had something to do with the strange feeling just now. He immediately tolerated the pain and ran up to Tian Ling&rsquo;er, pushing her several times, but Tian Ling&rsquo;er still didn&rsquo;t respond.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan looked around again and saw that the pool of green water was the center, within three feet, there was no grass growing, but outside the three feet, the forest was lush. He gritted his teeth, resisting the disgusting feelings from time to time in his heart, picked up Tian Ling&rsquo;er, and at the same time picked up the amber Zhu Ling who was thrown away, and walked out.</p>
<p>This two-foot distance is not worth mentioning at ordinary times, but under the disgusting feeling of invading from time to time, it is actually very difficult to walk. Finally, he walked out of his feet and came under a big pine tree, and the disgusting feeling immediately disappeared.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan put down Tian Ling&rsquo;er, gasping for breath, looking at the water pool, and saw that the gray monkey stayed there, no longer walking, full of pain, looking here, looking for help. meaning.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan frowned, after all he couldn&rsquo;t bear it, got up and walked inwards again. After a few steps, the nausea reappeared, and the warmth in the chest reappeared, resisting the discomfort.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan walked slowly to the monkey, already sweating a lot, and the gray monkey saw him coming around, motionless, and seemed to be overwhelmed. Zhang Xiaofan took a deep breath, leaned over to pick up the monkey, turned around and walked out. The gray monkey was very obedient at this time, quietly lying in his arms.</p>
<p>Finally, he walked out again and walked to Tian Ling&rsquo;er, who was still unconscious, and the nausea disappeared. Zhang Xiaofan put the gray monkey down and sat down on the ground, gasping for breath. The gray monkey was also relieved, lying on the ground, his eyes dizzying and wandering, but he did not run away, just looked at Zhang Xiaofan.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan unbuttoned his shirt and took out the bead tied with a red rope to examine it carefully. I saw that the dark purple appearance had turned into lavender, and the green air inside seemed to be stimulated by it. Ten times, he kept turning and rushed around the appearance of the bead. As before, every time Qingqi hits, there will be a Buddhist mantra &ldquo;*&rdquo; to block it. The warmth that saved Zhang Xiaofan just now was also uploaded from this mantra.</p>
<p>However, Zhang Xiaofan clearly saw that, compared with when he first discovered it three years ago, the Buddha&rsquo;s &ldquo;*&rdquo; mantra has been inferior in terms of size and brightness.</p>
