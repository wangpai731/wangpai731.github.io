      <p>All of a sudden, things suddenly changed in the dark. The disciples of the longevity hall were shocked for a moment, and didn&rsquo;t react immediately.</p>
<p>In this moment of lightning and stone fire, the people who had been prepared for the right path appeared one after another, and each of them controlled the magic weapon and killed them. It&rsquo;s a great advantage to kill those who don&rsquo;t want to. All the disciples here are excellent successors from all schools. They may not be as good as yuyangzi in cultivating Taoism, but they are far better than ordinary people.</p>
<p>This moment is like a tiger in a flock. Zhengmo and Yaodao always hate each other. They will not be merciful when they start. They only see all kinds of lights flash in the night, scream and scream. The bloody air suddenly rises and floats in the swamp.</p>
<p>At the front end of all kinds of lights, there is a bright green cold light. It is the Dragon cutting sword of Lin Jingyu, the disciple of dragon head peak of Qingyun gate.</p>
<p>This young man, who had never appeared before, suddenly became so dazzling. The Dragon cutting sword roared, the green light rose to the sky, wrapped its owner, and rushed into the hall of eternal life.</p>
<p>It was the most brilliant light in the night. His eyes were cold, but there seemed to be fanaticism in the deep pupil, as if he was eager for the blood bursting out from the cold ahead.</p>
<p>Several of the leading members of the longevity hall, after passing by the green light, turned into a blood shower.</p>
<p>The crowd roared and surrounded each other, but Lin Jingyu seemed to ignore the enemies coming from behind. He only looked ahead and rushed straight to the place with the most people. He could not be killed vertically and horizontally. Where he passed, he was bloody.</p>
<p>After a while, other orthodox disciples also followed up, each of them produced magic weapons and fought with the disciples of Changsheng hall.</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai was still shaken by Lin Jingyu in the chaos of the war. He shouted loudly: &ldquo;younger martial brother Lin, be careful&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that Lin Jingyu doesn&rsquo;t seem to hear any warning from others. At this moment, he is totally different from the young man who was studying at dragon head peak. He is holding a dragon cutting sword and making a devil killing light!</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how many immortal disciples surrounded him. However, he did not look back. The Dragon cutting sword flickered and waved in the night, and countless blood rose and fell in front of him, drenched his clothes.</p>
<p>Later. Countless disciples of the longevity hall chased after him, but few in front of him dared to resist. Everyone fled and did not dare to face this crazy man.</p>
<p>until.</p>
<p>In the dark, there was a shrill &ldquo;whine&rdquo; sound. The white light flashed. A round thing whirled rapidly and fell from the sky. It fell on Lin Jingyu&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu shouts. The Dragon cutting sword that is flying to kill the enemy flies back in a flash. He grabs it and stabs it straight to the sky. In a flash, it&rsquo;s so bright that it rises up in the air. But the disk thing in the air is even more powerful. Black light and white awn appear alternately, unexpectedly, they are in a green light, and they are hard pressed down.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu changes color for the first time. He knows that there are experts in the hall of longevity. Although the unknown magic weapon in the air is not impressive, he ignores the sharp and unmatched sword of the Dragon cutting sword. With heavy pressure, he quickly presses it down.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu&rsquo;s face suddenly understood a few points with the pressure of the disc. He roared loudly and the whole person flew out. Only a moment later, the disk rumbled down, making a huge pit out of the place where he had stood, which was very powerful. Obviously, this man is also extremely resentful.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu&rsquo;s body straightens out, and the Qingyun disciples see it behind him, and they come up to meet him one after another. But he just rushed into the crowd of the immortal hall, surrounded by enemies. Before he could get to his feet, he felt a sharp pain. In a moment, three or four blades had already cut into his body.</p>
<p>Blood spring spray, bright as flowers, dyed his clothes red. Lin Jingyu&rsquo;s eyes twitched, but he didn&rsquo;t flinch and fear at all. The light of the dragon sword was flying in his own blood, but it was more dazzling. He whirled around and screamed loudly. Three or four students of the hall of eternal life staggered back. They broke their arms and spit blood. They were dead.</p>
<p>People looked at the young man&rsquo;s bravery and looked at him for a while.</p>
<p>After a while, the righteous people came to kill one after another. The people in the hall of longevity dare not fight and retreat. Where Lin Jingyu was defeated just now, Yu Yangzi slowly appeared, with a ferocious face. Where else is the immortal posture in the half normal day?</p>
<p>At this time, the fighting in the field stopped gradually, and the disciples of Changsheng hall gradually returned to yuyangzi&rsquo;s back. The young disciples of Zhengdao also stood together. Xiao Yicai, FA Xiang, Li Xun and others stood at the front end, and xiaozhufeng Wenmin came to help Lin Jingyu to bandage the wound and stop bleeding. At the same time, he whispered: &ldquo;how can you not take your life seriously?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu and Wen Min were just at the beginning of Tongtian peak, but now they were suddenly taken care of by her. They were shocked.</p>
<p>In the past ten years, he learned from the mysterious old man in the ancestral hall of tongtianfeng, Qingyun gate. With his own qualifications and perseverance, he finally achieved great success. Today, he really shakes the whole audience. Everyone is impressed.</p>
<p>But after this strange elder martial sister asked, Lin Jingyu didn&rsquo;t know how to answer for a while and couldn&rsquo;t speak. Wen Min has always been very kind-hearted. Seeing Lin Jingyu&rsquo;s half body bleeding and taking advantage of the rare gap at present, he helped him to bandage it. However, the situation was urgent, and he also wrapped it casually. Then he whispered: &ldquo;there will be a fierce battle later. Be careful yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu nodded and said in a low voice, &ldquo;thank you very much, elder martial sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wenmin smiled and walked to one side. Standing beside Lu Xueqi, Lu Xueqi looked at Lin Jingyu. There was no expression on her face, but there was light in her eyes.</p>
<p>In front of the longevity hall, yuyangzi&rsquo;s face was cold. The only left right hand tightly grasped the magic weapon &ldquo;Yin Yang mirror&rdquo;, and the blue tendons appeared on the straight hand.</p>
<p>This time, the attack on the right way, unexpectedly, was put together by these right way kids. He glanced at it roughly. In a short time, the hall of longevity had lost one third of its staff. But there was almost no damage on the side of the orthodox disciples. Lin Jingyu was cut several times, but it seemed that he was the most seriously injured one.</p>
<p>Li Xun is looking at the disciples of the immortal Hall of the demon sect in front of him. His eyes are shining. Suddenly, he whispers: &ldquo;elder martial brother Xiao is really clever, I admire him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai smiled and said, &ldquo;it just happens that there are many places in the future to borrow senior brother Li. I hope that senior brother Li will give me some advice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li Xun obviously did not dare to look down on Xiao Yicai at the moment, so he nodded: &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, Faxiang&rsquo;s eyes stopped for a moment on Lin Jingyu, who was injured. It seemed that he intended to go there for sympathy, but he finally held back. Since Qingyun gate and Tianyin Temple met, both sides get along well, but Lin Jingyu is the only one in Qingyun gate. The reason for the coldness of the monks in Tianyin temple is clear to everyone. It&rsquo;s just the scars of that year. No one wants to mention the past. So for a long time, the monks of Tianyin temple have been deliberately and unintentionally avoiding Lin Jingyu.</p>
<p>But at the moment, when Lin Jingyu is injured, FA Xiang still cares about it. He turns to Xiao Yicai and whispers, &ldquo;elder martial brother Xiao, isn&rsquo;t the injury of younger martial brother Lin Jingyu too serious?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai saw Wen Min go to bandage the wound for Lin Jingyu.</p>
<p>At the moment, he looks at Wenmin&rsquo;s office. Wenmin knows what he wants and shakes his head slightly. Xiao Yicai just gives up his mind and says to Faxiang, &ldquo;younger martial brother Lin is not in any way. You don&rsquo;t have to worry about Faxiang.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Dharma phase bowed its head and combined its ten parts, and praised the Buddha&rsquo;s name lightly.</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai took a deep breath, looked forward, and said in a loud voice: &ldquo;elder yuyangzi, how can you say that you are also an elder. Changshengtang is one of the four major sects of the demon sect. How can we use these three abusive methods to make people laugh? &quot;</p>
<p>Yu Yangzi was furious and said, &ldquo;you so-called famous and decent sects, don&rsquo;t ambush us as well. They are still talking loudly here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai&rsquo;s face changed, and he said with awe: &ldquo;we, the younger generation, are going out again. Naturally, we should be careful to prevent the evil villains from secretly harming us. Unexpectedly, what we are waiting for is hey. Haha! &quot;</p>
<p>Xiaoyi is far younger than yuyangzi, but he has a sharp tongue. In a few words, yuyangzi&rsquo;s seven tips make a smoke and roar. Come first, then all the people of Changsheng hall will see the leader of the sect and kill one after another. Xiao Yicai and other outstanding Taoists stopped Yu Yangzi and killed others.</p>
<p>Originally, it was not so easy to be stimulated by Xiao Yicai because of yuyangzi&rsquo;s cultivation manner. But seeing the only strength of changshengtang, he lost a lot in vain at the moment. He was very sad and angry. However, Xiao Yicai scolded people without dirty words and sarcastic sentences. Even though Meng Ji was still a little sober, just wanted to dissuade him, Yu Yangzi had already rushed out.</p>
<p>Yuyangzi, who has been the head of Changsheng hall for hundreds of years, has his own real talent. Even if he lost his left arm in Qingyun World War I ten years ago, he lost a lot in Taoism, but Xiao Yicai alone is definitely not his opponent.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that this one-on-one thing doesn&rsquo;t happen. Among Xiao Yicai, FA Xiang is on the left, and Li Xun is on the right. The three most outstanding young people of today&rsquo;s Zhengdao stopped Yu Yangzi and fought together.</p>
<p>Yuyangzi rose to the top with one hand and one arm, one enemy and three enemies. The magic weapon of Yin Yang mirror in his hand is unpredictable, black and white, and dark light bursts. The magic light attacked by Xiao Yicai and others is either blocked by the mirror, or pulled to one side by Yu Yangzi. He can&rsquo;t get close at all.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, when the white side of the yin-yang mirror turns over, the magic weapon of the three people will be counter shocked back to attack the master.</p>
<p>At the beginning, the three people didn&rsquo;t expect that the magic weapon had this magical function, almost all of them suffered great losses. Li Xun&rsquo;s left arm was wiped by his magic weapon &ldquo;Nine Yang feet&rdquo;, almost becoming the same one arm man as Yu Yangzi in front of him.</p>
<p>None of the three dare to be careless and deal with it carefully. With one enemy and three talents in the right way, yuyangzi still has the upper hand. He is really good at Taoism.</p>
<p>However, although yuyangzi himself is powerful, his disciples are far behind him in their Taoism. In the face of this group of high quality and magic weapons, all of them are the top disciples. Although there are a large number of them, they gradually fall behind.</p>
<p>In addition to those monks in Tianyin temple, Qingyun sect and the demon sect are as hostile as the sea. All the disciples of Qingyun sect are ferocious, and the burning incense Valley is not inferior to Qingyun sect.</p>
<p>Yu Yangzi was trapped by these three people. Although he was in the upper hand, he was unable to escape for a while. During the fierce fight, he looked around. He saw only a few people, including Meng Ji, who were struggling to support him. Other ordinary people were gradually losing their morale and half of the casualties.</p>
<p>Meng Ji forced back a disciple of burning incense Valley in front of him. He looked anxious and shouted to Yu Yangzi, &ldquo;sect leader!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yuyangzi gnashed his teeth and was furious, but finally he knew that the situation was gone. If he could fight on, the last foundation of the hall of longevity would be consumed here. He had to shout: &ldquo;all people leave first, and I will break later!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as this remark came out, the disciples of the longevity hall fled to the darkness behind them. Right here, Xiao Yicai and others were so alert. At the same time, all the magic weapons flashed and rushed to Yu Yangzi.</p>
<p>Yuyangzi roared, but he didn&rsquo;t dodge. The yin-yang mirror went up in a hurry. &ldquo;When&rdquo; to block the flying of the &ldquo;reincarnation beads&rdquo; from faxiangyu, the moment from black to white, Xiao Yicai body a shock, only to see the flying seven-star sword suddenly out of control. When the attack comes back, the sword is fierce. I&rsquo;m in a hurry for a moment. The formula is applied continuously. Then I can control the seven star sword again.</p>
<p>Only for a moment. Yuyangzi has pulled the Nine Yang feet attacked by Li Xun aside. The attack of the three men is one of them. However, yuyangzi does not take the opportunity to escape, but his figure rises and falls into the crowd.</p>
<p>Other disciples of the righteous way are chasing and killing the disciples of the long life hall who are fleeing, but Yu Yangzi suddenly kills them. &ldquo;Teng Teng&rdquo; several times. He immediately injures several people under his hands, and several of them are hit by the yin-yang mirror and fly out. Fall in the dark, suddenly scream, a moment later it will be silent, just afraid to fall in the bottomless pit here, and then die.</p>
<p>In the night, Yu Yangzi looked up and down, left and right in the crowd, to cover the escape of the students of the longevity hall, where he went, in front of the black and white light of the yin-yang mirror. The orthodox disciples retreat one after another. They are really powerful.</p>
<p>And in the distance, several looming figures standing in the dark are also focusing on the situation in the field. In particular, Yu Yangzi, who was staring at him with great power.</p>
<p>With the rush of yuyangzi, the pressure of the students of the longevity hall suddenly relaxed. In an instant, they withdrew most of them, leaving behind a corpse. Yuyangzi saw it in his eyes, and it was a heartache.</p>
<p>But at this time. Xiao Yicai and others have already caught up in the right way. At this moment, we have added song Daren, Zeng Shushu, Wen Min, FA Shan of Tianyin temple, and Gu Yanhong, who burn incense. There are eight of them. All of them come out together and surround Yu Yangzi.</p>
<p>There was a sharp howl from yuyangzi. The fierce parts of his nature were all brought into play, but there was no fear. The yin-yang mirror turns and dances. It covers the left and blocks the right. It leads the counter attack. It kills the eight people at the same place, from the ground to the air, and from the air to the ground.</p>
<p>But after all, there are many people in the main road, and the road is not low. No matter how powerful yuyangzi is, he will be outnumbered, and the momentum of the yin-yang mirror will be gradually suppressed.</p>
<p>In the right way, eight people jump up and down and cooperate with each other gradually. Although it&rsquo;s not good to see eight people besieging one person, just add a sentence &ldquo;this is the devil of the evil cult&rdquo;. Naturally, you can feel at ease, take life and go to the harm.</p>
<p>However, Yu Yangzi has been practicing Taoism for hundreds of years. He is exposed to the light of the sword. Although he gradually has no power of backhand and the pressure around him is increasing, Xiao Yicai and others can&rsquo;t attack him even though they are crazy.</p>
<p>Moreover, he moved his body to drive the battle group and swam to the side. If it wasn&rsquo;t Xiao Yi, he would be smart. Suddenly, he remembered that one of his disciples had just died and shouted out, &ldquo;be careful to fall into the swamp!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This reminds people that after a while, they find that they have been secretly taken to the abyss by yuyangzi. If they are not careful, someone will fall into it, which is really dangerous.</p>
<p>Yuyangzi still has this fixed vision and experience in the chaos of war. Naturally, these young people are not comparable.</p>
<p>But now even though he has more experience and great practice, he is also outstanding in the face of a group of young masters with such a calm vision.</p>
<p>At the same time, the eight headed by Xiao Yicai made efforts, and in an instant, countless strange lights and different lights hit Yu Yangzi&rsquo;s yin-yang mirror. Yuyangzi was shocked all over, but he felt a lot of pressure, such as mountains and seas, waves and waves. After the opponent&rsquo;s exertion, he can rest a little, but he can only resist and cannot return. After ten times of blocking, he finally can&rsquo;t resist, so he has to back away and gradually away from the bottomless pit.</p>
<p>After leaving the bottomless pit, the people in the middle of the road immediately put down their minds, and even more let go to besiege yuyangzi.</p>
<p>Yu Yangzi began to struggle, and the light from the corner of his eyes looked around. At this moment, most of the disciples of Changsheng hall had already withdrawn. Meng Ji and a few others were coming to meet him. However, there were more orthodox disciples around.</p>
<p>When Yu Yangzi was cold in his heart, he knew that if he was surrounded by these twenty or thirty people, he would die even if he was a Taoist. At the moment, he stopped the Xuanyuan sword that had been attacked from the front of the book and shouted: &ldquo;go quickly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meng Ji and others were stunned and fled. Yuyangzi didn&rsquo;t want to fight. The yin-yang mirror flashed again and again. Suddenly, the white light was so bright that he attacked five magic weapons around him in a flash. He was shocked back together and attacked the master.</p>
<p>In the right way, unexpectedly, he had such ability. There was a sudden confusion and a small gap in the formation.</p>
<p>How experienced is yuyangzi. At once, he turned himself into a strange light and rushed there like electricity.</p>
<p>He was so moving that the next moment he reached the gap and was about to rush out. Xiao Yicai and others are far behind him, unable to catch up.</p>
<p>But at this moment, Bi Guangdun, brilliant and eye-catching, the dragon sword is fierce. Split face to face. Look at the momentum. I really want to split yuyangzi into two pieces.</p>
<p>Yuyangzi was caught off guard, but at the critical moment of his life and death, he still forcefully moved his body to the right by three points, and then the green light chopped down from his side, and his sleeves fluttered, which was twisted into pieces by the green light.</p>
<p>Yu Yangzi&rsquo;s left arm was broken early, but he took advantage of it. Otherwise, it is unknown whether he can keep calm under the sharp pain, but there is a burning pain in his left body, I&rsquo;m afraid that he was hurt by bimang, the Dragon cutting fierce sword. His body kept turning, his right hand turned, and the yin-yang mirror suddenly shone with black light. He only heard a groan, and Lin Jingyu staggered back. All the wounds he had just bandaged burst.</p>
<p>Blood again!</p>
<p>At this moment, there is no right disciple standing in the way. Yuyangzi is just about to exert his power and curse at the same time. Today, I have been humiliated by these righteous people, and I will retaliate 100 times in the future.</p>
<p>On top of the dead water, there was a sudden thunder!</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s eyes!</p>
<p>A bright blue light, across the sky, the sky dark clouds such as ink rapid rotation, such as ferocious whirlpool. Lu Xueqi stands in the air, the wind is fierce, her unique appearance is like ice and frost!</p>
<p>In the far darkness, it seems that someone&rsquo;s body slightly shakes.</p>
<p>The beautiful woman, standing in the air, took seven steps in the air, chanted the mantra in her mouth, and suddenly the light in the sky flashed like a giant snake in the clouds.</p>
<p>Yuyangzi&rsquo;s face changed a lot, but before he had any reaction, Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s &ldquo;magic sword against thunder&rdquo; had been launched, only to see the huge electric light falling down, hitting the end of the sword, blue light was great, and in a moment, it lit up the dark half of the sky.</p>
<p>At this moment, Lu Xueqi can&rsquo;t compete with Zhang Xiaofan any more. She can only see the light in the sky reflected in her deep pupil, as if she has returned to the past years!</p>
<p>The huge light column, refracted down, didn&rsquo;t reach the ground, the right disciples nearby have retreated one after another. Within a few feet of yuyangzi&rsquo;s side, the wind is howling, the trees, water and grass are uprooted, and the power is amazing!</p>
<p>Yuyangzi makes a long roar, his clothes are all puffed up, and the yin-yang mirror is suspended, emitting black-and-white two-color light, which is instantly integrated into one. Obviously, after yuyangzi&rsquo;s fight, he has done his best to resist!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boom&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A huge column of light hit yuyangzi&rsquo;s yin-yang mirror. In a moment, yuyangzi&rsquo;s body was pressed into the ground for a minute. Yuyangzi&rsquo;s face flashed with pain, but Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s body in the sky was suddenly shocked, and her face was white.</p>
<p>However, the huge light column in the field has not been reduced. It has been shot continuously from the magic sword in the end of the world. The electric light flashes in disorder and it is hit fiercely. Yuyangzi is supported by one arm and his face is increasingly ugly. If it is not for the power of the magic sword&rsquo;s real formula to resist thunder, the disciples of the right way can&rsquo;t insert it. Otherwise, at the moment, thousands of swords and thousands of swords fall together and yuyangzi will be made into meat sauce in an instant.</p>
<p>Yuyangzi&rsquo;s eyes were full of resentment. After a moment, his muscles twisted. He bit fiercely, broke his tongue, and sprayed blood on the yin-yang mirror. Somehow, the yin-yang mirror was full of time. Unexpectedly, it forced Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s huge light pillar back.</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai and other people saw something wrong and jumped on it one after another. With a sound of LiXiao, Yu Yangzi flew up and the yin-yang mirror swept behind him. The spirit of the yin-yang mirror, inspired by his own blood essence, was surging. Xiao Yicai and other people dared not take it hard and retreated one after another.</p>
<p>Although yuyangzi&rsquo;s move is powerful, it can be seen that after the fierce fight, he used this fierce and strange skill again, which was already a great injury to his vitality, and he even stumbled a few times. But the man was really clear, so in this case, he still raised a strong breath, flew away, and finally disappeared in the dark.</p>
<p>Li Xun and others still have to catch up. Xiao Yicai immediately weighs the advantages and disadvantages, stops them loudly, and says: &ldquo;the poor can&rsquo;t catch up! We are not familiar with the danger here. Be careful! &quot;</p>
<p>Although Li Xun was not willing to do so, Xiao Yi did not know what was going on tonight. He admired him, so he stopped.</p>
<p>This night, this war finally ended in the tragic defeat of the immortal devil sect.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the conflagration of Zhengmo and Zhengdao. There are some losses in Zhengdao, but compared with the longevity hall, it&rsquo;s too good. (to be continued. )</p>
