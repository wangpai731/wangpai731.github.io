      <p>Three days passed.</p>
<p>The watchman in the ghost King&rsquo;s stone chamber, his face has changed from calm and indifferent to uneasiness, and then to anxiety, and now is full of irritability and impatience. For him, although he had made this astrolabe, after all, was not an ordinary treasure, and it took quite a long time to prepare for the mystery. But he never thought that it would take him three days. What&rsquo;s more, it seems that Mr. ghost has not made any progress in these three days.</p>
<p>According to his original idea, when Mr. GUI first touched the astrolabe, he caused some changes in the astrolabe. He should have some knowledge of this treasure. As long as he understands it for several days, it is not difficult to understand the mystery. Who knows, during these three days, he watched Mr. ghost turn the artifact upside down and look at it all the time. He even thought that Mr. ghost should remember all the ancient characters on the small pieces of jade that could not move in the middle of the jade plate.</p>
<p>However, Mr. ghost is obviously in a dilemma. In other words, Mr. ghost has encountered great difficulties in understanding this treasure. He has not made any progress in a few days.</p>
<p>Compared with other people&rsquo;s chambers in huqishan grottoes, the grotto where the ghost king lived is naturally much more spacious. It is divided into two parts. The larger room on the outside is the place where GUI Li and Mr. GUI understand the astrolabe, and the smaller one on the inner side is naturally the bedroom of the ghost king. Although the ghost king was not there, neither GUI Li nor Mr. GUI stepped into the inner room for the past three days. According to their deeds, they could not say that they did not sleep for ten days and ten nights.</p>
<p>But the most difficult part is still &ldquo;waiting&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In the past three days, he stayed in the stone room, but he was very active. He didn&rsquo;t move for three days, which made him suffocate. At the moment, GUI Li and Mr. GUI are still staring at the treasure. After three days, they were too lazy to pay attention to Xiao Hui.</p>
<p>Xiao Hui ran around in this stone room. After three days, he was familiar with every corner. At this time, he jumped on the big desk of the ghost king. In ordinary times, no one dares to do so, but at this moment, the emperor is far away from the sky, and no one is actually in charge of it.</p>
<p>Small ash bored, in the big desk for a while to lie down, a while to climb up.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, it was too boring to be alone. I had to sit up again and hold my head. My mouth made a low &ldquo;squeak&rdquo; sound and looked around for fun.</p>
<p>Although the stone room is spacious, there is no room for exaggeration. So it&rsquo;s natural that its eyes look into the inner room. Xiao Hui scratched his head and looked back at GUI Li. He saw that Gui Li&rsquo;s face was gloomy, and a bit of anger appeared on his face. Obviously, he was in a bad mood. However, Mr. GUI was concentrating on the light white and soft star chart in his hand. Occasionally, he raised his eyes, and then took back his eyes.</p>
<p>Both of them obviously focused on the chart. Even if a little more vigilance, at most, it is just to look at each other. No one cares more about the monkey here, even a little bit. Xiao Hui shrugged his shoulders and turned his mouth. &ldquo;Tut tut&rdquo; murmured twice, the tail wagged twice, turned around, looked at the inner room for a while, then jumped off the desk and walked slowly.</p>
<p>Xiao Hui sat beside them for a while. It&rsquo;s boring again soon. In fact, it can&rsquo;t be blamed. Who stayed by these two people for three days and three nights only to see them do the same thing would be boring, not to mention the monkeys who are naturally active?</p>
<p>At this time, Mr. ghost seems to have found something. He suddenly pointed to the moving small jade blocks in the center of the jade plate and said to the ghost, &ldquo;I think the key point of this treasure is on these sliding jade blocks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li nodded slowly. Obviously, he agreed with this view in his heart, but he frowned slightly and said, &ldquo;but we haven&rsquo;t seen why these jade blocks can slide automatically after watching for three days. What&rsquo;s your opinion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost pondered for a moment and said, &ldquo;have you ever thought that the gliding track of these jade blocks is quite similar to that of the stars in the sky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a while, he clapped his hands and said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s reasonable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. GUI said: &ldquo;in fact, I am not sure, but I feel so. Even though these jade pieces slide into the sky and stars, there are still many unsolved mysteries. I think that if you want to understand this treasure, the most important place is on the ancient characters of these jade blocks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He nodded slowly.</p>
<p>The two kept talking and answering each other. Soon they were immersed in the treasure of the astrolabe again. Xiaohui sat beside them for a long time and then turned away.</p>
<p>In the stone chamber, there were constant whispers of GUI Li and Mr. ghost. After looking around for a moment, Xiao Hui quietly walked into the inner room.</p>
<p>On the stone wall, which has just been torn off the wall by the small ash, there are some traces. There is a light color difference with the surrounding stone walls. It seems that this painting has been hanging here for some time. Except for the four paintings on the stone wall, there are only wooden beds, tables and chairs in this inner room, and there is nothing interesting. Xiaohui felt and rubbed around, and soon got bored again.</p>
<p>When it was really boring, suddenly three eyes suddenly lit up, as if to find something, and then hopped, the whole body suddenly jumped to the king of ghosts&rsquo; big bed, and no matter how dirty the bed bedding, it actually rolled on it. The stone room is simple but very clean. I think the ghost king himself is a clean man. I don&rsquo;t know if he would get angry if he saw a scene after he came back.</p>
<p>But at the moment, Xiaohui doesn&rsquo;t care so much. Anyway, no one cares about it at present. It looks like it bumps into something in a corner of the bed, and the whole bed suddenly vibrates.</p>
<p>Then, on the stone wall close to the bed, there was a big crack, and then slowly and silently retreated to both sides, revealing a big hole that could allow one to enter and leave.</p>
<p>As early as the moment when the bed vibrated, Xiao Hui already felt something. He jumped down and lay prone on the ground. He looked at it suspiciously. Until he saw a secret door quietly exposed on the stone wall, he slowly stood up and took a look inside the secret door. But there was nothing to see, but there was no fierce monster, and the mysterious black hole. At this time, it seems that the monkey seems to have some sense of temptation to the bored monkey, and seems to be gently waving to it.</p>
<p>Xiao Hui grabs his head and looks back at the stone room outside. GUI Li and Mr. ghost fall into silence again. It seems that it was another long day of enlightenment. The three eyed monkey turned around, suddenly grinned and made a face. Then it jumped up slightly, but it got into the dark door black hole. Within a moment, the figure disappeared in the dark.</p>
<p>A gust of if there is no wind, from the stone wall that mysterious black hole gently blowing out, with a touch of bloody gas! As soon as you enter the stone wall hidden door. Xiaohui&rsquo;s third eye in the middle of his forehead flickered with gold, sending out some strange light. Under the light golden light, the originally dark cave could be seen clearly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not very smooth to walk on the passage that only allows one person to walk on it. However, it is more than enough for a monkey. Xiaohui walked in this passage for a short time with a sense of adventure, and then he felt his feet suddenly sink. The passage turned down.</p>
<p>The stone walls on both sides of the passageway gradually appear to be damp and humid in some places. Even drops of water trickled down in the dark. In the extremely silent passage, only the figure of Xiaohui is moving forward slowly. In the darkness ahead, there is still a light wind with a strange light smell of blood.</p>
<p>The downhill passage is not steep, but it is quite long. The small ash walked for a long time. It should be deep into the bottom of Huqi mountain. It is at this time that Xiaohui suddenly stops, and a faint red light lights up in a distant place ahead.</p>
<p>The monkey stood in the passage for a while, as if hesitating. After a moment, it looked back to the road, reached for its head, as if hesitating whether to go back to say to the master, but the red light in front of him seemed to flicker like a temptation.</p>
<p>Finally, after two squeaks, the monkey moved forward carefully.</p>
<p>Getting closer and closer to the red light, the original slight bloody smell in the channel gradually became strong, and the look on Xiaohui&rsquo;s face gradually became a little nervous. He stretched out his nose to smell it in the air, and his eyes were a little suspicious. But at the end of the day, seeing that the red awn was in front of us, it was still moving forward.</p>
<p>Finally, he arrived at hongmang. It turned out that this was another hole in the passage. Xiaohui poked out his head from here, looked around a few times, and jumped out. A moment later, he was on the road several times more spacious than the one before.</p>
<p>In addition to the passage through which Xiaohui came in, there was also a channel connecting the road. It was just beside the passage where Xiaohui jumped down. However, it was as dark and gloomy as it was, and I didn&rsquo;t know where to go.</p>
<p>On the other side of the road, the darkness in the passage just now turned out to be bright, especially the red light flashing at the end of the road. It seems that the scene just seen from the distance by the small ash in the passage is the scene here.</p>
<p>It was still empty, and even at the end of the bright red awn, there was no strange sound.</p>
<p>When Xiaohui smelled the air, the bloody air was so strong that it seemed that it couldn&rsquo;t be dissolved. After a moment, Xiao Hui&rsquo;s eyes suddenly coagulated and fell on the entrance of the passage that he had just recently arrived. The originally blue stone wall turned dark red. The water slowly dripping from the wet place above the stone wall, in the light, was extremely bright red, just like blood. Drop by drop, drop by drop!</p>
<p>The golden eye light between the small gray forehead gradually lit up. After looking at the blood bead for a long time, it slowly turned back and looked at the red light shining in the distance. After a while, the monkey walked again and went there.</p>
<p>The Red Mansions flickered strangely, as if they were spiritually. They breathed gently and spread wildly slowly, drowning the slowly walking monkey figure.</p>
<p>It was late at night. Although the alternation of day and night could not be clearly felt in Huqi cave, outside the cave, the sky under the curtain of night was full of stars, and the stars were still shining on the world like countless past days. It also lit up some places on the dark bare Huqi mountain.</p>
<p>Under the starlight, a white figure suddenly floated from the distance. It seemed that it had no weight at all. It was like a fallen leaf in the wind. It was blown by the night wind between the mountains and fields, and slowly fell on the top of Huqi mountain. By the faint starlight, the white graceful figure turned around. Show eyebrow water eye, ice muscle snow skin, a faint enchantment that can&rsquo;t be swung, makes people palpitating, Lingering between the eyebrows and eyes. It&rsquo;s Jiuwei Tianhu Xiaobai.</p>
<p>At the moment, Xiaobai e&rsquo;s eyebrows are locked and her face is rarely heavy. Standing on the top of Huqi mountain, the night wind is blowing. There was no tree to shelter her from the wind, which made her dress flutter and show her plump and attractive figure. Xiaobai slowly looked around. Today&rsquo;s Huqi mountain is full of rubbles, not to mention trees. There is not even a weed.</p>
<p>Looking at the desolate scenery, who would believe that this place was still a beautiful place decades ago?</p>
<p>Others don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Xiaobai knows that, because the Fangyuan area of Huqi mountain is the birthplace and living place of the fox demon clan. She grew up here since she was a child. The mountains, rivers, plants and trees here are different from other places.</p>
<p>But, all that I don&rsquo;t know when, all mysteriously disappeared, and the only thing left was the desolation in front of me.</p>
<p>Xiaobai squatted down slowly. He held out his white palm and gently grasped a handful of soil from the ground. No, it should be said that it was sand. The land on Huqi mountain is cracked and only gravel is left. The hard sand and stone are scattered in the tender palm. Xiaobai looks at the sand in his hand carefully, and his eyes twinkle. It seems that he wants to see something from the small gravel.</p>
<p>After a moment. She slowly closed her hand, clenched it into a fist, and released it gently. The gravel slipped quietly from between her fingers, but in the middle of the sky, it was blown away by the night wind from afar, reflecting a faint light under the stars and disappearing in the dark distance under the night sky.</p>
<p>The gravel here is no different from that in other places.</p>
<p>Xiaobai slowly stood up and looked up at the stars all over the sky. The starlight fell on her body, gently touching her body like a gentle hand, comforting her.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, her eyes suddenly opened, as if thinking of something, but then she did not see what big action, but rather strange, suddenly raised her foot, like a worldly girl when she was angry and coquettish, and heavily stepped on the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poof!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Low muffled sound, sounded in the night wind, blowing with the wind, a burst of smoke and dust, and gently falling in the wind. A moment later, from the ground under Xiaobai&rsquo;s feet, a strange sound came from the &ldquo;crackling&rdquo; sound, which lasted for half a cup of tea for a long time, and then gradually calmed down.</p>
<p>The corner of Xiaobai&rsquo;s mouth was closed, and her white body curled up like duckweed, like being held up by the wind. However, her eyes filled with water were just staring at the ground under her feet. After a while, she was in the air, and suddenly her sleeve robe was spread, but she brushed to the ground.</p>
<p>Even at night, there were several sharp sounds in the sky. When the sleeve robe brushed the ground, the sand and rocks were flying and the dust was dancing. In the air, Xiaobai didn&rsquo;t stop. The sleeve robe was waving down continuously. After seven times of brushing, the dust on the ground had become a small gray tornado, full of gravel, whirling rapidly and sweeping up under the night starlight.</p>
<p>Xiaobai whistled softly, and her figure suddenly rose a little more than a Zhang. Under the starlight, her white shadow floated like a fairy, which made people dazzled and had a charming beauty. As her figure rose, the tornado composed of sand and gravel was suddenly pulled up by an invisible force, but it was blown out towards the opposite side of Xiaobai. How fast the wind speed was, after a moment, the wind column with countless sand and gravel had completely fallen into the distance. In the dark, there was a continuous roar, which was supposed to be the sound of those stones hitting the ground.</p>
<p>However, at Xiaobai&rsquo;s feet, a big hole with a width of six feet and a depth of more than ten feet appeared at the top of the original Huqi mountain. Xiaobai dug such a big hole in the hard mountain peak between her hands and feet. This Taoist practice is astonishing to the world, but it is not surprising from the perspective of her thousand year old Jiuwei Tianhu. But Xiaobai obviously didn&rsquo;t run to the top of the mountain to dig a hole in the middle of the night. She fell slowly from the air. Her eyes never left the cave. The white figure floated directly into the pit.</p>
<p>Once entering the pit, Xiaobai&rsquo;s body suddenly becomes very slow. It seems that there is something invisible holding her body under her feet. She also stares at the wall of the pit and looks at it with the light star light in the sky.</p>
<p>The white and delicate hand, pressed on the rough stone wall, forms a sharp contrast, has a kind of strange feeling. But Xiaobai didn&rsquo;t notice these things. She just fell slowly along her palm and her body, looking at the pit wall carefully.</p>
<p>It came into view. It is a bluish gray stone wall, rough and hard, and the tentacles are extremely cold. Then, as Xiaobai&rsquo;s body slowly drops, her eyes also slowly fall, down a foot. It is still as like as two peas and rocks.</p>
<p>She continued to descend, her white palm supporting the rock wall and falling gently. Two feet deep, it was still the same green gray hard rock.</p>
<p>One or two feet</p>
<p>Four feet</p>
<p>Five feet</p>
<p>No change, still so strong rock, cold feeling seems to have been passed on for thousands of years, until now suddenly see the sun. From the rough surface of the rock wall, it radiates coldly.</p>
<p>Xiaobai&rsquo;s face does not have any expression, the body is still gently falling, a moment later, suddenly, her eyes lit up, the body immediately in the air a shock, stopped.</p>
<p>On the cliff six feet above the ground, next to her white palm, finally. The first anomaly appeared on the hard rock.</p>
<p>A faint red mark, such as a tiny blood thread, appears on the stone.</p>
<p>Xiaobai stares at this tiny red mark tightly for a long time, and suddenly a sneer appears in the corner of his mouth. Then the body slowly to the fall, her eyes continue to stare at the stone wall. Sure enough, as her figure gradually declined, there were more and more anomalies in front of her. Originally, it should be more and more hard and blue gray rock, but now it shows more and more red marks on the stone wall. The color is getting deeper and deeper. After reaching the bottom of the pit more than ten meters deep, Xiaobai slowly turns around and looks at it. In front of her, there is a red rock wall with thick cracks everywhere. Around her, the rock wall is no longer cold, but sends out a strong bloody gas.</p>
<p>That shocking blood red, that kind of terror that will bite people! Xiaobai&rsquo;s eyes showed the disgust that could not be covered up. With a cold hum, the figure moved. The white figure rose to the sky, flew out of the cave and landed on the ground beside the pit. The starlight in the night fell on her white figure again, like water, washing away the nightmare scene of the previous year.</p>
<p>Xiaobai&rsquo;s face was indifferent and took a deep breath. Facing the night wind blowing from afar, he looked up at the sky. After a moment, she suddenly laughed and whispered: &ldquo;for thousands of years, there are always some people who don&rsquo;t know the height of heaven and earth. They want to do something stupid. Let&rsquo;s have a look at it together. Haha, hehe&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cold laughter in the night wind gently floating, with the wind, I do not know which corner of the world, and under the night, in the stars, that white beautiful figure, still standing on the top of the mountains, facing the wind, with a bit of amazing beauty, lonely and lonely.</p>
<p>This late night, it seems that many people also can not sleep, like something lingering in the heart and have inexplicable feelings, people always have some unspeakable feeling.</p>
<p>In the cave of Huqi mountain, GUI Li and Mr. GUI are still concentrating on understanding the astrolabe. They have arrived at a very critical time. With Mr. GUI&rsquo;s profound knowledge, they have been able to deduce several ancient characters on the jade plate. Although they have not yet understood the mystery of the astrolabe, they are obviously much better than before.</p>
<p>In this tension, GUI Li suddenly felt something in his heart. He left the astrolabe for a moment and looked around. He saw that there was nothing around him. Xiao Hui didn&rsquo;t know where to play again, or to find a place to sleep! The rest of his eyes flashed and fell on the rolled up picture beside him. He was silent for a moment. He seemed to think of something, and a faint smile appeared in the corner of his mouth.</p>
<p>However, although the smile was warm, it disappeared very quickly. He shook his head gently, as if he had left something he should not think about at the moment, and then he got into the mysterious chart.</p>
<p>In another place in the hinterland of Huqi mountain, the smoke is floating gently in the silent ice stone chamber. Biyao is still sleeping quietly, and beside her, the ghost king is sitting quietly.</p>
<p>Gray hair fell from the ghost King&rsquo;s head, reminding him that he was old, and the sleeping people beside him made him feel more heartache. In such a late night, he was as sleepless as countless nights in this decade.</p>
<p>He waited quietly, waiting for the dawn, waiting for tomorrow, perhaps, to tomorrow, really everything will change!</p>
<p>His hand, unconsciously clenched, clutching his fist.</p>
<p>Thousands of miles away, the same lonely and silent night.</p>
<p>On the high bamboo peak of Qingyun Mountain, the night wind is howling and the bamboo waves are blowing. Lu Xueqi slowly sits up from her bed. She couldn&rsquo;t sleep that night.</p>
<p>Tossing and turning, for whom?</p>
<p>She gently got out of bed without shoes, so she walked on the ground with her soft white feet, and a chill came from the soles of her feet. The ground was as cool as water. She went to the window, reached out and opened the window. The stars in the sky flowed like water waves, and immediately poured in, which added some radiance to her beautiful face.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi was still, gazing at the stars in the sky.</p>
<p>In such a late night, people in the distance are also under the starlight?</p>
<p>That light starlight, have the same sprinkle on his body?</p>
<p>She gazed quietly at the stars, never moving again, as if she were looking forward to something.</p>
<p>Stars light, but as if eternal, to see the vicissitudes of life, see through the gratitude and resentment.</p>
<p>Maybe tomorrow will be ok</p>
<p>In her heart, she thought so quietly.</p>
<p>What will happen tomorrow?</p>
<p>No one will know. (to be continued. )</p>
