      <p>There was silence all around, as if the only sound echoed in my ears was my own fierce heartbeat, and the fear of the unknown death was like endless cold water, drowning the wild dog.</p>
<p>He couldn&rsquo;t help shivering</p>
<p>Countless pairs of eyes staring at the figure, it is very poor and lonely, but he accidentally insisted, shaking hands holding the black heart, still very tight, very tight.</p>
<p>This appearance suddenly had some familiarity, as if many years ago, that stubborn and stoic young man had inexplicable persistence.</p>
<p>The red light in the eyes faded quietly, and the arms swung silently in the dark. Suddenly, countless people in black were like the tide, surging outward, and disappeared cleanly in a twinkling of an eye.</p>
<p>The wild dog&rsquo;s breathing slowly calmed down. He was a little strange, but still afraid. He slowly opened his eyes and saw this place. I don&rsquo;t know when to start, but there were only two people including him.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know when the smell of blood in the air disappeared.</p>
<p>The man, with his back to him, stood in the front of the dead soul abyss and looked down silently, as if in the deepest darkness in the world, there were memories of his past.</p>
<p>There is a wind, blowing gently, people&rsquo;s small body against this huge dead soul abyss, is very fragile. Suddenly, a thought flashed through the wild dog&rsquo;s heart, and he pushed him down while no one was there</p>
<p>Once the thought came into being, it immediately lingered in his mind like a fire. His whole body was hot and eager to try. However, his mind was so frenzied that his body seemed to resist his will and remained motionless.</p>
<p>Until the man turned around and looked at him.</p>
<p>The wild dog felt that a basin of cold water had been poured from the head to the bottom of his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you just want to push me down here?&rdquo; He said it lightly, as if he were saying something irrelevant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dang!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The black heart made it slip from the wild dog and fall to the ground. The wild dog hurriedly picked it up, and his face turned a little white, but then he straightened himself up, as if to embolden himself. &ldquo;If you want to kill me, I am not afraid of you!&rdquo; he said in a loud voice</p>
<p>The man, who was called &ldquo;Gui Li&rdquo;, glanced at him lightly and said: &ldquo;I will not kill you. If you die. The blood refining hall is really the last. I&rsquo;m afraid that the old man with black heart will die in his grave. &quot; He went forward, over the wild dog, and continued, &ldquo;in the future.</p>
<p>You can follow me! &quot;</p>
<p>The wild dog was stunned, and then said in a loud voice, &ldquo;you have almost destroyed our blood refining hall, and you want me to follow you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ghost Li didn&rsquo;t pay attention to him, but walked forward, but his voice still clearly came: &ldquo;you are too low, and now if you don&rsquo;t have me, the ghost king wants to kill you first, it&rsquo;s your surrendering peers, such as the eldest one, to see you adhere to the blood refining hall. Don&rsquo;t you think they are too shameless to kill you. &quot;</p>
<p>The wild dog was dumb, and sweat came out of his forehead. But he saw that the figure gradually disappeared into the darkness, and walked farther and farther. Finally, he stamped his foot and ran quickly to follow him, saying loudly: &ldquo;hum, I&rsquo;m not afraid of death, but in order to revive the blood training hall. I just wronged myself&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>In the dark, they walk in the ancient cave of ten thousand bats. Suddenly, as if suddenly thought of something, the person behind said: &ldquo;Hey, Zhang Xiaofan, why do you do this to me&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>His voice suddenly disappeared, deep in the darkness. All of a sudden, if there is a roar of monsters, the thick smell of blood immediately surrounded. The wild dog shuddered.</p>
<p>For a long time, the breath faded away slowly. The man in front was silent for a long time in the dark, and then said lightly: &ldquo;this name, I have forgotten for many years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wild dog took a long breath, but he couldn&rsquo;t help saying, &ldquo;what shall I call you later?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no answer. The man went forward again. The wild dog muttered a few words. I don&rsquo;t know if he was swearing, but he followed him.</p>
<p>In front of them, there is still endless darkness.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Qingyunshan.</p>
<p>This magical and mysterious mountain in the eyes of the world, ten years later, is still like a fairyland on earth.</p>
<p>The damage caused by the fight between the demons has already been repaired. I just don&rsquo;t know that the wound left in my heart has healed?</p>
<p>Ten years ago, in the first World War, the first shangzhengliang Taoist of Chaoyang peak and the first Tianyun Taoist of Luoxia peak died. The first Cangsong Taoist of Longshou peak defected. Apart from the leader daoxuan, the six heads went to half, which is said to be a great loss of vitality.</p>
<p>Today, both Chaoyang peak and Luoxia peak have been taken over as the first place by the elders of our school, only the dragon head peak. Because of Taoist Cangsong, the second largest vein, which was originally next to changmen, can not be held up in Qingyun gate. However, after the internal promotion of this vein, it is unexpected that Qi Hao, a young generation, took over the first place.</p>
<p>As if it were a trend, there are more and more opportunities for the young generation in the major factions of Qingyun gate, such as Zeng Shushu, song Daren of Dazhu peak, Wen Min of Xiaozhu peak and Lu Xueqi, who have done more and more things for their teachers.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in changmen. Over the years, immortal daoxuan has gradually left his daily chores to the proud disciple Xiao Yicai to deal with.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Tongtian mountain, ancestral hall.</p>
<p>The soft sunshine shines on the lofty palace, which is solemn and mysterious. The ancestral hall is still dark. Those long lights and little candles still offer sacrifices to the souls of countless ancestors of Qingyun gate.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu is sitting alone in the open space in front of the ancestral hall, with his eyes closed. The Dragon cutting sword, which exudes green light, floats gently on his head, sending out a green circle of light to cover him. Under the sun, there is a mysterious light.</p>
<p>His face, has disappeared the original innocence, more perseverance and vicissitudes.</p>
<p>Behind him, in the shadow of the ancestral hall, there are two eyes, staring at him quietly. For a while, a figure came out slowly.</p>
<p>It was the mysterious old man with wrinkled face. He walked out of the shadow slowly and sat down on the steps of the ancestral hall. His eyes rested on Lin Jingyu. After a long time, he said lightly, &ldquo;OK.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The green light of the Dragon cutting sword answered. Lin Jingyu took a deep breath, opened his eyes, stood up, turned his head to look at the old man, smiled and said: &ldquo;senior!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man looked at his young face with a smile on the corner of his mouth and said, &ldquo;your qualifications are really good, and you work so hard. It&rsquo;s much better than I expected. &quot;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu&rsquo;s face flashed with gratitude. He bent down deeply and said in a low voice, &ldquo;I will never forget your kindness and virtue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man waved gently. Then he sighed: &ldquo;in an instant, it&rsquo;s another decade. I have nothing to teach you, and you have been with me in this ancestral hall for ten years. Today, you can go back. &quot;</p>
<p>Lin startled Yu&rsquo;s body, showing a startled color. The old man ignored him and said, &ldquo;do you know what happened in the dragon head peak?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu returned to his mind and nodded: &ldquo;yes, some days ago, senior brother Qi Hao came here to visit me and said something to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man nodded and said: &ldquo;today I heard that the new generation of outstanding disciples in Qingyun gate are all gathered on Tongtian peak. What may happen.</p>
<p>There was a message just now from changmen. You can go there, too. &quot;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu looks at the old man with a smile. He seems to have a faint gloom on his face, but then it disappears. He waves and says, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t have to do this gesture, go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu inhales deeply. One Ju to the ground, said: &ldquo;senior, the grace of this decade, towering as a mountain. I am deeply impressed. In the future, I will learn with my whole body. I will uphold justice and eliminate demons. I will return to my school and live up to my ambition! &quot;</p>
<p>The old man nodded with a smile and said, &ldquo;OK. You go. &quot;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu made another salute, looked at the surrounding scenery, and finally turned around, straightened his body, strode forward and left the ancestral hall.</p>
<p>The sun shone on his back, as if it were dazzling.</p>
<p>Looking at his figure, the old man was stunned. He did not know when another figure appeared behind him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone.&rdquo; The figure is light and authentic.</p>
<p>The old man&rsquo;s mouth moved, slowly stood up, turned his head and looked at the man, the supreme leader in Qingyun sect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you very much.&rdquo; He said all of a sudden.</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan seemed to be slightly surprised, and frowned, &ldquo;what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man walked through his body to the ancestral hall and said, &ldquo;thank you for agreeing to let this young man accompany me for ten years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a moment&rsquo;s silence, immortal daoxuan also slowly walked into the ancestral hall. In the middle of the hall, in front of the platform where countless ancestral places of Qingyun were enshrined, the lights and candles were burning, and the faces of the people illuminated were dark.</p>
<p>Before the old man came to the altar, he picked up a brand-new candle from the incense table in front of the altar, lit it on the other candle, and replaced the next one that was about to burn out.</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan silently watched his slow and skillful movements, and suddenly said, &ldquo;I took a big risk and saved you without telling your teachers, but you didn&rsquo;t even thank me. Why do you thank me for being a teenager today? &quot;</p>
<p>The old man did not speak. He stepped back and was in the shadow, holding the candle he had just replaced. He raised his head and looked up. The ancestral throne of Qingyun gate stood in front of him. It was holy and solemn, like a mountain, as if he was easily overwhelmed by a small man.</p>
<p>He was silent. He didn&rsquo;t talk. He just stared.</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan is behind him. He can&rsquo;t see the old man&rsquo;s eyes at the moment, but he can see that the burning candle oil on the residual candle, drop by drop, falls on the dry palm, and then slowly solidifies.</p>
<p>The palm of the hand seemed to tremble.</p>
<p>Deep in the shadow, far away, as if a faint sigh came</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>When Lin Jingyu arrived at the Yuqing Hall of Tongtian peak, there were already a dozen people standing here. Among these people, some are familiar to him, others are unfamiliar to him. They only know that they are from the same family.</p>
<p>But without exception, everyone here knows that the young people standing here are all the leaders of the young generation of Qingyun gate.</p>
<p>Among the crowd, the most outstanding are two people, one is Lu Xueqi, who is naturally cold and bright, the other is Qi Hao, who is now wearing his first dress and has extraordinary bearing. In other words, the head of all the other veins did not come. Qi Hao was also the only six vein head who was present.</p>
<p>Qihao glanced around and saw Lin Jingyu coming in. He was stunned. Then he went up with a laugh. He hugged Lin Jingyu and looked at him up and down. He said with a smile, &ldquo;brother Lin, you are not in the ancestral hall. Why are you here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the past ten years, Lin Jingyu has been living in the ancestral hall under the pretext of keeping the spirit, and the mysterious old man is related to a past period of Mishin in Qingyun gate, so people don&rsquo;t know. At this moment, he naturally won&rsquo;t say anything. &ldquo;Ten years later, I also came out. Someone told me to come here. I didn&rsquo;t expect that elder martial brother Qi was here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Qi Hao smiled. &ldquo;The headmaster told the outstanding young disciples of each vein to come here. He said that there was something important to discuss. I just had nothing to do, so I came here to have a look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were talking with each other when a man came by. Tall and tall, it is song Daren, the first apprentice of dazhufeng. Ten years later, he didn&rsquo;t change much.</p>
<p>At that time, song Daren and Qi Hao were also familiar with each other. At this moment, they came to greet each other for a while. After a while, his eyes fell on Lin Jingyu, and he said with a smile, &ldquo;younger martial brother Lin hasn&rsquo;t been seen for several years. He is more handsome and upright. I think he has made a lot of progress in Taoism, right</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu lowered his head slightly and said with a smile, &ldquo;elder martial brother song, you are flattered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Song Daren wanted to say something more, a voice came from behind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, elder martial brother Qi, do you know my younger brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Qi Hao looked at the speaker and said with a smile, &ldquo;I have forgotten that no one can forget you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Zeng Shushu, the most outstanding disciple of fenghuifeng&rsquo;s young generation, who comes here together with Wenmin and Lu Xueqi, two beauties from xiaozhufeng.</p>
<p>Most people&rsquo;s eyes are looking at the cold Lu Xueqi. Only song Daren looks at Wen min. ha ha, Wen Min smiles. A look at him.</p>
<p>Qi Hao and others also met with Wen Min and Lu Xueqi, who wrote: &ldquo;elder martial brother Qi, when you took the first place, my younger brother made a mistake. It&rsquo;s forbidden by my father&rsquo;s circle. Don&rsquo;t blame me for not coming to congratulate me! &quot;</p>
<p>Qihao laughed and said, &ldquo;where did younger martial brother Zeng say, if you want to, you can do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu smiled and nodded, then looked around. &ldquo;Elder martial brother Qi, we are called by the headmaster this time. I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s the big deal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Qi Hao waved his hand and said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know exactly, but I heard something happened somewhere in the West. The headmaster wants to send a young generation of excellent disciples to practice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah.&rdquo; All the people around made a sound. Many people were curious and excited. Zeng Shushu used to be full of smiles, but suddenly her face turned into a congealed one, as if she thought of something. Qi Hao was surprised and said, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s wrong with Zeng Shidi?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu smiled bitterly and said: &ldquo;young generation, outstanding disciples come down the mountain to experience?&rdquo; He shook his head and sighed, &ldquo;how can I hear that so well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He and Qi Hao looked at each other and suddenly understood each other&rsquo;s intentions. The four people in those days now</p>
<p>They all turned around and looked at the beautiful woman. Lu Xueqi stood there quietly, as if she had not heard anything, or buried everything in her heart. The bright eyes turned and looked at Lin Jingyu. It seemed that they wanted to see something, but at last, they moved away.</p>
<p>At this time, suddenly, the sound of bells and tripods sounded on the main hall, and everyone stood up immediately. A moment later, the leader, immortal Dao Xuan, accompanied by Xiao Yicai, came out, looked at everyone, smiled and said hello, and sat down on the throne.</p>
<p>When they all saluted together, Qi Hao stood at the front, and immortal daoxuan waved with a smile and said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s it. Just sit down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But among all the disciples, except for Qi Hao&rsquo;s different identity now, he sat down for the first time under immortal daoxuan, and others stood.</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan glanced at Xiao Yicai and said, &ldquo;Yicai, come on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai nodded and said, &ldquo;yes, master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he said, he came out and looked at the people around him. He said in a loud voice, &ldquo;everyone, please come here today. There is one thing that needs to be done by the best disciples of Qingyun sect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he said that, the crowd suddenly stirred, and Xiao Yicai smiled, and continued: &ldquo;recently, there are rumors all over the world that in the Western Everglades, there is a strange light rising to the sky in recent days, which lasts for several days, for fear that a strange treasure will be born. Originally, the spirit of heaven came to us, only the virtuous lived in it, and we have no interest in it. But after the news was spread, it was said that the evil spirits of the demon sect were marching westward, intending to infect them. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hateful!&rdquo; All the young disciples of Qingyun sect were angry and shouted one after another.</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai treated the crowd with a little lower voice and smiled: &ldquo;if the news is false, it&rsquo;s all right. But if there are really treasures, if they fall into the hands of the devil cult, it&rsquo;s not for the tiger. Qingyun sect has always been the leader of the world&rsquo;s righteous way. Therefore, the real leader decided to select outstanding disciples from the younger generation of his sect to go to the Western Everglades together, uphold justice and morality, and cut off demons and demons. &quot;</p>
<p>Speaking of this, he paused for a moment, then suddenly took some mysterious taste and said: &ldquo;you guys, there is another important point. It&rsquo;s said that today Tianyin temple and burning incense valley also sent their disciples to the Western Everglades. Since that war ten years ago, it has been clear to everyone that the two factions are obviously in harmony with us, but they have been secretly peering at the position of the leader of the right way for a long time. I hope you don&rsquo;t lose your face! &quot;</p>
<p>There was a lot of noise in the crowd, and someone called out: &ldquo;don&rsquo;t worry, leader, we will never lose the face of Qingyun gate!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly, this time we must show our strength to the demons and the people in the burning incense valley of Tianyin temple!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan smiled and nodded, stood up, and said, &ldquo;this time to the west, it may be dangerous. The people in the demon sect are even more dangerous and cunning. You should worry about it on a regular basis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; they all said</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan said to Xiaoyi, &ldquo;then you can arrange to leave early.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that, he looked at Lin Jingyu, who was standing in the crowd, intentionally or unconsciously. Then he turned around and went to the inner hall. Everyone gave him a good send. When his figure disappeared, Xiao Yi turned back to divide the staff.</p>
<p>In that side, Lin Jingyu said to Qi Hao, &ldquo;why, elder martial brother Qi, are you not going this time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Qi Hao said with a smile, &ldquo;younger martial brother Lin, I can&rsquo;t leave now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu woke up, blushed, and said, &ldquo;ah, elder martial brother, you are the first in your family, but I didn&rsquo;t think of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Qi Hao patted him on the shoulder and said with a smile, &ldquo;this is your first time to walk around the world. It&rsquo;s a great opportunity. I&rsquo;m looking forward to your great show and fame!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu said with a smile, &ldquo;elder martial brother, you are joking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Qi Hao smiled, but then his face was a little gloomy. Looking at nobody around, he whispered to Lin Jingyu, &ldquo;brother Lin, to tell you the truth, Shifu ten years ago Taoist Cangsong betrayed Qingyun. As a result, we could not hold our head up. Especially, the disciples of Chaoyang peak and luoxiafeng were like enemies when they saw us. Elder martial brother, I&rsquo;m the first one, and I&rsquo;ve done a lot of hard work, so I&rsquo;m looking forward to your going out this time to help us fight for a breath! &quot;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu was silent. After a moment, he nodded slightly and said in a low voice, &ldquo;elder martial brother Qi, I know that you can rest assured that I will not let you down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Qi Hao smiled a little, and his face relaxed a little. He reached out and patted Lin Jingyu on the shoulder.</p>
<p>Just at this time song Daren came over, looked at them and said with a smile, &ldquo;why, this time is junior brother Lin going out of longshoufeng?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Qi Hao said with a smile, &ldquo;exactly, I don&rsquo;t know who&rsquo;s in Dazhu peak?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren laughed and said, &ldquo;I was still a great elder martial brother, but later my elder martial mother thought I was stupid and let my sixth younger martial brother, Du Bishu, go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Qi Hao said with a smile, &ldquo;younger martial brother Du has always been smart. With him in our Qingyun gate, he has become even more powerful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren&rsquo;s eloquence is naturally not as smooth and thoughtful as Qi Hao&rsquo;s. He laughs a few words at the moment and is about to leave. Then he turns around and says to Qi Hao, &ldquo;by the way, elder martial brother Qi, my elder martial mother has missed my younger martial sister ling&rsquo;er recently. After you go back, ask her to go back to dazhufeng and stay for a few days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Qi Hao said with a smile: &ldquo;elder martial brother song, you don&rsquo;t know. This morning, before I left longshoufeng, ling&rsquo;er had already gone back to dazhufeng, saying that he missed his mother. It seems that mother-in-law and she are really close to each other. &quot;</p>
<p>Song Daren was stunned for a moment, then he laughed, his voice was clear, and echoed in the Yuqing hall. (to be continued. )</p>
