      <p>The southern border area is quite different from the customs of China and Turkey. It is only for many years. Although it is located in a remote place, it still has exchanges with China and Turkey. And the fur, ore and other specialties produced in the south of Xinjiang have always had a good reputation in the Central Plains, attracting many Chinese and Turkish businessmen to trade.</p>
<p>Over time, the Inns that had not existed in southern Xinjiang also appeared in the most bustling towns under the influence of the Chinese and Turkish merchants.</p>
<p>Guili and Xiaobai are now in such an inn, whose name is directly local, &ldquo;Tianshui inn&rdquo;.</p>
<p>When entering the inn, it is obvious that the table and chair furnishings are influenced by the Chinese culture. However, both the boss and the waiter are local Zhuang people. In the south of Xinjiang, the Zhuang nationality has the largest population, relatively rich life, the most affected by the middle soil, no less than other ethnic groups still adhere to the life of hunting, and the Zhuang nationality has gradually started farming and business.</p>
<p>But in spite of this, the Zhuang people are relatively peaceful. Most of them lack that fierce spirit, so they are not as powerful as the Miao people whose population is less than them.</p>
<p>Guili and Xiaobai sat down and had a waiter come to receive them. At this time, it was getting dark, but there were not many guests in the inn. Looking at the appearance and clothes, this fellow is also a person of the Zhuang Nationality in southern Xinjiang. Most of them have been working here for some time, but he speaks fluently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would you like to eat, my guest? We have clean rooms here. The price is the most reasonable and famous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ghost Li nodded and said:&rdquo; leave us two clean houses, we live one night</p>
<p>The waiter smiled and nodded, and then said: &ldquo;two guests, I think I haven&rsquo;t eaten yet. Can I order something?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was not hungry, but after looking at Xiaobai, he decided to have something to eat and said, &ldquo;well, you can bring us two bowls of rice and some more&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Er!&rdquo; Sitting aside, Xiaobai suddenly opens her mouth. With a smile on his face, he said: &ldquo;do you have the&rdquo; earth stuffy yellow sparrow &quot;</p>
<p>Ghost Li a Zheng, look to small white, that fellow is also a stay. I couldn&rsquo;t help but take a look at Xiaobai and say, &ldquo;girl, have you ever come to our South Xinjiang? We have this brand dish naturally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The smile on Xiaobai&rsquo;s face was stronger and his eyes flashed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like remembering something and slowly saying, &ldquo;Oh, by the way, there are three sections of snake intestines, roasted bear tail, roasted autumn leaves, five little insects.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blackheart &ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her eyes twinkled, and she thought as she spoke, the start speed was still relatively slow. She said one dish name by one, but later on, the faster she said it, the more bizarre the dish name was. It was amazing. It&rsquo;s not in the middle of the earth.</p>
<p>In the shop, not only the guy&rsquo;s smile turned into an awkward expression with big mouth, but also the shopkeeper who calculated accounts in the distance could not help coming.</p>
<p>Xiaobai said about 30 dishes in one breath, then stopped for a rest, turned to the boss and the waiter and said with a smile: &ldquo;these dishes, do you have any here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boss and the waiter looked at each other. After a while, the boss smiled and said: &ldquo;you are really knowledgeable, girl. All the dishes you just mentioned are famous in the special products of Southern Xinjiang. It&rsquo;s just that there are many materials that are not easy to find. In addition to the stuffy yellow Finch, we only have black heart fruit and roasted bear tail. I&rsquo;m sorry. &quot;</p>
<p>Xiaobai could not help showing a look of regret, but then he said with a smile, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s cook these three dishes first!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boss and the waiter agreed in a hurry. I&rsquo;m busy. Xiaobai Mei looks around, but sees the ghost and Li is looking at himself. She smiles and says: &ldquo;for hundreds of years, I don&rsquo;t know why. Suddenly, I want to taste the flavor of those years. You&rsquo;ve been here. Have you ever eaten these dishes? &quot;</p>
<p>GUI Li shook his head. In the past, when he came to the south of Xinjiang, he was full of worries about finding the black sorcerer to cure Biyao. How to take these desires into consideration? He usually dealt with them in the wild. This time, if it&rsquo;s not a special case, we need to avoid the pursuers all over the burning incense valley. After all, Xiaobai is a woman. It&rsquo;s not good to sleep in the wild mountains and mountains at night, so we entered the town.</p>
<p>He was silent for a moment, and suddenly he asked, &ldquo;I can probably guess what is blackheart fruit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaobai said with a smile, &ldquo;this is the unique fruit of Southern Xinjiang. It looks green and tender, but its heart is black. Fried in an oil pan, it tastes delicious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ghost Li frowned and said: &ldquo;that way&rdquo; roasted bear tail &ldquo;. What is it? Is it the tail of black bear? I&rsquo;ve heard of bear&rsquo;s paw and bear&rsquo;s gall in the past, but I haven&rsquo;t heard that bear&rsquo;s tail can also be put into the dish? &quot;</p>
<p>Xiaobai said with a smile, &ldquo;this bear is not another bear. It&rsquo;s a unique animal in southern Xinjiang. It&rsquo;s called&rdquo; long tailed bear &ldquo;. It&rsquo;s far smaller than the black bear and white bear we know, but it&rsquo;s far more delicious than they can compare. In particular, a long tail is the essence. It is famous in southern Xinjiang.</p>
<p>GUI Li is silent. Xiaobai looks at him and suddenly says, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s strange that you don&rsquo;t care about anything in your daily life. How can you mention this dish, but have some interest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a long silence, he grew up on the bamboo peak of Qingyun Mountain. He soon began to cook. He had some talent and interest in cooking together. If you are in an ordinary family, you are afraid that he will become a cook, and most of you will be able to make a small famous family. Just now</p>
<p>With a sigh, the ghost suddenly lost interest and didn&rsquo;t want to say anything. Xiaobai looks at him with great interest, her eyes are soft, and she doesn&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s on her mind?</p>
<p>Only Xiaohui is still so restless. She looks around and shouts in a low voice. She seems to be expecting something.</p>
<p>In the dead of night, Tianshui stronghold, which has been bustling all day, gradually calms down at night.</p>
<p>There are two floors in Tianshui inn. The second floor is the guest room. GUI Li pays close attention to observation. He and Xiaobai are the only two people staying tonight. It seems that although it&rsquo;s busy here, the world is in chaos at this time. Few Chinese and Turkish businessmen come to southern Xinjiang. However, the local people in southern Xinjiang usually do not live in shops.</p>
<p>Xiaobai&rsquo;s room is next to Guili&rsquo;s room. The walls are separated by wooden boards. There is not much sound insulation effect. I can hear the slight laughter and squeak of the next room. Monkey Xiaohui runs to play with Xiaobai again. Although Xiaobai still comes back to play with Guili every night when she goes to bed, Xiaobai doesn&rsquo;t know how to do it. It seems that Xiaobai is very good with Xiaohui. Now Xiaobai likes to stick to this millennium fox.</p>
<p>Ghost Li lay in the room for a while. He didn&rsquo;t live in the inn for a long time. Instead, he was not used to it. Unconsciously after a long time, it was late at night, but he still did not sleep, the heart can not help but some upset. He stood up, walked to the window slowly, pushed open the window and looked out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s different from the day.</p>
<p>At this moment in the night sky in the south of Xinjiang, dark clouds gradually disperse. Although the clouds are still there, but from the gap, there is a trace of moonlight.</p>
<p>The moonlight is clear. Like frost and snow, it fell on him.</p>
<p>In the long world, all living beings are sleeping, and there is no one in the wild. Only in the unknown corner of the street came the low chirp of insects.</p>
<p>Darkness enveloped the earth.</p>
<p>Overlooking from the window, thousands of mountains and miles, the night sky is deep.</p>
<p>Suddenly, under such a bleak and lonely night in southern Xinjiang. The past is like a tide. It&rsquo;s all over my heart.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, the children of that remote village were immersed in the billows of the world of mortals, drifting with the waves. I look back, but it turned out that there was no one around.</p>
<p>Life is so lonely</p>
<p>Under the moon, the man bowed his head and said nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hiss!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A distant sound of breaking the sky came from afar.</p>
<p>Ghost Li looks up, his eyebrows are slightly wrinkled. There is only a light awn in the sky, like a meteor flying in the night sky, across the sky and over the sky of the Tianshui stronghold. To the West.</p>
<p>But behind it, there are three rays of light, which are hard to give up.</p>
<p>What kind of vision experience does GUI Li have now? Naturally, at a glance, he can see that these four lights are just the way for people in the cultivation to keep out of the sky. He can only see that these four lights are chasing back and forth in the night sky clouds, although the latter three lights can&rsquo;t catch up with the light in front all the time. But the fugitive cannot escape the chase.</p>
<p>After a while, the first light seems to have made a decision, falling from the sky. Look at the direction, it&rsquo;s in the southwest of Tianshui stronghold.</p>
<p>Then the three rays of light that were being traced also fell.</p>
<p>The ghost Li ponders for a moment, but feels uneasy tonight. He really doesn&rsquo;t want to stand here alone any more. Then, with a wave of his right hand, he quietly turns into blue light and flies to the place where the four lights fall.</p>
<p>After his figure became smaller and smaller, the window of the room next to him was opened with a squeak. Xiaobai holds Xiaohui and looks out in the direction of Guili&rsquo;s flying. After a while, Guili&rsquo;s figure disappears in the dark.</p>
<p>Xiaobai&rsquo;s face is calm, there is no expression on the white face, only the luster in his eyes, but it flashes in a different way.</p>
<p>The ghost Li flies silently all the way, and soon finds that the place where the lights and shadows fall is the old stronghold of Tianshui, which has been abandoned for many years.</p>
<p>Just as he entered the stronghold, a dull low cry came from the front, followed by an angry voice mixed with another person&rsquo;s familiar laughter.</p>
<p>GUI Li frowned at once.</p>
<p>The laughter is soft and charming, with the power of confusing people&rsquo;s mind. It&rsquo;s the voice of the Golden Vase.</p>
<p>He hesitated for a moment, hiding his body in the dark corner, and slowly swept forward.</p>
<p>Originally quiet streets, debris left tile, a bleak landscape.</p>
<p>At this time, the sky is clear, the clouds are gradually dispersed, and the moonlight is gradually bright, which makes the deserted village a little brighter.</p>
<p>Jinpinger still has a permanent smile on her face, standing in the middle of the street with a smile, facing a young man who is glaring at her. This person, however, is also what Guili knows - Li Xun, an excellent disciple of the burning incense valley.</p>
<p>On the street behind him, there was a burning incense Valley disciple who was lying on the ground. It seemed that he had just been hurt by Jin Ping&rsquo;er. His clothes began to row down from his left chest. There was a very deep and big wound, and he was powerless * *.</p>
<p>But, the fierce eyes, in these three people only turned a turn, a moment later, his eyes completely fell on the last person.</p>
<p>In the bleak night, the streets are desolate. There is a deserted building left behind jinpinger. There is a woman in white, with a long sword on her back, standing on the eaves, standing in front of the wind. Her clothes flutter slowly.</p>
<p>Snow like skin in the moonlight, even let people feel some pale color of the beautiful woman.</p>
<p>This night, this moonlight, is it because she is so beautiful and bright?</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi!</p>
<p>In the familiar bright eyes, whose shadow is reflected?</p>
<p>Ghost Li was stunned.</p>
<p>In the dark, he quietly looked at the woman as if she had come out of the world. The wind and frost of the whole world, for ten years, seemed not to have touched her at all. So let people look, the first sight, is her in the moonlight, that looks like a cold fairy general posture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goblin!&rdquo; Li Xun&rsquo;s handsome face is full of anger.</p>
<p>He and Lu Xueqi blocked the gold bottle one by one, but they just landed. The Witch of the demon sect suddenly got into trouble. She first bewitched the younger martial brother of the burning incense valley behind him with &ldquo;mind bewitching skill&rdquo;, and then hurt him with purple awn blade. If it wasn&rsquo;t for Li Xun, I&rsquo;m afraid that younger martial brother would die.</p>
<p>Just. What Li Xun is more concerned about at the moment is that in addition to the injury of this younger martial brother, there are other things: &ldquo;what did you do to my younger martial sister Yanhong, please hand her over quickly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Golden Vase smiled, but suddenly her eyes drifted.</p>
<p>Intentionally or unintentionally, he glanced at the dark place behind Li Xun, where GUI Li was hiding, and said: &ldquo;you also said that it was your younger martial sister, not my younger martial sister. How do I know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; Li Xun was very angry, obviously concerned about the younger martial sister, and said angrily: &ldquo;if it wasn&rsquo;t for the superior martial uncle&rsquo;s eyes to realize, we would still be kept in the dark by you. You killed my burning disciple on purpose. You must repay this revenge. If you know your face. Give younger martial sister Yanhong in good time! &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ouch! I&rsquo;m so scared! &quot; Jin Ping&rsquo;er clapped his heart with his hand, but his face was full of smiles. There was no sign of fear. Instead, the color of softness was a little heavier. In a soft voice, he said, &ldquo;you are still in the right way. How can many people bully me a weak woman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A cold hum came from Lu Xueqi behind.</p>
<p>Li Xun glanced at the beautiful figure standing on the high place and said to Jin Ping&rsquo;er, &ldquo;demon, you will never understand again. I&rsquo;m not welcome&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>Before the word &ldquo;gone&rdquo; was exported, the gold bottle suddenly gave a smile, and the purple awn on the bottom of the right sleeve was suddenly full.</p>
<p>Li Xun is on guard. The witch is very crafty. And the magic weapon zimang blade is so sharp that it&rsquo;s really very important. Just now, although the younger martial brother behind her was influenced by her mind bewildering skill, her years of cultivation were not her enemies. It can be seen that she has a high level of Taoism.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that Li Xun comes from pride. Self cultivation is also high, although alert, but no fear.</p>
<p>And there is a peerless beauty staring at this distance. Since he first met ten years ago, he has been in love with Lu Xueqi for a long time, and must not lose face before the beauty.</p>
<p>He was about to concentrate on fighting the enemy here, but unexpectedly, the deceitful Jin Ping&rsquo;er was just a feint move. Suddenly, he was dressed as purple awn and attacked by Lu Xueqi, who was behind renjianhe.</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, the purple awn approaches, Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s face looks like frost, and the sharp sound of &ldquo;Zheng&rdquo; is full of immortal Qi and blue light. The Heavenly Sword suddenly comes out of its sheath and lies across her chest. Li Xun looks at him behind his back, but he is in a hurry. Yu Jian chases him up.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, jinpinger zimang Linfu contacted with Tianya, but the whole person took advantage of the situation and retreated as fast as lightning, just under Li Xun. Li Xun was surprised, but he couldn&rsquo;t stop chasing back. Lu Xueqi wanted to catch up, but was blocked by Li Xun again, so he had to press down his body.</p>
<p>At the same time, they saw that the direction of jinpinger&rsquo;s flying was exactly where Li Xun was standing just now. There was also a disciple of burning incense Valley who was injured and fell to the ground and was panicked. Li Xun was shocked. Just now, he wanted to show himself in front of Lu Xueqi. He forgot that his younger martial brother behind him has no resistance at the moment. At the moment, he regrets very much, roars loudly, looks like electricity, and chases back with all his strength.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi also follows behind him and chases Jin pinger.</p>
<p>In a twinkling of an eye, jinpinger has come to the disciple of the burning incense valley. Suddenly, he takes a pick on the tip of his foot and kicks the whole person back. Li Xun catches him in a hurry. Unexpectedly, his touch is blood. In a twinkling of an eye, his clothes and robes are dyed red.</p>
<p>Jin Ping&rsquo;er has already killed the young disciple.</p>
<p>If Li Xun&rsquo;s eyes are about to burst out with fire, Lu Xueqi has already crossed his body and chased Jin pinger. And the golden bottle is just passing the dark corner.</p>
<p>Low, in such a moment, the voice of the Golden Vase son quietly and quickly came: &ldquo;help me to block that woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the dark place, the man snorted. His disdain was obvious, and his body was ready to move. He obviously didn&rsquo;t want to participate in it.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, in the moment of the lightning, the gold bottle suddenly said three words: &ldquo;seven Li Dong!&rdquo;</p>
<p>These three words, like lightning, beat down the body that is about to fly. The face in jinpinger&rsquo;s eyes was full of mysterious smile, which swept away from him in an instant.</p>
<p>And a moment later, Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s white figure, tracking and coming, is in front of her.</p>
<p>Who knows, in that moment, whose figure flashed in my mind?</p>
<p>When the blue light rose, Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s face, which had been cold and frosty, was moved, confused, delighted and angry!</p>
<p>Cheung</p>
<p>Tianya and blood eating, blue and red light, in the night, reflect each other, far away floating away.</p>
<p>Li Xun passes by Lu Xueqi and follows Jin pinger. After all, Jin Pinger is the more important object, especially after she killed the younger martial brother who came from the same way. But, others in the middle of the sky, quietly look back, looking at the deserted street on the silent confrontation between a man and a woman, the flame flashed deep in the eye, but it was so hot.</p>
<p>In the distance, the laughter of Jin Ping&rsquo;er came from afar. The voice was soft with a little banter, and the ghost listened to it silently.</p>
<p>Moonlight, like water, sprinkles on this desolate hill, lonely street.</p>
<p>A woman in front of her body, white as snow, with a long sword in her hand, as bright as autumn water.</p>
<p>In the bright eyes, who is the one who looks deeply?</p>
<p>Note 1: qilidong, the largest settlement of Miao people in history, is named because it is said to be as wide as qilidong. When the development was impossible to test, it was destroyed by the encirclement and suppression of the officers and men at the end of the Yuan Dynasty and the beginning of the Ming Dynasty. It is said that this place is easy to defend and hard to attack. There is only a narrow channel connecting the outer Road, which has always been the spiritual pillar of the Miao people&rsquo;s world.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s hard to verify the specific address, but it seems that in 1983, a &ldquo;Daping township&rdquo; was found in Heyang, Guangxi. The surrounding terrain is very similar, and it is led by the Miao people. There is a &ldquo;dog God cave&rdquo; near the mountain top, and there is a dog God like boulder worshiped by the Miao people. It&rsquo;s suspected that it should be here.</p>
<p>Another note: the God of dog, the legend of Miao people, the officers and soldiers broke in late at night, and all Miao people slept. A stone dog suddenly barked at the top of the mountain, alerting the people, so they fought together to save the whole family. Since then, the dog God has been consecrated, and the fragrance and fire are constantly burning. (to be continued. )</p>
