      <p>The plain courtyard is just like the one outside. It is simply a room against the mountain wall. The middle path is paved with green bricks and leads to the door. There are grass on both sides. It seems that no one has taken care of it seriously. Weeds have grown in many places.</p>
<p>Different from the outside, there is a heavy black curtain hanging on the door of this room. Besides this door, there seems to be no other windows or other exits.</p>
<p>Ghost Li looked at this ordinary and ordinary hut, a burst of thirst in his throat, but his hands were involuntarily clenched. He looked at the master Puhong, but he could see that there was a very complicated look on his face, which was like regret, pain, and indescribable. He was also looking at the small door, in a daze.</p>
<p>For a time, there was no one to speak. In the silence, there was only a low chirp of insects in the weeds beside me. I didn&rsquo;t know what was calling.</p>
<p>For a long time, master Pu Hong sighed softly and said, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The muscles on his face twitched and whispered, &ldquo;OK.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong slowly stepped forward, stretched out his hand, opened the curtain, and pushed the door open with a squeak.</p>
<p>The faint sound came from the rotor on the door. I don&rsquo;t know how many days no one opened the door. It was heavy and desolate.</p>
<p>A cold air suddenly rushed out of the house. Although the ghost was still standing outside the door, he was shocked by the cold air and shivered with his practice. In this small room, it seems to be the coldest place in the world.</p>
<p>GUI Li frowned and hesitated. At this moment, the voice of master Pu Hong came from behind the curtain and said, &ldquo;come in, little benefactor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took a deep breath, shook his head, stretched out his hand to open the curtain and stepped in.</p>
<p>The curtain fell slowly, and the door creaked again. Close it gently.</p>
<p>In the small courtyard, once again calm, the figure of FA Xiang came slowly from the front and looked at the flat and unadorned cottage. The Buddha was gently chanted in his mouth, but he bowed down and worshipped. His face was solemn and solemn.</p>
<p>The curtain was down and the wooden door closed because there were no windows. The room was in darkness.</p>
<p>The chilling chill came from all directions in an instant, as if countless cold steel needles were going to pierce into the skin.</p>
<p>At the beginning of his serious illness, he had a few cold wars. However, he was not a mortal after all. He gradually got used to it after all. Although the cold can not enter the body, but that piercing cold, still very uncomfortable.</p>
<p>This hut on Xumi mountain. It seems to be colder than that of the Arctic ice field.</p>
<p>GUI Li was stunned. When he was in doubt, he only heard a low sigh from the crowd in front of him and said, &ldquo;younger martial brother, we&rsquo;ve come to see you. This man, you&rsquo;ve wanted to see for a long time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His voice was deep and strange, and the chill in the room was suddenly a little bit colder, almost freezing human blood into ice.</p>
<p>Then, a glimmer of light. White with a slight silver light, slowly from the front of the people and ghosts, the end of the hut, lit up.</p>
<p>The light was as light as snow. First, a wisp of bloom, and then at the edge of the light slowly lit up another silver shimmer, but also close to it, integrated, and then one by one glimmer of light successively lit up, gradually see. It&rsquo;s a disc shape about one foot square.</p>
<p>The light was soft, pure white as snow. The light could not rise more than a foot high. At the end, it seemed to turn into snowflakes and white fireflies. It danced gently and fell slowly, like a dream.</p>
<p>Then, the continuous light, slowly merging, gradually bright, ghost and Pu Hong only heard a light roar rising in the room, the clear voice was pleasant, the white light was great, and the instant light was shining, illuminating the whole room.</p>
<p>It seemed that the heart of the Buddha stopped for a moment, even the heart of the Buddha stopped.</p>
<p>He just stood there like a stiff icicle, staring into the deep light. There was no other thought in his mind, only two words echoed</p>
<p>Puzhi!</p>
<p>The light is like snow, brilliant flow, from a disc of pure white as jade, and at the same time, it is cold. On that square disc, there was a man sitting on it. It was the man who changed Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s life and made today&rsquo;s ghostly and unforgettable person Puzhi.</p>
<p>From a distance, Puzhi&rsquo;s face is lifelike. Although the skin looks pale and has no trace of vitality, it does not show any signs of dryness after careful observation.</p>
<p>Even, he was still the compassionate and peaceful old monk in Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s memory. There was no change at all, but there was a faint pain between his looks.</p>
<p>Except for the body.</p>
<p>Puzhi&rsquo;s body, somehow, was twice as small as the original. It was because of this that he sat on the pure white jade plate. He wanted to come to the room with cold air, but he didn&rsquo;t see any ice piled up. Most of the reason lies in this exotic treasure. Of course, Puzhi&rsquo;s remains can be kept for such a long time, mostly because of this exotic treasure.</p>
<p>However, he could not think of so many more in his mind. The monk sitting on the jade plate was clearly engraved in the bottom of his heart. For more than ten years, he did not forget.</p>
<p>Hate, right?</p>
<p>Is that right?</p>
<p>Sometimes his mind was empty, sometimes like a storm, thunder and lightning roaring, all kinds of pain, all kinds of gratitude and resentment, but for a moment they all spread to his heart!</p>
<p>That kind monk saved his life and taught him how to treat him like a son. But it was this seemingly merciful monk who ruined his life and made him suffer day and night, like falling into the abyss of hell</p>
<p>Gratitude and resentment, originally thought only in the heart, but now today, actually saw his face.</p>
<p>Some of them couldn&rsquo;t stand, dizzy, and fell to the side. At this time, a gentle and warm hand reached out from the side and held him. At the same time, a familiar breath was the Buddhist Dharma mahabhabhabhabhabhabhabhabhabhabhabhabhadra, which came from the palm of that hand. It was so thick that it slowly subdued the blood of the ferocious heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amitabha, little benefactor, don&rsquo;t be too excited. Take care of yourself.&rdquo; The peaceful voice of master Pu Hong. It&rsquo;s coming from the side.</p>
<p>GUI Li such as awakened from the dream, a bite teeth, deep breath, let go of Pu Hong&rsquo;s hand. He stood up straight again. However, his eyes never left Puzhi&rsquo;s face. In the dim light, Pu Zhixiang and his face. The look of pain seemed more profound.</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong looked at GUI Li carefully. In his eyes, the young man&rsquo;s painful and changeable face was changing in the dim light. At this moment, GUI Li was no longer the famous demon demon, but just a miserable mortal in his eyes, just like the young man many years ago.</p>
<p>He sighed softly.</p>
<p>His eyes were heavy, he turned his head and looked forward to Puzhi. He slowly stepped forward, gazed at Puzhi&rsquo;s face, and whispered: &ldquo;younger martial brother, your last wish in your life has been done by the elder martial brother. The elder martial brother is incompetent and could not save you at that time. Evil results from evil, but self debt needs to be tasted. You said it yourself. May you lay down your sin and be reborn as soon as possible. Amitabha! &quot;</p>
<p>He closed his arms, saluted Puzhi&rsquo;s body, and then went straight out. At the moment when he was about to go out, he said, &ldquo;little benefactor, I think you want to stay alone with younger martial brother Puzhi! I&rsquo;m in the meditation room in front of me. If you need anything, come and see me. &quot;</p>
<p>GUI Li didn&rsquo;t speak and seemed to be deaf. At the moment, only the Puzhi monk in the dim light was in his eyes.</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong sighed, opened the door, lifted the curtain, and went out. There was silence in the room.</p>
<p>Ghouli slowly, slowly moving steps, bit by bit to the wisdom of the past.</p>
<p>He seems to be afraid of something, some do not know what to do, clearly he had that kind of toothache, but for what, at this time, his heart was filled with infinite sorrow.</p>
<p>The man, sitting there quietly, without any anger, seemed to have been waiting for something. Even on his face with pain, it seemed that there was more desire and expectation.</p>
<p>GUI Li slowly walked to him, staring at Puzhi, his hands slowly clenched, and his nails were deeply embedded in his flesh, but finally he was released.</p>
<p>He seemed to have lost his dependence and was powerless, so he fell and sat quietly on the ground, sitting in front of Puzhi, without saying a word.</p>
<p>Shimmer, shining on Puzhi and him, the two figures!</p>
<p>Time, in this room, pause, sometimes flow back, sometimes jump, but after all, what kind of hearts do not change?</p>
<p>Even if one is still beating, one is silent!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dong Dong Dong Dong&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>The morning bell, once again, reverberates in every corner of Xumi mountain. It makes people wake up from their dreams, but it has a taste that can take people away from the ordinary world.</p>
<p>At the top of Xumi mountain, outside the quiet Buddhist temple, there was a knock on the door.</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong raised his eyebrows, then shook his head slightly and sighed, &ldquo;is it Dharma Prime Minister? Come in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dharma came in and saluted master Puhong. Looking at his face, he seemed to have a trace of worry and said, &ldquo;master, it has been a whole day and a night. Benefactor Zhang has not come out yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong shook his head and said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not easy to see the evil fate of the whole world. It&rsquo;s not easy to let go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a low voice, &ldquo;yes.&rdquo; Then he frowned and said to Pu Hong, &ldquo;master, I&rsquo;m worried that there is a&rdquo; jade ice plate &ldquo;in the hut. Although it can protect the immortal Dharma body of martial uncle Puzhi, it is extremely harmful to ordinary people. What&rsquo;s more, benefactor Zhang has just recovered from serious injury. He is in a state of confusion and pain. In case something happens How can we cope with Uncle Puzhi&rsquo;s dying confession? &quot;</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong said, &ldquo;it doesn&rsquo;t matter. I protected his heart with Mahayana Prajna yesterday. In addition to his own practice, though the cold is poisonous, I don&rsquo;t think it will be a big problem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After hearing this, FA Xiang was relieved and joined the ten ways: &ldquo;so it is. The disciple is relieved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong nodded and looked at the Dharma at the same time and said, &ldquo;I think you are very concerned about this benefactor Zhang. Although your uncle Puzhi confessed on his deathbed that day, you seem to have a different eye on him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>FA Xiang said with a smile, &ldquo;master, it&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he said this, he seemed to recall the past and sighed: &ldquo;to tell you the truth, it has been ten years since we first met with benefactor Zhang. In the past ten years, my disciples have made some progress in Buddhism and Taoism, but they have been like babies in their life, with little change. Only this benefactor Zhang had a rough life. Ups and downs, great sorrow, resentment, hatred, Buddha said all kinds of pain. He tried them all. &quot;</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong moved a little and said a word of Buddha&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p>The Dharma minister also said, &ldquo;when I was still awake at night, I thought of this benefactor Zhang and used his body to replace him. Imagine all the pain that happened to the disciple. It&rsquo;s a pity that my disciple&rsquo;s Buddhism is not deep after all. It&rsquo;s fear. Buddha said that the skin of the body is nothing more than dust, but one of the ways of heart is to realize. When I think about this place, I think of the ups and downs of benefactor Zhang&rsquo;s life. I really admire him for his hard support. &quot;</p>
<p>At this point, FA Xiang suddenly changed his face, but he knelt down to master Pu Hong.</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong was stunned and said, &ldquo;what are you doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Dharma minister said in a low voice, &ldquo;master is on the top. The disciple&rsquo;s practice is shallow and he doesn&rsquo;t have a deep understanding of Buddhism. However, he is really intolerable to people like benefactor Zhang who are suffering from evil spirits. I hope that your teacher can use the boundless magic power of our Buddha to enlighten him, and use the mercy of Buddhism to change his anger and make him free from the bitter sea of evil spirits. This is also a matter of great merit. The heaven should be merciful to the superior, and the lower one can comfort the dead Master Puzhi. Master, be merciful! &quot;</p>
<p>Then he fell on the ground with both hands. Three times in a row.</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong shook his head and sighed: &ldquo;crazy son! Crazy! You can see that your words, on the contrary, move the anger ring. What&rsquo;s more, I don&rsquo;t want to be a teacher. However, he has experienced many hardships and ups and downs in his life. Up to now, he has been determined as a rock, and ordinary people can shake his heart. It is the so-called Buddha in the heart, all sentient beings have Buddhism. It&rsquo;s all in his mind that he will fall into the sea of misery or return to bliss. We can&rsquo;t exert our power on him. &quot;</p>
<p>The Dharma Minister stood up slowly, bowed his head and folded his head. He was disappointed, but he said in a low voice: &ldquo;yes, I understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pu Hong pondered for a moment and said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;d better go to the back cottage to see him. Although the cold in the room should be OK, it&rsquo;s not a good thing that he doesn&rsquo;t get water and rice all day and night with his present body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dharma responded, calmed down, and went outside. He was pulling the door open. When he wanted to go out, he suddenly saw a man standing outside the door. The sun was shining in from behind the man. The man&rsquo;s face was a shadow. He could not see his face clearly for a moment.</p>
<p>FA Xiang was startled and stepped back. Then he could see that he was ghostly. He didn&rsquo;t know when he came to the door outside the house and stood quietly. One day and one night, it seems that there is no tired face, but his face has become very pale, and his eyes are full of blood, afraid that he has not closed his eyes this night.</p>
<p>When he saw that it was FA Xiang, he moved the corner of his mouth, and slowly nodded to FA Xiang. FA Xiang was stunned for a moment and then returned the ceremony. GUI Li then walked in slowly and stood opposite to the master Pu Hong.</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong is still the same as yesterday, sitting on the Zen bed, holding the rosary in his hand and constantly rotating. He was not surprised when he saw that he wanted to stop talking. He said to the Dharma minister, &ldquo;get a chair for the little benefactor. In addition, you can sit down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>FA Xiang agreed and dragged a chair to the ghost. He also sat on one side.</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong was silent for a moment and said, &ldquo;if you have anything to ask me now, just say hello.</p>
<p>&quot;</p>
<p>His eyes seemed to be wandering, as if his mood had not yet been calm. After a long time, he heard him say in a low voice: &ldquo;why did you Tianyin Temple save me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong said, &ldquo;everything has its own causes. Benefactor has today&rsquo;s rough situation, and most of the evil results planted by Puzhi junior brother of Tianyin temple in those years. In this way, Tianyin temple can not be saved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He snorted, &ldquo;if you do this, you are not afraid that Qingyun gate will turn against you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong smiles and says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li was surprised when he was so frank and said, &ldquo;then you are still&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong shook his head and said, &ldquo;Tianyin temple has made good relations with Qingyun gate for generations. The ancestors of all ages have reprimanded them and should not be destroyed at will. That&rsquo;s why I ordered them to take you back in black without any trace. &quot;</p>
<p>GUI Li sneered and said, &ldquo;the experts in Qingyun gate are like clouds. What if you expose your tracks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong said, &ldquo;I told them to hide their traces for the sake of the harmony between the two parties, and I did not want to have a quarrel between the two schools of justice. But if it turns out to be an accident, it&rsquo;s nothing. In order to save the benefactor, you have to turn your back. &quot;</p>
<p>Staring at master Pu Hong, he said in a deep voice, &ldquo;what are you doing to save me so recklessly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This time, master Pu Hong was silent, but he did not ask questions. He just looked at him.</p>
<p>After a long time, master Pu Hong sighed and said, &ldquo;do you want to know what happened when Puzhi junior brother was dying and struggled back to Tianyin temple until his death?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was so shocked that he couldn&rsquo;t speak for a moment. Seeing the pain in his eyes, it seemed that there was another storm in his heart. Finally, he whispered, &ldquo;I want to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Somehow, his voice was hoarse. (to be continued. )</p>
