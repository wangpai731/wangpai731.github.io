      <p>Unknown mountains, deep in the jungle, thunderstorm from what time, gradually weak, until dusk, the rain stopped, although there is only a dim sunset in the distance, can vaguely see some incomplete rainbow.</p>
<p>It seems that with the setting sun, the rainbow is also gradually fragmented.</p>
<p>It was quiet in the jungle, and even the smell of blood disappeared. Only the corpses along the way witnessed a fierce killing here.</p>
<p>Chen Heng fell to the ground, until his death, it seems that there is a will in his eyes, some unwilling, some inconceivable.</p>
<p>Beside his body, Bai Xiaochun did not move. If his life was a fire, at the moment, the fire had been extinguished by more than 90%, leaving only one flame, struggling to survive there.</p>
<p>For a long time, there were footsteps coming from afar, stepping on the fallen leaves in the muddy water, approaching step by step, until standing in front of Chen Heng, the sound of footsteps disappeared.</p>
<p>He was an old man, wearing a black robe, his white hair fluttering, and many wrinkles on his face. A strong sense of the vicissitudes of life could not be covered on his body. It seemed that he had survived for too long in this world, and even the vicissitudes had turned into death and covered all directions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cling to your mind and coagulate your soul It can be used if the body dies but the soul does not disperse. &quot; The hoarse voice, with an ethereal meaning, reverberated around, a gap suddenly opened in the brow of Chen Heng&rsquo;s corpse, and a trace of blue air floated out, until it condensed in the air, and turned into a vague soul shadow the size of a palm.</p>
<p>It was Chen Heng, but his eyes were dazed, as if he had lost all his senses and shivered.</p>
<p>The old man raised a finger with his right hand, and immediately Chen Heng&rsquo;s soul flew out and disappeared into his fingers.</p>
<p>After taking away Chen Heng&rsquo;s soul, the mysterious old man turned his head and looked at Bai Xiaochun in silence. His face was somewhat complicated, and his memory gradually appeared in his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect to see The immortal immortal work&hellip; &quot; The old man closed his eyes and sighed after a long time. The sigh seemed to change the nothingness around him, making this area as if the passage of time was different from the usual, such as isolation from the world.</p>
<p>Countless plants shake, blink of an eye, such as the silence, turned into dust.</p>
<p>The corpse of Chen Heng is withered by naked eyes, that is, during a few breathing times, his whole body becomes a skeleton, until it turns into dust and melts into the muddy water.</p>
<p>Only Bai Xiaochun, he not only did not decay, but also had a lot of vitality come, into his body, quickly repair his seriously injured body.</p>
<p>The old man closed his eyes and stood there, like a statue, motionless. If he looked at him carefully, it seemed that No breath, no life, the whole person does not seem to exist in this world, such as a wisp of unwilling to die.</p>
<p>At the same time, at the moment of Chen Heng&rsquo;s death, in the Luoxing mountain range, the Laochen ancestor in the Luochen family suddenly opened his eyes, and his heart was filled with uneasiness. His eyes swept over the people around him. Although he saw the 11 clansmen sent out and died a lot, Chen Heng&rsquo;s soul card was still there, and his heart was more stable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just three other disciples. How could it be so long Moreover, many people have died. However, heng&rsquo;er&rsquo;s cultivation should not hinder him. Maybe now heng&rsquo;er has killed the three young people and is on his way back. &quot; When Laozu Luochen was meditating, the feeling of uneasiness still existed. His eyes flashed, and he sent several people of seven layers of condensate to explore.</p>
<p>After that, he had a strong light in his eyes and took a deep breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No matter what, there is still one day to go. The anti blood method will succeed!&rdquo; As soon as Laozu Chen bit his teeth and suppressed all his restless thoughts, he realized that he had no way out and had no other choice but to survive for another day All is enough!</p>
<p>At the same time, in a valley less than 10 li away from Laozu Chen&rsquo;s array, Hou Yunfei&rsquo;s face was pale and could not move on. The whole person spat out blood and collapsed in a miserable laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Younger martial brother Bai Sorry, I didn&rsquo;t save you&hellip; &quot; Before he was in a coma, he was holding his fist, filled with sadness and helplessness.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Du Lingfei&rsquo;s hair was dishevelled and her whole body was haggard to the extreme. Her meridians had been broken, and her appearance was quite different from that of the past.</p>
<p>Her eyes are inanimate, like walking corpses, all relying on an amazing will to support, now staggering at a gallop, her hand holding a jade Jane, her mind at the moment only a strong idea.</p>
<p>Rush out, spread the letter, save Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>Step by step, she fell down and then got up again. Even though her clothes were damaged a lot, even if the blood was almost dried up, even if her eyes were blurred, she was still Keep running forward.</p>
<p>As time went by slowly, Du Lingfei had already forgotten her body injury and her life. She did not know how long she had gone until she took a step, her whole body suddenly trembled, as if she had come out of the water. In her unconscious eyes, a strong look appeared in this moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you out&hellip;&rdquo; Du Lingfei&rsquo;s lips were dry and cracked. At the moment, she was shaking and holding the jade slips in her hand. The jade slips, which had not been moving for half a month, suddenly vibrated at this moment. It seemed that an invisible channel was going through all the spaces, connecting her with the family Connected together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Luochen family rebelled. Senior brother Feng died in battle. Elder martial brother Hou&rsquo;s life and death are unknown. Younger martial brother Bai In order to save us and lead away the enemy, he is being chased. Disciple Du Lingfei asks for the clan Quick rescue. &quot; Du Lingfei after the news, the whole person suddenly paralyzed down, sitting there, looking back at the heaven and earth behind him, tears streaming down.</p>
<p>She can&rsquo;t forget the iron and blood figure when Bai Xiaochun came back, the sadness and heroism when Bai Xiaochun rushed out and led the Luo Chen family away, and all kinds of things along the way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Younger martial brother Bai, elder martial brother hou Live on&hellip; &quot; Du Lingfei cried, tears continue to fall, the whole person also can not support, coma in the past.</p>
<p>Almost at the moment of Du Lingfei&rsquo;s preaching to the sect, the mission Pavilion of Xiangyun mountain on the South Bank of Lingxi sect was very lively. Many disciples from outside came and went. Deep in the attic, a middle-aged man in a Taoist robe was sorting out the tasks of the sect. There were thousands of jade slips in front of him. However, the jade slips here would be recorded at any time for any disciple who took over the mission.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, one of the jade slips flashed, and the middle-aged man waved as usual. The jade slips flew in. After sweeping his divine sense, he suddenly opened his eyes and suddenly stood up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Luochen family defected!&rdquo; He is short of breath. This matter is too big. Whether it is true or not, he needs to report it immediately. If someone dares to suppress this kind of matter, it will be a great crime of extinction. The middle-aged man dare not delay. He immediately takes a purple jade slip from his body and sends a message.</p>
<p>This information was directly transmitted to the law enforcement hall. Although Qian Dajin was a member of the law enforcement hall, he was in a low position, and this matter was far beyond his reach. After receiving this information, the law enforcement hall immediately started to search for information. This protected the law enforcement Hall of lingxizong, and at this moment, it broke out with amazing efficiency.</p>
<p>It took only a stick of incense to confirm that the information was true.</p>
<p>Soon, the sound of battle drums was heard all over the south bank. When it reverberated in all directions, all the disciples on the south bank were in a daze. Those outside disciples did not know what the drum was. However, the inner disciples of the three mountains on the south bank, no matter who they were, looked greatly changed when they heard the drum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The battle drum up, does not see the blood, does not exterminate the clan, the Lingxi does not return!! My God&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>All of a sudden, an old but lonely voice spread across the South Bank of Lingxi.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My law enforcement hall, Ouyang Jie, the three mountains on the south bank, all the inner disciples have cancelled all tasks, all activities, all closed doors, and assembled in front of the mountain gate within 20 rest!</p>
<p>There must be no mistake! &quot;</p>
<p>As the words spread out, Qingfeng mountain, Xiangyun mountain, ziding mountain, all the inner disciples, no matter what they were doing, all of them trembled without any hesitation.</p>
<p>Even if there is a big thing, I dare not delay at this moment, because the name of Ouyang Jie represents the elder of law enforcement hall and also represents unfeeling!</p>
<p>He has a Taoist name called Taoist jackal. Once he appears, it shows something that makes the clan furious. It needs Killing people needs Extermination!</p>
<p>There are one or two thousand inner disciples in the three mountains on the south bank. These people are rarely seen in ordinary days, but now all of them appear, which makes all the outer disciples shocked.</p>
<p>There are also a group of law enforcement hall disciples in black long clothes. They look like hundreds of people. They rush out at the first time. The first one is an old man. His red hair is fluttering and the whole person is murderous. He is Ouyang Jie.</p>
<p>At the moment, there are more than 2000 people around the mountain gate, and they all look grim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Luochen family rebelled and was ordered by the leader to take this family All the chickens and dogs will be killed. Please plant and transmit them! &quot; Ouyang Jie big sleeve a swing, immediately Lingxi Zong is in the middle of the seed road mountain, a fierce shock, burst out a light column.</p>
<p>In mid air, the light column immediately turned into a huge transmission array. Suddenly, it came down and covered more than 2000 disciples inside and outside the mountain gate. The transmission was about to start.</p>
<p>All the disciples of the south bank all took a breath at the moment. Looking at this scene, they soon felt a strong sense of pride and identification with the sect.</p>
<p>Compared with Lingxi clan, the Luochen family is only a small family with only one foundation builder. But now, Lingxi clan has sent out more than 2000 people for the sake of several external disciples, and the Iron-blooded Ouyang Jie appears. Obviously It&rsquo;s for deterrence!</p>
<p>To deter all Xiuzhen families within the scope of Lingxi sect, this is not to kill chickens with an ox knife, this is to kill chickens with an ox knife!</p>
<p>For all the disciples, the identity of such a sect, which can exert such force at all costs, is extremely strong.</p>
<p>Lingxi sect will never fall down. From a tiny sect to today, it has its own amazing features!</p>
<p>At this time, suddenly, in the hall at the top of Xiangyun mountain, Li Qinghou&rsquo;s face was iron blue, and his figure roared out. A torrential evil spirit broke out on him at this moment, forming a strong wind, roaring everywhere, and running straight to the array.</p>
