      <p>Qingyun Mountain, Tongtian peak, ancestral hall.</p>
<p>The green forest is still the same as before, dense and vigorous growth, light morning fog is floating in the forest, everywhere you can see the leaves and branches, grass and wild flowers on the leaf petals, there are crystal dew gently shaking in the breeze. In the distance, there are still clear and pleasant birds singing in the deep forest. Listening to it, it is one of the clearness of mind and body, like a fairyland.</p>
<p>In this world resort, Taoist fairyland, a squat figure slowly appeared on the path in the forest. It was the field that was not easy.</p>
<p>It seems that it is not in harmony with the surrounding scenery. Tian Bu Yi has a dignified look on his face. His eyes are directly in front of him, and his expression on his face seems to be full of worries. At the moment, there is no one around him, and it seems strange. Tian Buyi, as the head of Dazhu peak, is one of the most important people in Qingyun gate. However, it is also strange to come to the ancestral hall of the important place behind Tongtian peak in changmen.</p>
<p>On the mountain road, there is no disciple of Qingyun gate to guard. Along the way, there is no voice. In the breeze and birdsong, Tian is not easy to turn around the famous three forks, and gradually see the majestic cornice in the deep forest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know where the sound of bells and drums is coming from the direction of the front mountain, reverberating in Qingyun Mountain.</p>
<p>That piece of empty, floating echo, let the field not easy to stop quietly, look back, overlook.</p>
<p>Heaven and earth, sky is blue and infinite!</p>
<p>For thousands of years, it seems that they have not changed.</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi gradually calmed down and stood in silence for a while, then turned back again and walked toward the ancestral hall.</p>
<p>The vast stone steps were displayed in front of him, but the ancestral hall still remained unchanged. It was like a sleeping beast, sleeping gently and lying in the arms of the forest. The gate of the ancestral hall is still open, and the darkness is still there, even the candles in the dark. As if also in the deep sleep general, everything, is so quiet.</p>
<p>Just outside this ancestral hall. Under the stone steps, there was still a young man standing with his back to the field. Tian Bu Yi frowned and walked over.</p>
<p>Hearing the footsteps, the young man seemed to be surprised. I didn&rsquo;t expect that someone would come to this place at this time and turn around.</p>
<p>Tian Buyi and the man face each other, they are Zheng for a while, the young man is Lin Jingyu.</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi immediately remembered that in the past, he had heard his disciples say that Lin Jingyu had been guarding the ancestral temple for someone, but no one seemed to know who the &ldquo;someone&rdquo; was. However, Tian is not easy. Naturally, he is not in the mood to think about it at the moment. He and Lin Jingyu have a bad relationship. They look at each other. They didn&rsquo;t speak immediately, and the atmosphere was a little awkward.</p>
<p>Finally, Lin Jingyu coughed and said in a low voice, &ldquo;Uncle Tian, why did you come here so early?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi looked at him, then his eyes moved to the dark inside the ancestral hall and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking for someone. What are you doing standing outside the ancestral hall in the early morning? &quot;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu&rsquo;s face changed slightly. A bitter smile appeared on his face. He took a look at the ancestral hall, but did not answer.</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi said lightly: &ldquo;is there anyone in it. Is it the leader</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu nodded and said, &ldquo;yes, the master is on the hall He ordered me to wait outside without his summons. None of the disciples on Tongtian peak are allowed to go in. &quot;</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi snorted and said coldly, &ldquo;I remember that you are a disciple of longshoufeng. Why did you run to Tongtian peak and take care of the gate for elder martial brother daoxuan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu&rsquo;s face turned white, and he bowed his head slightly and did not speak.</p>
<p>Tian is not easy to ignore him. Step up and step on the stone steps.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu was stunned and took a step. He said, &ldquo;Uncle Tian, what are you doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian not easy light way: &ldquo;I come here, naturally want to go in, I want to find the leader elder martial brother to say something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu frowned and said, &ldquo;Uncle Tian, the headmaster has said that no one wants to see him. Without his permission to summon him, everything under tongtianfeng sect is&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a disciple of tongtianfeng.&rdquo; Tian not easy cold interrupted Lin Jingyu&rsquo;s words.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu was choked by the field for a moment and couldn&rsquo;t speak.</p>
<p>The field is not easy to say more, walked up the stone steps, toward the ancestral hall.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu&rsquo;s body moved and seemed to want to stop it, but then he stopped again. Looking at Tian Buyi&rsquo;s short and plump body, the essence in his eyes twinkled.</p>
<p>Stepping into the high threshold, a faint smell of sandalwood suddenly comes to you. A huge shadow comes out from the deep of the hall, and gently blocks the light that still exists just now outside the ancestral hall.</p>
<p>The field is not easy to stand in place for a moment, this just slowly walked into the deep inside.</p>
<p>With the slow rise and fall of footsteps, the expression on his face seems to be changing slowly.</p>
<p>Huge pillars painted with red paint stand in the hall at random, supporting the magnificent hall. The yellow cloth curtain hanging from the ceiling is quietly hanging beside the pillars. Many of them are worn-out. In my eyes, it seems that it is a vicissitude of life, which is revealed from the fading yellow.</p>
<p>The past time seems to solidify here.</p>
<p>The ancestral hall is very quiet, almost no sound can be heard, only the feet that are not easy to step out of the field reverberate in the surrounding silent shadow.</p>
<p>Behind the huge table in the distance, countless incense sticks are bright and quietly burning, just like a mysterious and strange eye, watching the figure shuttling in the shadow of the palace.</p>
<p>Turning around the thickest pillar in the hall and passing through the low yellow curtain, the field finally stopped.</p>
<p>In front of him was an open space. There were three rows of futons on the ground, seven in each row. In the middle of the first row, a familiar figure was sitting there, motionless. In front of the putuan, there is a huge table for offering fruit offerings. In the middle of the table is a large censer, which is very strange. There are only three incense sticks in it, and the smoke is curling up slowly.</p>
<p>Through the smoke curling around the offering table, in the dark behind the table, you can vaguely see countless spirit cards. Each one seems to have handwriting on it, and it is placed upright on the spirit tablet in the shadow.</p>
<p>Tian Buyi&rsquo;s face gradually became heavy and respectful. Facing the spirit of the ancestors of Qingyun gate, his eyes first stayed on the familiar figure for a moment, then walked up in silence.</p>
<p>The body of daoxuan immortal. He moved a little, but didn&rsquo;t look back.</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi walked slowly to the altar, looked at the countless spirits shrouded in the shadow, and deeply breathed in. Then he took three incense sticks out of the sachet beside the censer, lit it carefully on the candle fire nearby, stepped back and stood three feet in front of the altar. Three times, please.</p>
<p>The place where the immortal daoxuan sat was only six feet away from the altar table, but the dim light in front of him seemed to be unable to shine on his place. In the dark shadow, he slowly raised his head and stood in front of him with his back.</p>
<p>The dark depths, suddenly, such as the ghost fire in the deep of the nether world, &ldquo;suddenly&rdquo; a rising. Two fine lights flash in an instant.</p>
<p>Almost at the same time, as an invisible ghost whistling wave swept through the hall, all the incense candles and lights were lit up except for the three incense sticks held by Tian Buyi.</p>
<p>Tian Buyi has finished his visit at the moment. He is about to insert the incense into the censer, but his body suddenly stops. Even his hands holding incense are also in the air.</p>
<p>In the hall, suddenly fell into a dead silence. The two figures, standing and sitting, seemed to be frozen and motionless. The yellow curtain in the distance. I don&rsquo;t know why, it seems that there is a breeze blowing on the hall, gently floating a few times, and then slowly static down.</p>
<p>Outside the ancestral hall, Lin Jingyu is frowning and pondering, but suddenly he feels something. Suddenly, he looked up at the quiet and dark ancestral hall, and he was surprised.</p>
<p>In a trance, once a quiet and deep sleep of this temple, but like a wake-up monster, coldly, opened his eyes.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how long after that, the mysterious ghost fire in daoxuan&rsquo;s eyes suddenly disappeared again. It came suddenly and went quickly. With the strange eyes slowly closed, the original killing hall suddenly eased down, and the surrounding candles gradually lost their brightness and returned to the original dim light.</p>
<p>Field not easy in the hands of the fragrance, still curl to light, three tiny incense, looming in the dark. But the fine fragrance trembles, but has the white flocculent general fragrant ash to fall gently, fell on the field not easy hand.</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi looked at the dust on the back of his hand coldly. He stood in silence for a moment. He shook his hands and shook them off. Then he took a step and put the three incense sticks into the censer respectfully.</p>
<p>Six incense sticks were lit in the censer at the same time, and the light smoke was floating and curling up.</p>
<p>Without saying a word, Tian Bu Yi worshipped the throne three times, then slowly turned around and faced the figure sitting on the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elder martial brother daoxuan,&rdquo; he looked at the man deeply. He did not know how. He was surprised, indignant and even more painful. He said slowly, &ldquo;we have met again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Most of daoxuan&rsquo;s face was covered in shadow, which was not true. He seemed to turn a deaf ear to Tian Bu Yi&rsquo;s voice. He did not respond at all. He still sat quietly.</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi stood and looked at him for a moment, and didn&rsquo;t say anything more, but his face was more and more heavy.</p>
<p>He gently moved the corner of his mouth and stepped forward, but he came to the side of daoxuan immortal and sat down on another Futon less than three feet away from him.</p>
<p>Above the hall, there was silence.</p>
<p>Southern Xinjiang, 100000 mountains, jiaohei peaks.</p>
<p>Along the way, the ghostly howl of ghosts became more and more powerful. The wind from nowhere also kept whining, blowing on people like knives. If it wasn&rsquo;t for the ghost sharp and the Golden Vase son, it was a profound Taoist practice. Just this ghost crying and howling and cold wind would be enough to drive people crazy.</p>
<p>The gloomy atmosphere around them became more and more intense, and both of them were more and more alert. However, until they got to the bottom of the valley, they were far away from where they could see the deep and dark entrance of the town&rsquo;s Magic Cave, and they were not in any danger or ambush. This place is so quiet that there are no ferocious monsters. The poisonous insects and beasts that can be seen everywhere after entering the 100000 mountains have disappeared.</p>
<p>This gloomy place seems to be the safest place among the poor mountains and rivers</p>
<p>GUI Li and Jin Ping&rsquo;er stood on a hill, overlooking the ancient and deep cave from a distance. You can also see the stone statue standing at the entrance of the cave.</p>
<p>Both of them frowned slightly. At this time and place, the unexpected calm brought them greater worry.</p>
<p>The Golden Vase pointed to the cave and said, &ldquo;there is the ancient cave of demons. When I came here after the man in black, I saw the beast God come out of this cave with my own eyes. &quot;</p>
<p>He nodded slightly, and then looked around the cave, except for the dark hole. The cave is surrounded by vertical cliffs, grotesque rocks are ferocious, and ten feet above the cave, close to the stone wall, there is a thick layer of black clouds, slowly flowing in the air. Like water clouds. Look at the dark color. It must be poisonous. At a glance, ordinary people are definitely nowhere to go, but a place of death.</p>
<p>Taking back his eyes, he pondered for a moment and said, &ldquo;shall we go in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, the Golden Vase son was slightly hesitant. After a long silence, she still nodded and said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s all. How can we hold back when we come here? Let&rsquo;s go</p>
<p>After a fierce look at her, she saw that there was something strange about the Golden Vase son&rsquo;s face, and his face was slightly white. Obviously, he still had some scruples about the mysterious cave.</p>
<p>In fact, it is not only her, but also the monkey little ash, who seems to have changed her temper at the moment and seems to be very quiet.</p>
<p>As if feeling something, the Golden Vase turned her head. Looking at GUI Li, he suddenly began to smile, showing a beautiful white teeth and smiling: &ldquo;I may as well do something. Go on</p>
<p>He nodded his head and went first. The Golden Vase son followed him and walked slowly towards the ancient cave.</p>
<p>The sound of stepping on the hard scorched rock block was quickly submerged in the howling wind. The closer we approached the cave entrance, the stronger the bitter wind became. The more cold and gloomy the wind contains, the colder it is.</p>
<p>At the moment, both of them have found that the source of the cold wind all over the mountain is blown out of the ancient cave.</p>
<p>As we got closer and closer to the cave entrance, the light around it seemed to be gradually dimmed. More and more brilliance was blocked by the black clouds above the entrance of the ancient cave, as if such a place was not allowed to enter.</p>
<p>And standing in the deep hole, facing the deep cave, the stone statue gradually appeared in front of them.</p>
<p>The road was not very long, but for them, it seemed that they had walked for a long time. When they finally stood at the entrance of Zhenmo ancient cave, the sky was completely darkened. The sun that had been warm not long ago had completely disappeared above the black clouds.</p>
<p>GUI Li slowly turned to the entrance of the cave and stood in front of the woman&rsquo;s stone statue.</p>
<p>Dim light, shining on her body</p>
<p>Thousands of years of wind and frost, will initially soft and beautiful smooth, slowly carved into rough, vicissitudes of time, and how many eyes, once so light quiet gaze at your face.</p>
<p>Time like a long river of water surging forward, never stay half a minute, the initial moved, the initial memory, that countless have been deeply engraved between the threads of the heart, the original, after all, will be forgotten.</p>
<p>Only a trace of the legend remains, after a long time, was inadvertently mentioned by later generations.</p>
<p>You have been beautiful, once heroic, in front of time, ash fly smoke scattered.</p>
<p>The cold wind, swept over the lapel, blowing in the body, thousands of years of gazing, perhaps, after all, can not compare to, a read between regret!</p>
<p>Soft hand, gently patted on the shoulder, the monkey small gray squeak, in the ear ring up, the body of the ghost slightly shocked, suddenly back a step, and then wake up, he was unconsciously, in the gaze of this young woman stone statue, indulged in the past.</p>
<p>With this in mind, the ghost Li&rsquo;s back was like being punctured, and his heart was slightly shocked. With his practice of Taoism at this time and his strong ambition, he even unconsciously practiced Tao when facing this exquisite stone statue of witch. The extraordinary power contained in this stone statue is really very important.</p>
<p>Ghost Li settled down, and then turned to look at the Golden Vase. If Jin Ping&rsquo;er hadn&rsquo;t reminded him just now, I don&rsquo;t know how long he would be addicted to the stone statue. But how could the Golden Vase be wary of the stone statue that God did not know? Is it possible that this woman is unexpectedly unexpected, there is still hidden strength?</p>
<p>GUI Li turned his head and looked, but he was stunned. Although Jin pinger stood beside him and patted him on the shoulder, his whole body was in the opposite direction to that of GUI Li. Facing the entrance of Zhenmo ancient cave and facing the stone statue, he did not look at the face of the stone statue.</p>
<p>GUI Li frowned and said, &ldquo;what are you doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Golden Vase son smile slightly, way: &ldquo;this stone statue is very powerful, didn&rsquo;t I tell you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grimace eyebrow is a frown again, hum a, breathe deeply. At this time, the little ash, who had been lying on his shoulder, seemed to be impatient. The monkey&rsquo;s tail wagged, and suddenly jumped out of his fierce shoulder. All of a sudden, he jumped onto the stone statue. After climbing for several times, he finally sat on the top of the stone statue.</p>
<p>His face changed, and suddenly he said in a deep voice, &ldquo;Xiao Hui, come here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The monkey looked at GUI Li, reached for his head and squeaked twice, but he still jumped back from the stone statue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you scare the monkey to do? It&rsquo;s just fun&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before saying a word, Jin pinger was slightly surprised. He saw the ghost put on the front color and arranged his clothes. He actually saluted the statue respectfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; said the Golden Vase</p>
<p>GUI Li&rsquo;s face was indifferent, but he didn&rsquo;t answer. He just looked at the stone statue deeply, arched his hand, and then turned around. He said faintly, &ldquo;nothing. Let&rsquo;s go in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was in front of them that the ancient cave was deep and the wind was blowing.</p>
<p>Jin Ping&rsquo;er followed GUI Li and looked at the monkey Xiao Hui, who was just looking bored. Then his eyes fell on GUI Li and said, &ldquo;why did you salute the stone statue just now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a pause, he continued to walk forward and said calmly: &ldquo;the style of our predecessors has long been lost, but there is always something worthy of respect in people&rsquo;s hearts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jinpinger frowned, obviously puzzled by Gui Li&rsquo;s words like playing a riddle. He was about to ask, but GUI Li had already approached the hole.</p>
<p>Jinpinger ran after her and frowned: &ldquo;Hello, I&rsquo;m talking to you! What are you doing so fast? I haven&rsquo;t told you that when I came here last time, there was a ferocious spirit here. Although most of them were removed by the beast God, most of the cave entrance was&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>Speaking of this, the voice of the Golden Vase son suddenly went down, almost at the same time, the ghostly step also stopped.</p>
<p>Standing a few feet away from the entrance of the ancient cave, the two men looked at the dark and dark cave. Under the strong wind, there was no sign of dissipation.</p>
<p>Seeing that white air gathering more and more, the volume is getting bigger and bigger, and finally gradually condenses into shape. In the white air, a huge figure appears faintly. The roar is heavy and the roar bursts. It is mixed with the howling wind and increases the prestige, just like a fierce ghost and God.</p>
<p>The Golden Vase looked at the white air, sighed, shook his head, and said, &ldquo;well, now you can see that there is a fierce and bad tempered spirit here!&rdquo; (to be continued. )</p>
