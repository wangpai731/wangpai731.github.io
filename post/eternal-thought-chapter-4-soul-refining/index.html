<p>When they looked at Bai Xiaochun, they felt that Bai Xiaochun was not only cute, but also had a lot of bad water in his stomach. So Zhang daphou made the decision and rewarded Bai Xiaochun with a grain of LingMi, which was put in Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s hands.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun is very happy with a smile. Before she gets to bed, the aura accumulated in her body from innumerable talents will burst out. When her head is dizzy, she falls on the ground and sleeps.</p>
<p>The next morning, Bai Xiaochun opened her eyes and was in high spirits. When she looked down, she found that she had gained a lot of weight. Her whole body was sticky and covered with a layer of black dirt. She went out to clean it quickly. Zhang daphou and others were busy with their disciples&rsquo; Breakfast. When they saw Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s appearance, they all laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ninth younger martial brother, those dirt are impurities in your body. When you remove them, you will have a lot of success in your practice. You don&rsquo;t need your help these days. You will be working in the next few days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That LingMi is a good thing. Remember to eat it quickly. If it is not good for a long time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun was fresh and fresh. After nodding, she went back to the room, and her eyes fell on the turtle shaped pot. She simply carried it out and washed it. She brought it back to the room and put it on the stove. She took the grain of LingMi in her hand and looked at it. It was the size of the little thumb of the rice. It was crystal smooth and fragrant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the immortal eats is really extraordinary.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun sighed and ignited several pieces of wood in the stove. Just as soon as it burned, a burst of heat hit his face. Bai Xiaochun was in a daze. He quickly stepped back and looked at the fire in the stove. He was amazed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fire is not ordinary. It&rsquo;s not only burning fast, but also much hotter than the fire in the village.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun looked at the wood in the fire stove again and thought that it should be a good wood.</p>
<p>At this time, with the flame burning, Bai Xiaochun was surprised to see that the first line on the turtle shaped pot turned bright from bottom to top. Soon, all the lines were lit up.</p>
<p>White small pure Leng for a moment, suddenly a pat thigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said, this is a treasure, it must be better than the big brother&rsquo;s pot.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun felt that the pot was extraordinary and threw LingMi into the pot.</p>
<p>Sitting on one side and waiting, he picked up the bamboo book of Ziqi yudinggong and began to practice according to the movements and breathing of the first picture inside.</p>
<p>Almost as soon as he practiced, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s eyes widened. He found that the difficult posture he had put out yesterday was extremely smooth, and he didn&rsquo;t feel uncomfortable at the moment. Even the way of breathing, there was no suffocation, but a very comfortable feeling.</p>
<p>In particular, he clearly remembered that before the most is three or four breaths, but now seven or eight breaths have passed without any pain.</p>
<p>Endure the exhilaration, Bai Xiaochun calmed himself down until he held on to thirty breaths. When he felt weak pain in his body, suddenly, a wisp of air appeared from his body. The air was cold and quickly swam in his body. Although he did not have a complete swim around, he still let Bai Xiaochun jump up excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Angry, ha ha, angry!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun was overjoyed and walked around the house. He also thought of the reason why he must have eaten those Tiancai Dibao last night. At the bottom of his heart, he felt that he had eaten less.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No wonder elder martial brother Zhang said that he would rather die of starvation in the fire stove than fight for the front in the outer gate. The outer disciples would not have such good things.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun quickly sat down and practiced again.</p>
<p>This time, according to the breathing method of the first layer of Ziqi controlling tripod skill and the movement of the first picture, he persisted until sixty breath. At the moment of reaching the sixty breath, a pulse of Qi twice as large as before suddenly emerged and swam quickly in his body like a trickle.</p>
<p>With experience, Bai Xiaochun quickly followed the signs on the first picture and silently thought about several routes in his body.</p>
<p>Soon, the air trickle in his body followed the route as Bai Xiaochun thought. With Bai Xiaochun still sticking to the action of putting out the first picture, he even noticed that there was a trace of cool air coming out from all parts of his body, like water drops, and integrated into the trickle of Qi, making the trickle bigger and bigger.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, it turned into a small stream. After a complete swim, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s whole body was shocked. His mind was like a cloud, and there was a boom.</p>
<p>An unprecedented feeling of lightness immediately appeared on his body, and a mass of dirt was continuously secreted along his sweat pores.</p>
<p>And the stream in his body did not dissipate as before, but always existed. He walked slowly all over his body. Bai Xiaochun opened his eyes, and his eyes were clearer and more flexible.</p>
<p>Even the body obviously feels lighter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Qi pulse is always present, which is the performance of the first level of Ziqi controlling tripod skill, and also represents the first level of condensing gas.&rdquo; I can&rsquo;t help but go out in vain.</p>
<p>After seeing this, Zhang daphou and others showed a smile that they knew each other. Although they were surprised that Bai Xiaochun had completed the first layer so quickly, they understood why.</p>
<p>Returning to the house, Bai Xiaochun took a few deep breaths, picked up the bamboo book on one side and looked at it carefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After the first level of controlling tripod skill, you can control some objects. This is the magic power of immortals. You can take pictures from the sky.&rdquo; According to the above method, Bai Xiaochun pinched out a simple seal with both hands and pointed to the table beside him. At once, he felt the stream in his body, like a runaway wild horse running straight to his right index finger, even out of the fingertip.</p>
<p>It seems that an invisible silk thread is formed and connected with the table. Unfortunately, as soon as it is connected, the thread is unstable and breaks with a crack.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun was pale, and it took a long time to recover. After careful consideration, he gave up the table and took out the wooden sword from his pocket. He did not know what wood the wooden sword was made of. Although it was not as heavy as the table, it was also a little heavy. He raised a finger with his right hand.</p>
<p>The wooden sword suddenly vibrated and floated slowly, but it only rose an inch and then fell down again.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun was not discouraged. After many exciting attempts, the wooden sword dropped from the beginning to ten, twenty and thirty inches At dusk, the wooden sword in his room could float away in a straight line. Although it was not fast and difficult to turn, it would not fall as easily as it did in the early days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From then on, I am a fairy Bai Xiaochun stood there, a proud look, with his left hand behind him, his right hand raised and waved forward, and the wooden sword swayed back and forth.</p>
<p>When the breath in his body was unstable, Bai Xiaochun took back his wooden sword and was about to continue his practice. Suddenly, he smelled the aroma coming from the pot on the side. He looked up and took a deep breath, and immediately his appetite moved. On this day, he was busy practicing, but he forgot that there was still LingMi in the pot, so he went forward to open the lid of the pot.</p>
<p>At the moment of opening the lid, a strong aroma came out from the LingMi in the pot, but on the LingMi, I don&rsquo;t know why, there was a sharp silver grain!</p>
<p>This silver grain is very obvious. If you look at it carefully, it can even attract people&rsquo;s mind. But as time goes on, it gradually becomes dark silver. Bai Xiaochun squints her eyes, thinks about it, and then takes out the grain of LingMi and checks it in her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a little familiar&hellip;&rdquo; White small pure eyes show thinking, look down at the fire stove, found that the fire inside has long been extinguished, even wood has become ashes, and a bright line on the pot, also dim again.</p>
<p>As like as two peas, he recognized the grain of the rice on the grain.</p>
<p>In order to be safe, Bai Xiaochun did not eat the rice, but put it in a cloth bag. After thinking for a moment, she walked out of the house and worked with Zhang daphou and others.</p>
<p>As time went by, half a month passed by in a flash. In the past half month, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s practice stopped again and made slow progress. However, he also found out that when others cooked LingMi, there would be no silver grain.</p>
<p>Curious, he felt more and more that his grain of rice was not right, especially the pot. Finally, a few days later, when he went out to the fire kitchen to buy what he needed, he went to Sihai room, where he had found out, and the servants could go to the place where he knew the common sense of practice.</p>
<p>After returning from sihaifang, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s heart beat strongly. He endured the surprise until he returned to the room. He immediately took out the grain of LingMi and carefully looked at the silver grain on it. His eyes slowly showed an incredible color.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are three indispensable practices for immortal cultivation, namely, refining medicine, refining utensils and Refining Bai Xiaochun thinks about the pictures of alchemy described in the ancient books in sihaifang, comparing the silver grain on LingMi, the more you look, the more you look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Refining!&rdquo; For a long time, he took a long breath.</p>
<p>Alchemy is a special way to force the power of heaven and earth into the objects. It is just like using the method of creation instead of the way of heaven to plunder the power of heaven and earth. No matter it is a pill, a medicine or a magic weapon, you can refine spirit. Therefore, it is not allowed by heaven and earth. Therefore, there is a certain probability that once successful, the power of the item will be greatly increased, and if it fails, it will make the item directly Under the power of heaven and earth, it becomes waste.</p>
<p>And the most amazing thing about alchemy is that it can be combined with refining, and even if you can successfully refine ten times, you can make things appear earth shaking changes.</p>
<p>And the more precious things are, the more terrifying it will be after adding alchemy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that the more you get to the back, the less likely you are to succeed. Even some alchemists dare not try it easily. After all, once the price of failure is too high to bear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has been said in ancient books that the most precious treasure of Lingxi sect is the Tianjiao sword which has been refined for ten times by great chance.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun felt some dry mouth and swallowed a mouthful of saliva. She was shocked and confused. She subconsciously looked at the dozens of dim lines on the turtle shaped pot and the speed of her heart beating, as if to jump out of her chest.</p>
<p>He has now confirmed that the reason why LingMi appeared to refine spirit lines is this pot!</p>
<p>After hesitating for a while, Bai Xiaochun gritted his teeth. If he did not solve the mystery, he would not be able to sleep. But he also knew that if the pot was really good, then such secrets should never be known to a second person.</p>
<p>So when it was late at night, he cautiously came to the pot. After taking a deep breath, he took out the wooden sword which he controlled and threw it into the pot according to the way that LingMi was thrown down that day.</p>
