      <p>[latest broadcast] tomorrow is 515, the start of the anniversary, the most welfare day. In addition to the gift bag and schoolbag, this &ldquo;515 red envelope crazily flipping&rdquo; must see that there is no reason why the red envelope should not be robbed~</p>
<p>Half a month later, Bai Xiaochun finally crushed Du Lingfei in xiaobizhong, which caused quite a stir in the clan.</p>
<p>As a result, every time Bai Xiaochun went out, some other disciples met and said hello with a smile, which made Bai Xiaochun immediately feel that she was also a celebrity, so she liked to go out. Every time she met a foreign disciple, she took the initiative to talk to each other, and then waited for the other party to ask who she was, and bravely said her name.</p>
<p>This kind of leisure life makes Bai Xiaochun very happy. Du Lingfei&rsquo;s pill was also swallowed by him after three times of soul refining. His cultivation successfully broke through the great perfection of the fifth layer of condensate gas and reached the sixth layer of condensate gas.</p>
<p>With Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s practice, the method of lifting weights as light as possible has become more and more quintessence. He has even begun to study the second realm of Ziqi controlling tripod.</p>
<p>It seems not difficult, but in fact, Bai Xiaochun has tried for a long time, and has never been able to get into the door.</p>
<p>On this day, he was sitting in the yard with his knees crossed. When he practiced lifting light and heavy weights, he looked slightly. He put up his wooden sword and looked up to the outside of the yard. Not long after, there was a knock on the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is elder martial brother Bai in?&rdquo; A familiar voice came from the door of Bai Xiaochun. He was slightly surprised that few people came to his yard. At the moment, his right hand raised a finger at the door of the yard, which creaked and opened itself, revealing a thin young man outside.</p>
<p>The young man dressed in the clothes of the disciples of the outer gate. At the moment when the door opened, the young man looked solemn and bowed his fist toward the courtyard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Xu Baocai, meet elder martial brother Bai.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it you?&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun was stunned. The man outside was Xu Baocai, who had a fight with Bai Xiaochun when he was in the fire kitchen room. Xu Baocai also went to the third floor of condensation gas, and now he has become a disciple of the outer gate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;m still unconvinced when I become an outsider. Do you want to fight with me again?&rdquo; As soon as Bai Xiaochun sweeps, he can see the cultivation of the other party&rsquo;s three layers of condensate gas. He immediately puts down his heart and looks serious.</p>
<p>Hearing the speech, Xu Baocai shook his head in a hurry, and with a bitter smile on his face, he worshipped Bai Xiaochun again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know anything before. Don&rsquo;t make fun of me, elder martial brother Bai. This time Xu is here to make amends to elder martial brother Bai and solve the problems of that year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xu Bao is sincere, and he really wants to resolve it. After all, he has become a disciple of other schools. He has already paid less attention to what he once did.</p>
<p>The most important thing is that Bai Xiaochun is now in Xiangyun mountain, and he is also a famous person. Xu Baocai also chose Xiangyun mountain as an outsider. Naturally, he didn&rsquo;t want to cause unnecessary trouble because of the previous events. This came.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun blinked, thinking of the original, can&rsquo;t help but think of the fire kitchen room, now this Xu Baocai is also an old friend, so he got up and invited Xu Baocai into the yard, and they sat together and sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speaking of it, I didn&rsquo;t understand why you wrote so many bloody killing words. Although I understood later, I was still curious. Do you really feel no pain when you write so many words with blood?&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun asked a question, he has always been difficult to forget the other party&rsquo;s blood to kill the war book.</p>
<p>Xu Baocai&rsquo;s face is red, he now recalled the original, also feel strange, embarrassed to avoid the topic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elder martial brother Bai, you should be careful of those people in the supervisory room. I have heard that Chen Fei and others, who were pushed up the mountain by you, always hold a grudge against you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chen Fei?&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun was on guard immediately, and the big man in the supervisor&rsquo;s room appeared in his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is his cultivation now?&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun asked solemnly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is said that the fourth layer of condensate gas has been completed.&rdquo; Xu Baocai opened his mouth in a hurry. He told Bai Xiaochun that it was also to show his innocence and resolve his gratitude and resentment.</p>
<p>When Bai Xiaochun heard this, she immediately put down her heart and put on a light and cloudless look.</p>
<p>Xu Baocai did not continue to talk about Buddhism, but talked with Bai Xiaochun about the clan. Gradually, Bai Xiaochun found that Xu Baocai knew more than he did. It seemed that the South Bank of Lingxi was very familiar with the major and minor affairs. Even some secret things were also talked about with great relish. Especially for the gossip among some disciples, he talked about it vividly, as if he had seen it with his own eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elder martial brother Bai, speaking of my Lingxi sect, there are five beauties. Any one of these five beauties is absolutely beautiful. If we can get one, we will have no regrets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun is very interested and urges Xu Baocai to say more.</p>
<p>Xu Baocai saw that Bai Xiaochun liked to listen, and he did like to inquire about news here, so he said it with flying eyebrows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These five beauties, just in terms of appearance, are already equal and equal, but they are different in status. At the top of the list is Xu Meixiang, senior aunt Xu of ziding mountain. It is really beautiful and enchanting By the way, she is still the master of Zhang daphou. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah?&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun was really shocked this time. He heard Zhang Da Pang say his master several times. Every time he was an old witch, Bai Xiaochun thought that when he went to see Zhang daphou, the other side became thinner because the old witch didn&rsquo;t like fat people.</p>
<p>Thinking of this, Bai Xiaochun can&rsquo;t help but have some strange associations. With a dry cough, she quickly stops her thoughts. She thinks it&rsquo;s too dangerous to go on thinking like this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On Xiangyun mountain, there are also two of them: Zhou Xinqi, elder martial sister Zhou, and Du Lingfei, senior sister Du.&rdquo; Xu Baocai talks about Zhou Xinqi, and then leads to Tianjiao.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elder martial brother Bai, you should know that I live in Lingxi on the south bank, and there are three great Tianjiao. One is Zhou Xinqi from Xiangyun mountain, the other is LV Tianlei from ziding mountain, and the last one is It&rsquo;s the Shangguan Tianyou of Qingfeng mountain! Speaking of these three people, they are all unique talents! &quot; Xu Baocai&rsquo;s eyes showed envy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so powerful. It&rsquo;s just like me.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s mouth was turned away. Shangguan Tianyou and LV Tianlei didn&rsquo;t know each other. However, Zhou Xinqi had contact with him. The jade pendant in his pocket was given by Zhou Xinqi.</p>
<p>Xu Baocai coughed and despised him in the bottom of his heart. He did not dare to belittle Bai Xiaochun, so he began to smile bitterly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elder martial brother Bai, if these three people didn&rsquo;t have to start from the outer gate, they would have been the inner gate for a long time. However, all three of them are worthy of being the first in the outer gate in their respective mountains. Even the inner disciples are also afraid of them, because as long as they achieve their accomplishments and become the inner ones, they must be the best! For them, the inner gate is just a springboard, and their goal is to become the inheritor of our Lingxi sect! &quot;</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun is still a little unconvinced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zhou Xinqi is the spiritual pulse of plants and plants. In the future, it must be passed on to Li Cheng that he would become another pharmacist of Lingxi sect. However, LV Tianlei, who was poor when he was young, was as thin as firewood, but he had a rare Lei Lingmai. He practiced thunder Taoism on the purple tripod mountain. The headmaster himself said that he would be good in the future!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun was surprised that he was not just a man of practice at the moment. He knew a lot about the cultivation world. When he heard the words &ldquo;Lei Lingmai&rdquo;, he felt a little bit tasted. This kind of spiritual pulse can greatly increase the power of people&rsquo;s skills, and there are few obstacles to practice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is also the Shangguan Tianyou. He has the body of a sword spirit. There are even rumors that he is the reincarnation body of a sword cultivator. For some reason, the heaven is guilty, so he has countless blessings. When he is three years old, you can pick up the old broken sword. At the age of seven, the cub of a chiyun beast falls in the sky and recognizes him as the main one. At the age of 13, he is protected by golden light, so he is named Tianyou All of them have caused a stir to the supreme elder of the clan. &quot; When Xu Baocai saw that Bai Xiaochun finally appeared the expression of a normal person who knew these things, he said the third person.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaven is guilty!! Three years old What luck, what Or reincarnation? &quot; Bai Xiaochun opened her eyes and took a breath of anger. She made up her mind that she would never provoke Shangguan Tianyou, who was guilty to heaven.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These three people are bound to be able to build a foundation. Elder martial brother Bai, our friars, and miscellaneous servants become the outer gate. They are all said to be fish leaping over the dragon&rsquo;s gate. But in fact, when the condensation gas breaks through and steps into the foundation, it is the real fish leaping dragon&rsquo;s gate. From then on, their life levels are all different. Just as ordinary people get rid of vulgarity and embark on the road of true immortality, longevity will increase by one hundred years.&rdquo; Seeing Bai Xiaochun more and more surprised, Xu Baocai is satisfied. He can talk about building foundation, but sighs.</p>
<p>He is still sighing here. After hearing about the increase of one hundred years, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s eyes suddenly showed a strong light that had never been seen in his life. Even his body trembled for a moment, and his eyes turned red. He felt that his mind was buzzing and he grasped Xu Baocai&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said just now, after the foundation is built, you can add one hundred years of life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xu Baocai was stunned. Seeing that Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s eyes were bloodshot at the moment, he nodded in a hurry.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun breathed quickly. The whole person immediately walked around the yard, waving his hands as if he was grasping something. His eyes were shining. He looked like a mad man. He murmured in his mouth, and sometimes there was a terrible laugh.</p>
<p>Xu Baocai was even more frightened. He didn&rsquo;t know what was wrong with Bai Xiaochun. He just felt chilly behind his back. He quickly got up and said goodbye. Bai Xiaochun didn&rsquo;t pay attention to it. The whole person was like a demon.</p>
<p>Xu Baocai took a deep breath and felt that Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s appearance was more terrible, so he left quickly.</p>
<p>After a stick of incense, Bai Xiaochun put on her hair and suddenly stopped in the yard, taking a long breath and laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A hundred years!! Build a foundation, I must build a foundation! &quot;</p>
