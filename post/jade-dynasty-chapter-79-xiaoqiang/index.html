      <p>Above the hall, immortal daoxuan hasn&rsquo;t come back, but there are whispers among all the people.</p>
<p>When Shuiyue and his three disciples came back, they saw that they were separated, but Zhang Xiaofan was still kneeling on the ground alone. Lu Xueqi seemed to hesitate for a moment, but after Shuiyue&rsquo;s stern eyes swept over, she finally stood behind her in silence.</p>
<p>A moment later, immortal daoxuan came out of the back hall slowly and returned to his seat. The hall immediately became quiet.</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan didn&rsquo;t immediately ask Zhang Xiaofan. Instead, he apologized and said to the monk Puhong: &ldquo;elder martial brother Puhong, my disciples are rude, which makes elder martial brother laugh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Puhong smiled and said, &ldquo;what do you say, senior brother daoxuan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this time, Taoist Cangsong came over and took Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s fire stick in his hand and put it on the tea table next to Taoist Xuan. Taoist Xuan frowned slightly and looked at him with little doubt in his eyes.</p>
<p>Taoist Cangsong said in a low voice, &ldquo;elder martial brother, just after you left, the situation was a little chaotic. This matter has a great relationship. In case of any accident, I will put it away and put it back here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Daoxuan nodded and said, &ldquo;younger martial brother, I have a heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taoist Cangsong then retreated, and Taoist XuanZhen&rsquo;s eyes returned to Zhang Xiaofan again. All of them were nervous for a moment. They knew that the next moment was the moment to decide the fate of the young man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zhang Xiaofan, I&rsquo;ll ask you one last time. Do you have something to say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s forehead was covered with sweat, and now the situation is really bad to the extreme. It&rsquo;s just that he has been in Qingyun gate for many years and knows the taboo to spy on his secret fax method. If he really says it, he doesn&rsquo;t know how he&rsquo;ll end up. However, the general wisdom monk who has been in the earth for many years is afraid that more than his reputation will be damaged. Even the place where the bones are buried will be removed from the &ldquo;Shengsheng tower&rdquo; of Tianyin temple.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, monk Puzhi is one of the four God monks in Tianyin temple. Is it even more a question that people will believe in themselves?</p>
<p>He was fighting in his heart here. At that time, he thought of the general wisdom, voice and appearance, and at that time, he thought of the teacher&rsquo;s deep kindness. But if we want him to sell universal wisdom, we can&rsquo;t think clearly for a short time, just like forcing him to die.</p>
<p>Only, all the people above the hall. But I won&rsquo;t give him any more time.</p>
<p>Daoxuan saw Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s face was cloudy and clear after he listened to his questions. Although there were sweat on his forehead, he still didn&rsquo;t say a word. Then he thought of the situation when his disciples were begging for him. Deep inside, suddenly there was a nameless fire that had been sleeping for many years, and the bear was burning.</p>
<p>As if a hundred years ago, the white figure knelt on the Yuqing hall like this. In front of Sanqing deity, in front of all teachers and elders, and even in the course of all the people&rsquo;s bitter courtship, they are still so rebellious, so invincible, and look down upon the world.</p>
<p>Sitting in the last water moon, looking at the face of immortal daoxuan from afar, the body shook, a trace of sadness flashed in his eyes, and slowly lowered his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bang!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A loud noise. Everyone is shocked!</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan seems to have lost his patience at last. He stands up and angrily points to Zhang Xiaofan and says, &ldquo;you are so poor. Take you in Qingyun gate, but it&rsquo;s just to raise the tiger! &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan shook his body, raised his head, opened his mouth wide, and seemed to want to say something.</p>
<p>But immortal daoxuan looked like ice and frost, and said in a cold voice: &ldquo;if you don&rsquo;t get rid of your evil today. How can Qingyun gate explain to the world the right way? Well, let me finish you&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>The crowd lost color, and Tian could not easily stand up. Among them, Lu Xueqi, Tian linger, Lin Jingyu and other people were all white. It was the Puhong monk of Tianyin Temple sitting next to them, who seemed to be a little impatient. He whispered to daoxuan, &ldquo;brother daoxuan, do you think about it again&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taoist Xuan snorted and said coldly, &ldquo;this evil man is possessed of evil things of the demon sect, and he also violates my righteous taboo, which is very sinful.&rdquo; he said that he could easily pick up the fire stick placed on the tea table and said, &ldquo;today, I will let you die under the evil things of his demon sect&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s mind was filled with a buzz and a blank. It seemed that everything had lost its color in front of him. He was only at a loss when he saw daoxuan stretching out his arm. Shifu Tian was not easy to look blue. He seemed to be about to speak, but the disciples of Qingyun around him were in a mess.</p>
<p>Above the main hall, there will be five bloody steps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>All of a sudden, a loud shout shocked the whole audience. In the middle of the fright, it was Dao Xuan who was shivering and roaring. He threw the fire stick out like a hot hand.</p>
<p>The fire stick crossed a dark shadow in the air and fell to the ground. When it bounced back a few times, it rolled to Zhang Xiaofan.</p>
<p>At this time, people saw a dark shadow flying on the fire stick. After a while, they stopped in the air and made a strange sound.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a kind of heterogeneous centipede with the size of palm. It&rsquo;s colorful. There are seven bifurcations at the tail. At this moment, it vibrates and flies. It looks arrogant.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was stunned, his whole body suddenly trembled slightly, and his eyes were straight staring at the monster in the mid air, which was deeply branded in his memory: &ldquo;seven centipedes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a flash, time was like a torrent running back and roaring, bringing him to the black night many years ago, when general Zhi dueled with the mysterious man in black, and he lost all his bloody night at the same time!</p>
<p>His whole body trembled, and he was surrounded by the endless bloody breath in his deep heart. He stretched out his hand and held the firecracker tightly in his hand!</p>
<p>But at this time, no one noticed Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s unusual appearance. All people&rsquo;s eyes and attention were on Taoist immortal.</p>
<p>The first elders of Qingyun sect, whose experience is comparable to that of ordinary people, will be surrounded by immortal daoxuan in a blink of an eye, especially separated from the seven tailed centipede. When they look at immortal daoxuan, they will lose their color.</p>
<p>The right hand of immortal daoxuan was shaking, and there was a wound in the middle finger. Obviously, it was hurt by the seven centipedes. In this moment, the blood flowed out was black. What&rsquo;s more, from the wound of the finger end, a shocking black gas almost rushed up at a visible speed.</p>
<p>The seven tailed centipede is famous for its unique poisons. It is the Taoist immortal who is so good at it that he is trapped by it.</p>
<p>For a moment, immortal daoxuan felt dizzy and oppressed. However, he was so good at Taoism that he was better than the monk Puzhi. Immediately strong self-determination mind God, left hand and fingers such as knife, to only a moment almost numb right hand even points, flying symbols. At that time, he slowed down the attack of the black Qi.</p>
<p>At the moment, Taoist Cangsong rushed to his side, held him tightly, looked at Taoist Xuan&rsquo;s wound, turned to Zhang Xiaofan and shouted, &ldquo;Zhang Xiaofan, you are a bastard. How dare you harm the leader! &quot;</p>
<p>When everyone was shocked, Zhang Xiaofan lost his voice and said, &ldquo;no, it&rsquo;s not me&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taoist Xuan, surrounded by people, looks a little better now, but how poisonous the seven centipede is, it&rsquo;s on his face that he also faintly sees black Qi, thin but not scattered. However, his mind is still clear.</p>
<p>After breathing deeply, he said, &ldquo;take this evil man down quickly and interrogate him well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taoist Cangsong turned around and said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t worry, elder martial brother. I&rsquo;m here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan gasped for breath, but his heart fell in half, nodded, looked at him, and was about to say: &ldquo;then&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>His voice suddenly stopped, and Taoist Cangsong&rsquo;s face in front of his eyes. Suddenly from anxious look, become ferocious incomparable. Almost at the same time, the heart of immortal daoxuan was cold, and the sharp pain came in a moment. The body was shocked. The essence of the body, which was originally moved to the right hand to hold the poison, suddenly disappeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan roared and cut off his left hand. Taoist Cangsong immediately met him with his left hand and hit him. Taoist Cangsong&rsquo;s body was shocked. He flew out and landed in front of the Yuqing hall. A moment later, a bloodstain slowly flowed from the corner of his mouth, but he was sneering.</p>
<p>On top of his right hand, he held a short sword horizontally. It was as crystal as water. At a glance, he knew that it was not ordinary. At the moment, there are many bloodstains on the body of the sword, and the bright red blood trickles down from the blade to the green bricks on the hall.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, there was a dead silence among the confused crowd just now.</p>
<p>The dark green Taoist robe of immortal daoxuan has turned dark in the twinkling of an eye at the abdomen, and his whole face suddenly turns pale. However, the color of amazement on his face at the moment is far better than the pain on his body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You, what are you doing?&rdquo; In his hoarse voice, he asked all the questions to the Taoist Cangsong standing at the gate of the hall. At this moment, even Qi Hao and Lin Jingyu, the disciples of longshoufeng, could hardly believe their eyes. They opened their mouths and looked at the man who was once one of the most powerful people in Qingyun Mountain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me?&rdquo; Taoist Cangsong seems to have suddenly become another person, and he laughs wildly: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m plotting against you! Can&rsquo;t you see that? &quot; He said, with a move of his hand, the seven centipedes in the middle of the air immediately flew to him, and disappeared in his sleeve robe in an instant.</p>
<p>Qi Hao couldn&rsquo;t help it any more. His voice was confused and frightened. He shouted, &ldquo;master, are you crazy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taoist Cangsong gave him a look, and then his eyes fell to Lin Jingyu, who was standing beside Qi Hao but looked almost the same as him, and more disciples of longshoufeng, even other disciples of Qingyun sect, all looked at him with an unbelievable look like a madman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hahaha, are you crazy? Yeah! I&rsquo;ve been crazy! &quot; Taoist Cangsong looked up at the sky and laughed with a look of madness: &ldquo;as early as a hundred years ago, I was also in this Yuqing hall. When I saw the end of senior brother wanjian and 10000 senior brothers, I was crazy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master!&rdquo; The voices of Qi Hao and Lin Jingyu of dragon head peak have been crying at this moment. But behind them, the first elders of Qingyun sect around immortal daoxuan suddenly become stiff!</p>
<p>Wan Jianyi, as if with a nightmare like name, with a thick shadow, pressed on the sky of Qingyun gate.</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan&rsquo;s eyes twitched, a name that no one dared to mention in front of him for a hundred years, as if it had also deeply stimulated him. Xiao Yicai supported his body, but he suddenly found that Taoist Xuan&rsquo;s body suddenly shook violently. Even across the layer of clothes, he also felt that the flame that suddenly burned in his teacher&rsquo;s body was so burning!</p>
<p>Taoist Cangsong stood there crazily, as if the evil spirit accumulated in his heart for many years was finally released. For a while, no one came forward to catch the murderer who hurt the supreme leader of Qingyun sect.</p>
<p>He pointed to immortal daoxuan, and then pointed to the Sanqing God in the shadow behind the crowd, saying loudly: &ldquo;you, you,&rdquo; he pointed to the first Qingyun seat, such as Zhitian not easy, Shuiyue, Zeng Shuchang, Shang Zhengliang, etc. &ldquo;you all said to me conscientiously, who should be the leader? Is it senior brother Wan, or he? &quot;</p>
<p>No one answered. The young disciple was at a loss, but Tian could not easily wait for others, but their faces were livid and silent.</p>
<p>On the main hall, only Taoist Cangsong echoed like a crazy voice: &ldquo;how. Have you stopped talking? Do you feel guilty? Hahaha, yes! Yeah! In fact, who doesn&rsquo;t know what to do? But now, who are the people sitting in this seat? &quot;</p>
<p>Shuiyue&rsquo;s face was pale. He looked at Cangsong, who was different from his usual self, and said slowly: &ldquo;senior brother Cangsong. It&rsquo;s been over a hundred years. Why do you have to be so persistent? &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; At the moment, Taoist Cangsong, regardless of his own identity, gave a stern Pooh and sneered, &ldquo;over a hundred years? Yeah! I have endured for more than 100 years, and I have no chance to avenge elder martial brother Wan until today.</p>
<p>At that time, you, you, you were on a wild trip under the Qingyun gate! &quot;</p>
<p>He pointed one by one, and even pointed to Tian not easy, Zeng Shuchang and Shang Zhengliang. He sneered and said, &ldquo;you have been here for a hundred years. It&rsquo;s comfortable to be the first one, but remember when senior brother Wan desperate to save our lives? Can you still remember who was generous to share the experience with us so that we could make great progress? And you! &quot;</p>
<p>He pointed at Shuiyue and said coldly: &ldquo;you said that I was so persistent just now? Hehe, hehe, who didn&rsquo;t know that you were secretly in love with senior brother Wan, but later he saved you and loved you. Unexpectedly, he died and didn&rsquo;t save you on that day, but today he came to ridicule me! &quot;</p>
<p>The pale water moon!</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you, Tian is not easy!&rdquo; It&rsquo;s like trying to vent all the anger in my heart. Taoist Cangsong pointed at Tian hard with a wild laugh and said in a loud voice, &ldquo;you say to yourself, what did senior brother Wan do to you and how did you repay him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is not easy for a field to look blue. With his hands clenched tightly, his wife suru stood beside him, pale as usual, but they did not utter a word, leaving Taoist Cangsong to scold and laugh loudly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were just a common and wooden disciple under the gate of dazhufeng that day. Even your Shifu brothers look down on you. But when elder martial brother Wan met you, he recognized you as a man of ability. Since then, he has cultivated you with great care. He not only told you about his cultivation experience, but also recommended you to the wild five people&rsquo;s line. From then on, you can be a man of the moment in Qingyun sect and take this position today. Am I right? &quot;</p>
<p>It was not easy for Tian to breathe deeply. His face was mixed with pain. He said slowly from his mouth for a long time: &ldquo;elder martial brother Wan treats me very well. Even if I am broken, I can&rsquo;t repay you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as this remark came out, not only the disciples of dazhufeng, but also the people of Tianyin temple and burning incense Valley who were surprised by the chaos in Qingyun nearby, all changed their faces. It&rsquo;s obvious that even Tian is not easy to admit it. It can be seen that senior brother Wan in Cangsong road&rsquo;s population really has a secret.</p>
<p>Taoist Cangsong sneered and said, &ldquo;OK, OK, OK, you finally admit that you have a little conscience. Then how do you repay him? Say it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian uneasy slowly lowered his head and clenched his teeth, as if his body was trembling slightly.</p>
<p>Taoist Cangsong laughed wildly and said, &ldquo;OK, if you don&rsquo;t say it, I will say it for you.</p>
<p>You are a shameless person. Elder martial brother Wan paid so much attention to you. When you went back to Qingyun Mountain that day, you knew that elder martial brother Wan liked younger martial sister Su Ru Su of xiaozhufeng at that time, but you took over the love with all your might. What happened? &quot;</p>
<p>Tian could not easily raise his head, but as soon as he touched Taoist Cangsong&rsquo;s almost crazy eyes, the burning flame seemed to burn in it. Somehow, he felt that there was a white figure standing behind Taoist Cangsong. He could not speak at once, and then slowly lowered his head.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t speak, but Su Ru beside him suddenly took a step and said in a loud voice: &ldquo;elder martial brother Cangsong, if you have something, you will come to me! In those days, senior brother Wan really had a heart for me, but I respected and loved him from the beginning to the end. He is very kind to both of us, but it&rsquo;s not easy for me to get along with him. It&rsquo;s all my own meaning, and I can&rsquo;t say that he takes love with a knife. And in those days, senior brother Wan himself was in front of the two of us. He blessed the two of us personally. &quot;</p>
<p>Taoist Cangsong sneered and said: &ldquo;how proud is elder martial brother Wan. After being betrayed by both of you, how can he be like a layman? He would rather be sad than be seen. &quot;</p>
<p>Speaking of this, he seemed to be reluctant to go on, staring at the wounded immortal daoxuan, with endless hatred in his eyes, saying: &ldquo;in those days, senior brother Wan was like a father to me, he cultivated me, and even saved me in the wilderness. My life had been given to him for a long time! Hatefully, a hundred years ago, I tried my best not to save him. After that, I told myself that I would avenge him anyway! &quot;</p>
<p>At the end of the sentence, he shouted out in a hoarse voice, as if to his deep heart, as if to those eyes in the dark.</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai&rsquo;s face faded, but what surprised him even more was the body he supported, which suddenly pushed him away.</p>
<p>The real leader of Qingyun sect, the supreme leader in the world &lsquo;.</p>
<p>His momentum, for a moment covered up all the people, the dark green robe flying without wind, faintly saw his hands, deeply clenched his fist, even his fingernails also fell into the flesh.</p>
<p>He looked at the front, straightened up, facing Taoist Cangsong, more like facing the invisible white figure, and laughed loudly: &ldquo;well, I can&rsquo;t imagine that the public case in those days made you remember it so much.</p>
<p>You come here to have a try and see if I am worthy of being the leader! &quot;</p>
<p>He squinted to see Cang song. Suddenly, his hands sprang out of his clenched fist. From the wound of his right hand, a drop of black blood gushed out, and the black air on his face gradually faded. But his face was paler, but his voice was shrill, with a trace of disdain: &ldquo;by your side?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taoist Cangsong burst out laughing and said, &ldquo;yes, you are powerful. At that time, under Qingyun gate, senior brother Wan and you were the peerless two arrogants. I am not your opponent, but someone will clean you up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan looked solemn and said coldly, &ldquo;who is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the main hall, everyone held their breath, and the disciples of Qingyun sect looked at each other. However, they were embarrassed to see the chaos of Tianyin temple and burning incense valley.</p>
<p>Taoist Cangsong laughed all the time. At this time, suddenly, from a far away place outside Yuqing hall, there came a thick voice: &ldquo;Taoist Xuan old friend, I haven&rsquo;t seen you for a hundred years. It&rsquo;s gratifying to see you look like you used to be!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sound was like thunder. In a moment, there was a sudden sound of killing outside the Tianfeng mountain. The mountain front was in a mess. In the sound of panic, someone seemed to shout from afar: &ldquo;demon sect demon man killed and came to the mountain!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the people in Qingyun sect lost their color. Immortal daoxuan took a breath of cool air and pointed to Taoist Cangsong. He almost couldn&rsquo;t believe that he said: &ldquo;you dare to betray the school and collude with the devil cult!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taoist Cangsong said with a wild laugh: &ldquo;yes, I am colluding with the demon sect, so what! In my opinion, the Qingyun sect is better than the demon sect in hiding evil! In order to avenge elder martial brother Wan, I don&rsquo;t care if I go to hell, let alone collude with the devil cult. &quot;</p>
<p>Su Ru&rsquo;s face was pale, and she whispered, &ldquo;crazy, crazy, he&rsquo;s really crazy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian was hard to hear and looked grim. He knew that Taoist Cangsong had great power in Qingyun gate over the years, and he was also responsible for the daily defense. Today, when the demon cult came to kill, it was almost to Yuqing hall that it was discovered. The situation was so bad that it could not be further improved.</p>
<p>In a flash, he saw a mess. Zhang Xiaofan, his little apprentice, was standing there holding the fire stick. He took advantage of others&rsquo; inattention and pulled him behind him. But in a flash, he found that his little apprentice was not right.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s eyes were red, and he stared at Taoist Cangsong&rsquo;s figure. He seemed to say something in his mouth: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s him, it&rsquo;s him, it must be him&hellip;&rdquo; (to be continued. )</p>
