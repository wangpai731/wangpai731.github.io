      <p>Zhongtu, twenty miles outside Heyang city.</p>
<p>The sky is getting dark, and the pedestrians on the ancient road are gradually disappearing. In times of chaos, demons are in vogue. Although it is said that at the foot of Qingyun Gate Mountain, the giant of the right way, no one can say whether they will suddenly encounter any monsters or ghosts.</p>
<p>Everyone has only one life. Even ordinary people cherish their own lives. What&rsquo;s more, when the monster catastrophe just passed, people who survived after the disaster naturally cherish themselves more.</p>
<p>However, after all, there are still a few figures, very conspicuous walking on the road, an old man in the front of the line, daoguxianfeng, holding a bamboo pole with an old cloth hanging on it, with the words &ldquo;immortal guiding the way&rdquo;. After a man and a woman, the man&rsquo;s turban mask, the woman&rsquo;s beautiful and lovely, although the sky is dark, but still seems to concentrate on the hand of a black book with no word cover.</p>
<p>Of course, it&rsquo;s Monday fairy, Xiao Huan and wild dog Taoist.</p>
<p>Along the way, they procrastinate. From time to time, Zhouxian looks for passers-by to pull aside, and makes a lot of nonsense. Xiaohuan and the wild dog Taoist can&rsquo;t even see it. However, those who are drawn to fortune telling by him are really as Zhou Yixian said before. After being counted by him, their spirits are greatly improved. After paying, they seem to be rejuvenated and happy Gone.</p>
<p>After that, he was full of money on Monday, but Xiaohuan didn&rsquo;t care about it. He just read books. Over the past few days, Xiao Huan has become more and more fascinated by the book which records the mysterious skills of ghost road left by Mr. GUI that day. He not only often reads it when he is resting, but also can&rsquo;t put it down when he walks. Now it was dark, but she did not seem to notice the appearance, is still devoted to books.</p>
<p>Next to him, the wild dog Taoist said, &ldquo;master, today we can&rsquo;t get to Heyang city again. If we can&rsquo;t find someone else, we&rsquo;ll have to sleep in the wild.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Monday fairy looked at the sky and nodded. Then he looked around, but he could see that it was dark all around. Not to mention any other people living outside the wilderness, there were no dilapidated temples and dilapidated houses.</p>
<p>Monday fairy coughed. However, the Taoist priest of wild dog looked at him, and his granddaughter Xiaohuan didn&rsquo;t react at all. She still followed the Taoist priest and devoted herself to reading the Black Ghost book. Zhou Yixian had always thought that it was not appropriate for her granddaughter to read the book of ghosts, but it was hard to say what was wrong.</p>
<p>Every time he said how cruel the ghost road is, it&rsquo;s the art of evil and evil spirits. Xiao Huan sent him away with a word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are many ways to save people in this evil art, which is better than your physiognomy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhou Yixian often heard this, but he couldn&rsquo;t say anything because he was thick skinned and refused to admit defeat. However, if he wanted Xiaohuan to lose the ghost Road, he couldn&rsquo;t speak any more.</p>
<p>In any case, Zhou Daxian looked at Xiaohuan anyway, and it was very unpleasant to look at the book. At the moment, he was even more angry and said, &ldquo;Xiaohuan. When is it? Why are you still reading that book</p>
<p>Xiaohuan then lifted his head from the book and looked at Zhouxian. He said impatiently, &ldquo;grandfather, we are walking so slowly. It&rsquo;s not for me to read books. It&rsquo;s you who show people fortune telling and money cheating, so it&rsquo;s so slow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Monday, the immortal smothered for a while, his face turned red, he coughed twice and turned his head. Dry smile way: &ldquo;forget it, forget it, we don&rsquo;t say this, I mean. We don&rsquo;t have a place to live now. We have to find a way. &quot;</p>
<p>The wild dog Taoist shook his head and said, &ldquo;you really can&rsquo;t find someone else to stay here. Elder, you are more familiar with this place than we are. If you think of any broken temple or other places nearby, we can deal with the night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Monday fairy snorted. Sneering, &ldquo;how do you know that I am familiar with this place again? Although I was born in Heyang city since I was a child, I have always wandered around the world. When did I get familiar with it Eh</p>
<p>He was suddenly thoughtful and stopped in the middle of his speech.</p>
<p>Xiaohuan and the wild dog Taoist were both strange. Xiaohuan said, &ldquo;what do you want to say, grandfather?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Monday fairy frowned, as if thinking of something but not sure, slowly turned to look at the front, as if trying to recall what.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That It seems to me that there is a fork in the road not far ahead. It is a little far from that path, but there is a room there</p>
<p>Xiaohuan and the wild dog Taoist were all happy. Xiaohuan said with a smile: &ldquo;really! Then what are we waiting for? Go</p>
<p>Zhouxian did not know why, but he seemed hesitant. He frowned all the time and tried to think about something. He said, &ldquo;but I always feel something wrong in my heart. It has been too long. I only vaguely remember that there is a room in this direction outside Heyang City, but it seems that it is not a good place.</p>
<p>But what it is, I can&rsquo;t remember&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan gave him a look. He left first and ignored him. He said, &ldquo;well, let&rsquo;s go. At least there&rsquo;s a room. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if it&rsquo;s broken. At least it&rsquo;s better than sleeping in the open.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan left first, and the wild dog Taoist also followed.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, he couldn&rsquo;t help but follow him. But he kept patting his head with his hand, frowning and saying something in his mouth, he said, &ldquo;what kind of room is it? I just can&rsquo;t remember it</p>
<p>After walking a long way, the sky was completely dark, but with the help of a few faint starlight in the sky, the three found a nearly hidden path by the road leading to the deep wilderness.</p>
<p>Small ring and wild dog Taoist both nodded and walked up the path. The wild dog Taoist also quickened his pace. He walked in front of the small ring and looked around with vigilance. Only Zhou Yixian was still at the end, muttering with complaints from time to time. It seemed that he still couldn&rsquo;t remember what the origin and use of the room in my memory.</p>
<p>This path is actually very long. After walking for half an hour, they haven&rsquo;t seen any sign of a house. Xiaohuan is suspicious and looks back to the fairy on Monday and says, &ldquo;grandfather, are you sure you remember correctly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhou Yixian was taken a look by Xiaohuan, but he felt guilty. He said with a dry smile: &ldquo;this This You know, when people are old, sometimes they will remember something wrong. But I really remember that there was a house on this road, but I can&rsquo;t remember what the house was for. What&rsquo;s more, it&rsquo;s possible that the house has been demolished over the years. Even if it hasn&rsquo;t been demolished, it&rsquo;s possible that it will collapse. &quot;</p>
<p>Xiao Huan couldn&rsquo;t speak for a moment. He shook his head and turned around.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, the wild dog Taoist stood up, then turned back and cried out, &ldquo;come on, the house is here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Huan and Monday fairy are both stunned. Zhou Yixian was immediately overjoyed and said with a loud smile, &ldquo;ah ha, I&rsquo;ll tell you! With the wisdom of this immortal, how can you not remember that there is a house here? How can you remember it wrong</p>
<p>Xiao Huan ignored him. Walking quickly to the wild dog Taoist, looking forward, you can see that there is a house at the end of the path. It covers an area of a large area. It is only seen from a distance that the courtyard is deserted and the walls are damaged. It is not popular at all. Obviously, it has been abandoned for many years.</p>
<p>Monday fairy came slowly. Shaking head, mouth tut sound, seems to be still boasting.</p>
<p>Small ring white his one eye, angry way: &ldquo;go quickly! Grandfather</p>
<p>Xiaohuan said that, three people walked to the house, the night wind blowing, some cold on the wilderness, three people all shrink their necks.</p>
<p>When you get closer, you can see more clearly that this is a dilapidated house. The original wall collapsed and broken to pieces, even the courtyard gate was left with a worn-out door frame, even the door panel. As for the courtyard, there is only one room. From the outside, the roof above seemed to be half empty, and even the crossbeams were exposed. There seems to be a door in the room, which is not covered. The whole house looks like it is made of wood. After being eroded by wind and rain, a musty smell comes with the wind.</p>
<p>Little ring frowned. But Monday fairy was quite happy. He slowly walked into the yard and looked around. Although there were weeds, there was no other strange place. It seems that although he still can&rsquo;t remember what kind of house it is, it should not be dangerous at least.</p>
<p>He turned back to greet Xiao Huan and the wild dog Taoist to come in.</p>
<p>Xiaohuan walked to Monday fairy, hesitated for a moment, and suddenly turned to the wild dog Taoist: &ldquo;Taoist priest, do you think that we have seen the layout of this room</p>
<p>The Taoist priest was stunned and looked around for a long time. He didn&rsquo;t know why, so he shook his head to show that he didn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Monday fairy impatiently said: &ldquo;what do you remember? This room is so old that I can&rsquo;t even remember your grandfather. Do you still see it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan shrugged his shoulders and said, &ldquo;yes, forget it. Let&rsquo;s go in and have a look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Monday, the immortal laughed, waved and said, &ldquo;go.&rdquo; After that, he took the two people to the stone steps in front of the house and opened the door with a squeak.</p>
<p>Just as Monday immortal stood at the door and peeped into the dark room, Xiaohuan suddenly felt that he was moving and touched something. Looking down, he saw that it was a shabby black card with handwriting on it. A moment of curiosity, he squatted down, pulled the black wooden card out of the ruins, pulled away the debris, and looked carefully.</p>
<p>After a moment, Xiao Huan&rsquo;s body suddenly trembled, even stepped back a few steps, even his face turned pale and a little angry. He said in a loud voice, &ldquo;grandfather, what is this place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The immortal turned back in astonishment. Obviously, although he had been looking around for a long time, the inner room was too dark for him to see clearly for a moment. He said, &ldquo;what! Little ring? &quot;</p>
<p>Small ring a point at his feet, angry way: &ldquo;you see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Monday immortal looked down and looked at the wooden card carefully. He was stunned, shook his head, wiped his eyes with his hand, looked again, and suddenly &ldquo;ah&rdquo; cried out and jumped down from the stone steps. He was strong and vigorous, and did not look like an old man at all.</p>
<p>On that black card, although the handwriting is a little fuzzy, it can still be identified as &ldquo;Yizhuang&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Xiaohuan, angry and afraid, said to the immortal on Monday: &ldquo;you What road did you take that brought us to such a place. You did this once in Heyang city last time</p>
<p>Zhou Yixian&rsquo;s face was red and white, and he was extremely embarrassed. He said, &ldquo;well, this old man said that. I really only remember that there is a house here, but I really can&rsquo;t remember what it is used for. It turns out that it is&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Small ring &ldquo;bah&rdquo; a, interrupted his words, way: &ldquo;you talk more, what more to say, go quickly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, let&rsquo;s go. Every time we meet We all have bad luck in this kind of place Eh</p>
<p>He was turning around in a hurry. When he was talking, he suddenly stopped. The little ring and the wild dog Taoist priest who followed him almost hit him.</p>
<p>Xiaohuan poked his head out of his back and said angrily, &ldquo;what are you doing, Grandpa?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her voice suddenly stopped.</p>
<p>At this moment, in the night of dark moon and high wind, under the light of a few stars, before the ghost house in the wilderness. On Monday, the three fairies stood in amazement. They saw a figure standing in front of them, just in front of the courtyard gate.</p>
<p>The man is quite tall. The cloth of the clothes seems to be quite good, but the whole body is extremely dirty, and the Jumpsuit is also broken several places. It can only be seen that it seems to be dark green originally. Look at the style. It seems to be a Taoist robe worn by monks.</p>
<p>Somehow, the man&rsquo;s face seemed to be in the shadow all the time. The three people, including Zhouxian, couldn&rsquo;t see his face clearly. However, the man appeared quietly behind them, almost like ghosts. A cool breath rose from behind them.</p>
<p>For a long time, the man stood motionless like a stone, but Zhou Yixian and others were even more frightened. They actually came from this figure. There was no breath of life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You Who the hell are you? &quot; The voice slightly trembles, but finally small ring slowly opened his mouth and asked.</p>
<p>The man did not respond, let alone answer, but a moment later, the shadow over his face suddenly ignited two faint dark red lights, as if a pair of strange eyes were staring at the person in front of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah</p>
<p>Suddenly. Zhou Yixian gave out a light cry. Xiaohuan and the wild dog Taoist priest were both frightened. In a twinkling of an eye, Zhou Yixian did not look at the man&rsquo;s face. Instead, he looked at the man&rsquo;s arm and said, &ldquo;that, that&rsquo;s the sign of Qingyun gate&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A hundred thousand mountains, an ancient cave.</p>
<p>The darkness seems to be endless, blocking in front of the ghost and the Golden Vase. They walked for a long time, but it seemed that the road would never end. It&rsquo;s just weird. It seems that there is only one road in this ancient cave, and there is no other side road, which avoids the worry of getting lost.</p>
<p>Since passing the black bat, there have been one or several powerful monsters guarding the ancient cave at regular intervals, some of which even moved the Golden Vase. But at this moment, GUI Li showed his strength that he had never had before. He killed him directly and almost no monster could stop his attack. Even the little grey monkey with three eyes was so powerful that it was shocking. The fate of the black bat also happened to several other powerful monsters.</p>
<p>Jin pinger didn&rsquo;t do anything along the way, but her face became more and more ugly. The high and rapid progress of the evil way was far beyond her imagination. Even at the end of the day, she thought to herself, is there anyone in the demon sect who can be compared with this person?</p>
<p>The brilliant ghost king? Or the secret ghost?</p>
<p>At the moment, Guili just in front of the Golden Vase son, he struck a ferocious double headed devil leopard, and the huge animal body hit the hard stone wall heavily. It seemed that it was more or less ominous.</p>
<p>GUI Li didn&rsquo;t take a look at the leopard. He continued to walk forward. The little ash on his shoulder seemed to be full of energy and looked around. The golden jar followed them and passed by the two headed magic leopards. They turned around to see the leopard&rsquo;s body. The body was thick and dry. It seemed that the essence of the body had been sucked away, and this was naturally the result of the blood sucking beads.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that these demons are extremely powerful creatures. Even if the ghost has a soul eating magic stick in his hand, he will kill such a huge monster in a moment. This practice is almost not high-quality, but terrible.</p>
<p>When did this man begin to do so by leaps and bounds!</p>
<p>Jin pinger&rsquo;s heart is more and more startled, and his eyes are more and more complicated. At this moment, all of a sudden, the ghost&rsquo;s body stopped, and some vigilance appeared on his face.</p>
<p>Jin Ping&rsquo;er was stunned for a moment. Although there were many monsters guarding the whole way, he had never seen such a cautious look. At the moment, he immediately concentrated on his guard and found that something was wrong with him.</p>
<p>After the death of the double headed demon leopard, the usual silence here was restored. But now in the invisible darkness, there was a deep and deep song: xiaosonggang, the moon is like frost, people are like flocculent flowers are also injured. For more than ten years and three thousand years, I hope we don&rsquo;t forget each other</p>
<p>The song was sad and sad. Although it didn&rsquo;t sound very loud, it somehow penetrated into my ears. Word by word, it was very clear. At first I heard the song, it seemed very desolate, and then my mood was sad, as if in the dark, I followed the singer through three thousand years to relive the unknown but beautiful tenderness.</p>
<p>Time is like a knife, warm your heart, is not only a pair of light smile eyes?</p>
<p>Did you forget?</p>
<p>Many years later, or another cycle of vicissitudes?</p>
<p>What do you remember?</p>
<p>The blank emptiness is like a memory, staring at the dark, distant.</p>
<p>Once, have I ever hugged?</p>
<p>And you.</p>
<p>Monkey small ash suddenly &ldquo;squeak&rdquo; called, seems to be very happy appearance, unexpectedly jumped down from the ghostly shoulder, whoosh into the dark. (to be continued. )</p>
