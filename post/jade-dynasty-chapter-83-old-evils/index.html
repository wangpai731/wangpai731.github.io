      <p>They made a mess and helped immortal daoxuan into the Yuqing palace. However, at this moment, the Yuqing palace is already in a state of disrepair. At this moment, more than half of the original majestic buildings collapsed, and there are broken stones and wood everywhere.</p>
<p>Tian is not easy to wait for young disciples to quickly organize a space, drag a chair from the side, and let immortal daoxuan sit down. There is any magic medicine on the heads of the elders around. It&rsquo;s too late to take it out. I wish it had been swallowed by daoxuan all of a sudden.</p>
<p>After a while, daoxuan&rsquo;s body moved, and he woke up slowly with a long gasp.</p>
<p>Tian can&rsquo;t wait for someone to see that Taoist Xuan&rsquo;s face is pale and almost without blood color, especially the wound on his abdomen. When did the coagulated blood stain expand several times, and almost blackened the whole lower part of the Taoist robe, everyone could not help but look worried.</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan obviously hurt his vitality. When he woke up, he couldn&rsquo;t even speak at once. Tian can&rsquo;t help but take three of his refined Dahuang pills to him. After a while, the power of the pills will be released, and immortal daoxuan&rsquo;s face will be better.</p>
<p>At this time, the surrounding elders and disciples all gathered around. Lin Jingyu, Zhang Xiaofan, Lu Xueqi and other people also arrived here. When they saw the real head hurt so badly, they couldn&rsquo;t help but lose their color.</p>
<p>After a while, song Daren, Qi Hao and others came back.</p>
<p>Taoist Xuan&rsquo;s spirit recovered a little. He opened his eyes and saw that Tian could not wait to look at himself anxiously. Then he forced a smile and said, &ldquo;I can still hold on. I can do something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian not easy and others were relieved. Some of them thought of the legendary ancient sword, Zhuxian, but saw that immortal daoxuan had empty hands and did not see the trace of Zhuxian. Outside the Yuqing hall, the spirit beast, water Qilin, did not return to the clear water pool, but lay there, but there was no shadow of Zhuxian ancient sword near it.</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan slowly looked around, his face slightly changed, only to see the people in the Qingyun gate standing around. Almost half less than half, surprised: &ldquo;just after I left, how about casualties here and here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Standing in the nearest field, he hesitated for a moment and said in a low voice: &ldquo;chief senior brother. You&rsquo;d better take care of the injury first&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say it!&rdquo; said daoxuan</p>
<p>Tian was not easy to smother for a moment, turned around and looked around, as if to confirm again, and then whispered casualties to daoxuan.</p>
<p>In this war, Qingyun sect really suffered heavy casualties. Under the siege of the demon cult.</p>
<p>Twenty five elders died in the war, and four or five were seriously injured. They were the seven vessel head. In addition to the leader Taoist XuanZhen, the Taoist Cangsong of dragon head peak betrayed him. The first shangzhengliang of Chaoyang peak and the first Tianyun Taoist of Luoxia peak unfortunately died. The remaining Tian and fenghuifeng&rsquo;s first Zeng Shuchang were also full of wounds. Only the master Shuiyue of xiaozhufeng was escorted Master Puhong of Tianyin temple and others. It doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan&rsquo;s body swayed, dangerous and unable to support. Qingyun gate was proud of its strength in the past. In this war, it was almost lost.</p>
<p>Tian was not easy to feel sad and angry on his face. He whispered: &ldquo;master, elder martial brother, we must take revenge for such a deep hatred. But you must not be too sad because your body is very important at the moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a long sigh, daoxuan closed his eyes and stepped on his feet. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to be the founder of Qingyun sect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His voice is bleak. All the people listened to the unspeakable pain and were silent for a while.</p>
<p>At this time, next to the ruins. A piece of wood suddenly fell down with a plop, and a head stuck out from the corner of the ruins. Everyone was shocked and looked at it intently, but they were all shocked. This man was Wang Er Shu who had been crazy for many years. I don&rsquo;t know when he will run into the Yuqing hall. But in the earth shaking war just now, he didn&rsquo;t know where to hide. This time, he crawled out like this. He was dusty and ashen, but he didn&rsquo;t seem to be very afraid and giggled.</p>
<p>At this time, Zhang Xiaofan and Lin Jingyu, who were standing by, walked by at the same time. After all, they had a very close relationship with Uncle Wang. Lin Jingyu pulled him aside and examined him. Sure enough, except for a few bruises, he was safe and sound. This road is better than countless Qingyun disciples who are thousands of times higher than him.</p>
<p>They took a long breath and looked at each other with a fluke in their eyes. Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s mood has calmed down a little at the moment, as if the ferocity in his body is calming down with the departure of Taoist Cangsong, especially the fight with the man in black of the demon sect just now in the back mountain.</p>
<p>As soon as he thought of this, he seemed to think of something and looked at the other end involuntarily. I saw Lu Xueqi, who had just witnessed his ferocity, standing there in silence with his face as heavy as water, and didn&rsquo;t know what he was thinking?</p>
<p>The devil cult people fought to kill and opened a blood path. They rushed out of the sword array of killing immortals launched by immortal daoxuan and escaped to Tongtian peak.</p>
<p>At the foot of Qingyun Mountain, the ghost King first calmed down and stopped the frightened people. At present, the four major factions re counted their personnel. A moment later, the ghost king, poison God, yuyangzi and sanmiaoshi came together and looked at each other speechless.</p>
<p>Qingyun gate was seriously injured, and the devil cult was not easy.</p>
<p>Since the defeat of the demon sect a hundred years ago, all the people in the demon sect have made great efforts in the past few years. Today, the four sects in the total strength of the demon sect have surpassed any of the three great sects in the right way. Unexpectedly, in today&rsquo;s World War I, not to mention later, immortal daoxuan launched the Zhuxian sword array. First, in the Yuqing hall, there were more than ten people who died together with the elder of Qingyun sect. Later, more than ten people died under the Zhuxian sword array. Many disciples were killed in all four factions, which caused great losses.</p>
<p>At the moment, Taoist Cangsong also came to stand with them because of his special identity.</p>
<p>Yuyangzi was arrogant and angry at the casualties under the door. He looked at him coldly, turned his head and drove away without giving him any face.</p>
<p>Taoist Cangsong&rsquo;s face changed a little, but the ghost King&rsquo;s city was very deep. He was well-trained and even smiled. He said: &ldquo;Taoist Cangsong, your strength of Qingyun sect is really unpredictable. This array of killing immortal swords is even more capable, powerful and powerful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taoist Cangsong shook his head and said to the ghost king, &ldquo;Lord ghost, I&rsquo;m afraid you don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;m afraid that the sword array just used to kill the immortal has only half its power.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; The three wonderful fairies standing beside cried out in silence. Taoist Cangsong looked at her, and suddenly his mind wandered. I saw that beautiful woman&rsquo;s skin was like a frost. During the war just now, I saw that her face was expressionless and ferocious. But now I saw that under the frost expression, I suddenly found that she was even more charming and attractive. She was stunned at the moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cough!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poison God coughed twice. After all, Taoist Cangsong has been practicing Taoism for many years. He woke up and realized that these three wonderful fairies, as the patriarch of Hehuan sect, really have the skill of seduction. With no trace, it&rsquo;s very unusual to be a gorgeous woman.</p>
<p>At present, he dared not look at the three wonderful fairies, but said: &ldquo;although I have never seen the sword array used to kill fairies before, it was recorded in the ancient books of Qingyun gate that when the founder of Qingye was at his peak.</p>
<p>With the demon sect Well, when fighting against the holy religion, the sword array of killing immortals is deployed. Except for the huge seven color main sword across the sky, the other six color Qi swords are listed according to the orientation of the six peaks, and the range is wide. They surround the seven peaks of the whole Qingyun Mountain Range, and the power of falling sword rain is not that we can barely resist today! &quot;</p>
<p>The ghost king was silent for a moment. With a long breath, he sighed, &ldquo;you green leaf guru are really amazing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The poison God frowned and said, &ldquo;that is to say, the power of the sword array is so great that we are afraid that it will be hard to crack it all our lives?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost King shook his head, but smiled: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poison God and others looked over together, said: &ldquo;how, ghost King brother, do you have any opinion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost king said lightly: &ldquo;in the view of today&rsquo;s war. Although daoxuan can master the ancient sword of killing immortals and urge the array of killing immortals, it is obviously reluctant, and the power of the array is greatly reduced. Secondly, the power of the sword array is so huge. Is it idle to expend the power of essence? I&rsquo;m sure that daoxuan&rsquo;s old wound will recur at the moment. Even if he doesn&rsquo;t die, he will die! &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not bad!&rdquo; However, the voice of harmony was not made by poisonous gods and others, but by yuyangzi coming back again. After hearing this, he couldn&rsquo;t help saying it.</p>
<p>Poison God looks at the ghost king with his eyes. His face suddenly changed and he said, &ldquo;brother ghost king, do you want to&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost king said decidedly: &ldquo;yes, I am going back to Qingyun! At this moment, it&rsquo;s the most vulnerable moment of Qingyun gate since Qingye. If we don&rsquo;t take this opportunity to get rid of our serious troubles, when will we stay? Moreover, Qingyun gate did not know that we had just rushed out of the dead place and dared to kill again. It was also a surprise that we would win the whole battle! &quot;</p>
<p>All the people in the surrounding demon sect changed color for a while. However, the poison God, who had seen countless people in the world, was shocked by the words of the ghost king.</p>
<p>The ghost king looked around and said: &ldquo;today is a good time for us to have a hundred years of holy shame. You have made a vow with me before the throne of Notre Dame. Why don&rsquo;t you fight hard today?&rdquo;</p>
<p>People in the demon sect look at each other. Naturally, these people are not cowards. But just a moment ago, they escaped from Qingyun Mountain. Now they are going back to the mountain again. It&rsquo;s hard for us to accept the courage of the ghost king, or to ignore the idea of life and death at all.</p>
<p>For a while, no one responded.</p>
<p>The ghost King&rsquo;s face gradually became ugly, and finally he shook his head and sighed: &ldquo;great opportunity, wait Alas! &quot; After that, he sighed a long time. His face seemed to be frustrated. He walked slowly back to where his disciples were.</p>
<p>Qinglong, Youji and others came up. Qinglong was trying to say something. The ghost King smiled bitterly and said in a low voice, &ldquo;not enough and plan, not enough and plan!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, he sighed and said, &ldquo;well, let&rsquo;s talk about it in the future. Let&rsquo;s go back to the mountain until today Well, where&rsquo;s Baguio? &quot;</p>
<p>As soon as the words came out, Qinglong and Youji were shocked. Youji was covered with black gauze and couldn&rsquo;t see her look. But when listening to the voice, it was obvious that they were shocked. They said: &ldquo;at that time, in Yuqing hall, we fought with Qingyun gate. Biyao said to both of us that they would go to find you, didn&rsquo;t they&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost King&rsquo;s face changed greatly. He said in a hurry, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen her since I went up the mountain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Dragon lost his voice and said, &ldquo;is she still on Qingyun Mountain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a little sweat on the ghost King&rsquo;s forehead for a moment. Then he decided, &ldquo;Yao&rsquo;er is my own flesh and blood. I can&rsquo;t leave him alone. I&rsquo;ll go to Qingyun Mountain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Green Dragon said in a hurry, &ldquo;master, never, this, this, this is&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost King&rsquo;s eyes flashed quickly, his heart suddenly turned around, and he shouted at the evil spirits and other people: &ldquo;you guys, my mind has been determined. For the sake of snow, my holy religion has been shamed for a hundred years. Zongning, the ghost king, can be crushed to pieces, and also can stand up to the virgin. At the moment, the death and injury of Qingyun gate, and the old thief of the leader daoxuan are seriously injured and nearly dead, so he can&rsquo;t use the sword array to kill the immortal. Our ghost King clan will kill and return to the mountain. If we succeed, we will be blessed by the virgin. If we are outnumbered, we will die at the top of Qingyun Mountain. In the future, under the spring, we will visit the virgin. We should have a clear conscience! &quot;</p>
<p>After all, the ghost king didn&rsquo;t even look at the people. When you fly first, you are sure to go to Qingyun Mountain. Qinglong and Youji look at each other and keep up with each other. Later, the disciples of the ghost King sect don&rsquo;t talk much. One after another, only the stunned poison God and other demons stood in the same place.</p>
<p>After a while, poison God and others returned to God, but did not wait for them to speak. Only to hear behind the devil sect, gradually rising noise. Poison God and others secretly cried in their hearts. Looking back, they saw that most of them were angry.</p>
<p>On the top of the sky peak of Qingyun Mountain, there is a heavy atmosphere now. A group of people wait around immortal daoxuan and comfort him in a low voice.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu and Zhang Xiaofan stand aside, tidy up the clothes for Uncle Wang, and beat the dust off his body. Uncle Wang seems to have some impression on them. Standing there motionless, at their mercy, their eyes only looked out at the water unicorn, he he giggled.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan looks at him, his heart is sour, he can&rsquo;t help but think of the old things of that year, sighs a long time, Lin Jingyu listens to it, touches his mind and feels the same. Reach out and pat Zhang Xiaofan on the shoulder.</p>
<p>When they looked at each other, they could see the sadness in each other&rsquo;s eyes. They were speechless for a while.</p>
<p>At this time, master Puhong and others were escorted to a safe place by master Shuiyue. Also sent back by Shuiyue. But when I saw master Puhong&rsquo;s face at the moment, it was much whiter than that just now. I think Zhou Yin&rsquo;s departure cone, though powerful, was much worse than master Puhong&rsquo;s great Brahma Prajna.</p>
<p>In this period of time, master Puhong has gradually forced the eccentric stabbing force out of the body by more than half. But Rao is so, master Puhong is still weak. Soon someone moved a chair nearby. Master Puhong sat beside immortal daoxuan with the help of FA Xiang and Pukong.</p>
<p>Master Puhong gasped a few times and looked around, but there was blood flowing everywhere. There were dead people and broken halls. He sighed and said: &ldquo;Amitabha!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan nodded to master Puhong and said with a wry smile, &ldquo;how is your injury?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Puhong shook his head and said, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t die, but the real leader needs to take care of me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan shook his head and sighed, looked at the distance, and suddenly fell to Zhang Xiaofan, who was standing outside. It seemed that he remembered something. Turning his head to Tian was not easy: &ldquo;Tian Shidi, you call your apprentice Zhang Xiaofan to come here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian didn&rsquo;t change his face easily, but he didn&rsquo;t dare to disobey his life, so he turned around and said, &ldquo;seven, come here. The real leader has something to say to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that time, everyone was shocked, especially the disciples of dazhufeng. Zhang Xiaofan was shocked, but his life was hard to disobey, so he had to go there with a stiff head.</p>
<p>A moment later, the crowd scattered a vacant lot. Zhang Xiaofan stood alone in front of Taoist immortal Xuan and whispered, &ldquo;headmaster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After seeing him for a long time, immortal daoxuan whispered, &ldquo;are you still unwilling to tell your secret now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s body shakes. He only feels that all the people around him have their eyes on him all of a sudden. Some of them are concerned with cutting and disdaining, but most of them are confused!</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan sighed and said slowly: &ldquo;Zhang Xiaofan, after you enter our Qingyun gate, what can we do wrong to you in Qingyun gate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan immediately shook his head and said: &ldquo;the real leader, no, there is no such thing. Shifu is very good to me&hellip; &quot; When he said that, Tian could not easily shake his body and his face was very complicated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Zhang Xiaofan, with a look of agony on his face. Two thoughts kept fighting in his mind. &ldquo;But I really have my own difficulties. I, I can&rsquo;t&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly there was a loud roar, which moved the whole audience like thunder, and scared everyone. Zhang Xiaofan had to take a step back to look at the man. He was shocked.</p>
<p>The person who makes this roar is not Qingyun, but Pukong, one of the four great monks in Tianyin temple. Pukong ranks the lowest among the four great monks in Tianyin temple, but he has the most intense temperament. When he was young, he subdued the demons and subdued the demons. He didn&rsquo;t know how many demons he killed by virtue of the Buddha&rsquo;s unique treasure, &ldquo;the golden bowl of the butcher&rdquo;. Later, as he grew older and understood the meaning of Buddhism, he began to live in seclusion in Tianyin temple.</p>
<p>Today, in the blood war of Qingyun, the general air opened up to kill the demons. They practiced the blood war with the mysterious Buddhism. At the moment, there was blood everywhere on and off the monk&rsquo;s robe. It looked like a Buddhist monk, just like a hell devil. No wonder Zhang Xiaofan and others were shocked.</p>
<p>This time, all the people of Tianyin temple came to Qingyun Mountain with the heart of raising teachers and questioning sins. How can the supreme Dharma &ldquo;great Brahma Prajna&rdquo; from the temple of heaven sound be learned by a small disciple of Qingyun sect? Now Pukong looks at Zhang Xiaofan. In my heart, I was annoyed, and I couldn&rsquo;t help but roar at the Buddha&rsquo;s Lion because today&rsquo;s killing has been started!</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was drunk by his thunderous voice. After a while, I haven&rsquo;t thought back. I stand with Lin Jingyu behind me. I have been giggling and watching Wang Ershu of shuiqilin, but he is shocked. I turn around and look at him.</p>
<p>A vicious monk. Full of blood stains, he stared at Zhang Xiaofan angrily, as if he was going to eat people!</p>
<p>On the Yuqing hall, there was a moment of silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah -&rdquo;</p>
<p>All of a sudden, a heartrending scream came from the broken Yuqing hall.</p>
<p>Uncle Wang Er&rsquo;s face was bloodless, and his whole face was pale. The whole man trembled. He pointed to Pukong and screamed: &ldquo;ghost! Ghost! Ghost! Ghost&hellip;&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>The voice is so shrill. Although it&rsquo;s sunny at the moment, everyone in the hall feels a chill at the same time.</p>
<p>Even Pukong, who was angry just now, was shocked by Uncle Wang. He was a little confused and hurried to explain: &ldquo;what do you say? Where am I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Uncle Wang seemed to have been killed by evil. The whole man was shaking with all his might. Lin Jingyu, who was next to him, tried his best to comfort him, but it didn&rsquo;t work at all. His whole body shrank slowly. Unexpectedly, I dare not look at Pukong again. My eyes are closed tightly. I am obviously scared. I just keep saying: &ldquo;ghost! Ghost! He killed people - don&rsquo;t kill me. Don&rsquo;t kill me, I, I, ah! Ah, ah, ah&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>Suddenly, a haze covered the place silently. Zhang Xiaofan and Lin Jingyu were stiff at the same time. Zhang Xiaofan, in particular, seems to have red light in his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know this man at all,&rdquo; said Pukong angrily</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu slowly released his grip on Uncle Wang and went to Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s side. He didn&rsquo;t need to look at him. Zhang Xiaofan is trying to control himself just like him, but the heavy gasp has already revealed their inner excitement!</p>
<p>&ldquo;He, why, why, what, say, yes, you?&rdquo; Lin Jingyu asked slowly, word by word. His face is just as terrible as Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s, but his eyes are full of hatred and still have a clear mind.</p>
<p>Pukong said angrily, &ldquo;how can I know? He&rsquo;s just a madman! &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan and Lin Jingyu change color at the same time, and most people in Qingyun gate frown. But just at this time, a sudden call of Buddha, the master of Pu Hong, who was sitting behind Pu Kong, suddenly opened his mouth with a sad tone and said in a low voice: &ldquo;Amitabha, if you plant evil, you will get evil results. Sin, sin! &quot;</p>
<p>As soon as this speech came out, the whole audience was silent. Pukong&rsquo;s body was more like wood. After a while, Pukong slowly turned to master Puhong and said in an astringent voice, &ldquo;what do you say, elder martial brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Puhong&rsquo;s face was pale, and he did not know whether it was the injury of his body or the guilt in his heart. He closed his eyes and lowered his eyebrows for a long time and said in a low voice, &ldquo;Fa Xiang.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since the second uncle Wang suddenly fell ill, he has always looked ugly and pale. His body shook and said, &ldquo;I am here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Puhong said slowly, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t hide it. Tell them! In those days, younger martial brother did something wrong. Today, you can never wronged this benefactor Zhang again. &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s mind roared, and there was a voice whistling, holding his heart.</p>
<p>FA Xiang slowly came forward, looked at countless stunned faces, then fell on Lin Jingyu and Zhang Xiaofan in the field, and finally stopped on Zhang Xiaofan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In those days, it was the people of Tianyin Temple who killed all the villagers in Caomiao village at the foot of Qingyun Mountain!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a moment, countless voices of astonishment, shock, disbelief and anger burst out in the Yuqing Hall of Qingyun Mountain. Even Taoist XuanZhen and Tian Jianyi, who are good at cultivating themselves, could not help changing their faces. Lin Jingyu pulled out the Dragon cutting sword, and the blue light was rippling.</p>
<p>Only Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s heart suddenly sank down so long, so deep, so deep, and then, the familiar cold feeling, deep blood and violence, enveloped him! (to be continued. )</p>
