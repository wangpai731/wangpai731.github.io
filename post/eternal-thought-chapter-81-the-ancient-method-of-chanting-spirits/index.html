      <p>Zhang Dazhou was nervous at the bottom of his heart. After hearing Bai Xiaochun saying that, he felt that there was some reason, so he nodded quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, the master also said, let me not see failure and success. Junior brother nine, please go back to the room and try to be spiritual.&rdquo; Zhang Dazhou coughs, so he said calmly.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun turned and walked quickly. After returning to the room, he saw the sword in his hand, frowned, worried about hitting Zhang Dazhou, and did not try it easily, but pinched the key and immediately appeared the tortoise pot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas, elder martial brother had been repressed all the time before. Now he has not recovered his confidence easily. He can not leave disappointed. If he does not know if this will make the spirit refining of flying sword succeed.&rdquo; In the silence of white Xiaochun, take out a color of fire, and throw the silver flying sword in the pot without any attempt.</p>
<p>Silver light is dazzling. After another flash, Xiaochun collects the tortoise pot, picks up the silver flying sword, bites his teeth, and his body spirit is roaring out. In a moment, it is not obstructed to integrate into the sword. The silver light shrinks strongly in a moment, and finally forms a silver pattern on the sword.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s done!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun was surprised. He didn&rsquo;t know whether Zhang dazhunben had succeeded, or the reason for his post-processing. He pushed the door open and went out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elder martial brother, you are. You are so good!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the yard, Zhang Dazhou was in need of gain and loss, nervous at the bottom of his heart, his face was stiff. After seeing Bai Xiaochun, his body trembled. When he saw the silver pattern on the flying sword in baixiaochun&rsquo;s hand, he snapped his thigh and laughed loudly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How, how!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said, I didn&rsquo;t control the strength before. I have succeeded in three weapons in purple Ding mountain. Even my master said I have high talent. Brother nine, this time, I succeeded!&rdquo; Zhang Dazhou was excited, took the flying sword handed over by Bai Xiaochun, and looked at it with a smile.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun was beside, and his eyes showed worship. Zhang Dazhou was more excited. He took a deep breath and waved his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, elder martial brother, I&rsquo;m happy today. I will give you another time to practice this sword and refine it twice!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elder martial brother, or next time&hellip;&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun felt that it seemed to be inappropriate. He remembered that zongmen had many taboos for refining spirit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No harm!&rdquo; Zhang Dazhou is absolutely obliged to say that he is energetic with a flying sword and starts to refine spirit with all his strength.</p>
<p>It was much more difficult than before. Almost all of Zhang&rsquo;s minerals were used. His whole body trembled, and he even swallowed a lot of pills. Only then did he draw the force of heaven and earth and blend into the body of the sword. Until the silver light of the sword was shining, Zhang daphou was sitting on the ground, panting like an ox.</p>
<p>But with excitement in his eyes, he gave the sword to Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun immediately nods. Before he takes the flying sword, Zhang daphou grabs his hand and tells him seriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since it&rsquo;s important for you to try in the room, it&rsquo;s better for you to go back to the room if you want to go back to the room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun blinked, feeling that Zhang daphou really understood the spirit refining, so she nodded solemnly and ran back to the room to think about it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe the elder martial brother&rsquo;s soul refining is really very powerful. Even if I didn&rsquo;t use turtle pattern pot just now, I was successful.&rdquo; He thought of this and took a look at the flying sword in his hand. He simply didn&rsquo;t need the turtle pattern pot. His spirit power suddenly dispersed and integrated into the body of the sword.</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, the silver light flashed, but it was very dark. In the sound of click, cracks appeared on the flying sword, which became waste products.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s face was bitter at once. When she was worried, she heard Zhang daphou&rsquo;s anxious voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ninth younger martial brother, I seem to have just seen silver light. What&rsquo;s the matter? Is it possible?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I haven&rsquo;t tried yet. I&rsquo;m going to try&hellip; &quot; Bai Xiaochun opened her mouth in a hurry and became anxious.</p>
<p>In the courtyard, Zhang daphou was silent, and his face was bitter. He was not stupid. How could he not hear it? Besides, just after Bai Xiaochun entered the wooden house, he vaguely saw a silver flash in the window position.</p>
<p>With a sigh, he knew that Bai Xiaochun didn&rsquo;t want to let himself down. Now he took a deep breath and opened his mouth to the wooden house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ninth younger martial brother, I know you tried. It&rsquo;s OK. I I&rsquo;ll go first. &quot; When Zhang daphou came, he was full of excitement. At the moment, he was hit by reality and was inevitably depressed.</p>
<p>He knew that he was reckless. According to his master, soul refining is a very mysterious skill. No one can have a complete success rate. However, there is a strange phenomenon in the whole cultivation world. It seems that The more successful people are, the more successful they will be, and the more failures they will be, the less successful they will be.</p>
<p>It seems that the more confident you are, the more likely you are to succeed.</p>
<p>Therefore, there are two kinds of cultivation methods in the spirit refining world. One is orthodox. The exquisite Alchemist is only responsible for the spirit refining, and will not personally test the spirit. Moreover, after the items are handed over to the employer, the employer will ask the employer not to test the spirit in front of the spirit refiner.</p>
<p>Whether success or failure, will not affect the mind of the alchemist, spotless, after the items are handed over to the employer, the alchemist will forget the matter by himself and always keep a calm state.</p>
<p>There is also an extreme method of practice, called the ancient method of reciting spirit. It stresses the mysterious and mysterious method of thinking. It means that you must see with your own eyes whether you succeed. The more successful you are, the more amazing it will be. It is just too extreme. Once you are frustrated too much, the influence will be so great that you can even destroy your talent and dare not touch it in your whole life.</p>
<p>However, there are many people who pursue this method. Even Xu Meixiang, Zhang&rsquo;s master, admits that if someone practices such extreme alchemy and can succeed continuously against the sky for a certain number of times, then the person&rsquo;s mental power will be extremely confident, and in the spirit refining, he will be astonished.</p>
<p>The treasure of Lingxi sect&rsquo;s Zhenzong, the Tianjiao sword which has been refined for ten times, was refined by such a crazy alchemist ten thousand years ago.</p>
<p>Zhang daphou was bitter and astringent. He understood that they practiced the orthodox method in the purple Ding mountain. He was too excited to make this mistake. He did not have a calm heart. He did not know how long it would take to recover.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun in the room, along the window to see Zhang Da Pang&rsquo;s lost figure. He gritted his teeth. He didn&rsquo;t want to disappoint him. He immediately found the same flying sword from the storage bag, took out the turtle shaped pot, and quickly practiced soul twice.</p>
<p>Zhang daphou smiles bitterly and pushes open the door of the yard. Just as he is about to leave, suddenly, a surprise voice comes from behind him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Big brother, it&rsquo;s done!&rdquo; The door of the wooden house was pushed open. Bai Xiaochun rushed out with a flying sword with two silver stripes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; Zhang daphou&rsquo;s body shakes and suddenly turns around. After seeing the flying sword, he immediately holds it in his hand. His body trembles slowly. He can&rsquo;t believe it. His eyes show excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha ha, I&rsquo;m Zhang daphou. I&rsquo;m really proud of myself. I&rsquo;ve succeeded twice. I&rsquo;ve succeeded twice!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Da Pang hugged Bai Xiaochun, and his tears almost came down in his ecstasy. He was not qualified for cultivation. If his ancestors had some connections with his master, he would not have entered Lingxi sect.</p>
<p>When he was in the fire kitchen, he could get to the third floor of condensate gas. After entering the outer door, without those natural materials and treasures, his practice became more and more difficult. Seeing that Heisan Pang surpassed himself and Bai Xiaochun surpassed himself, he felt lost in his heart.</p>
<p>Now that he knows that he has the talent of refining spirit, his joy is hard to imagine for outsiders. He thinks that he is useful. At the moment, he laughs in his excitement, and a strong confidence fills his whole body. It seems that there is a trace of strange force cohesion This strange force is the rudiment of the power of thinking.</p>
<p>The more successful, the more confident, the stronger the thinking power, the greater the success!</p>
<p>Maybe, even if it&rsquo;s not yourself, as long as you think it&rsquo;s done by yourself, step by step success, then you can also have mysterious and mysterious thinking power.</p>
<p>Zhang daphou left with excitement and excitement. Bai Xiaochun saw him off and stood in the yard. He didn&rsquo;t know whether what he had done was right or wrong. Seeing Zhang&rsquo;s happy appearance, he felt that he was right.</p>
<p>After Zhang daphou left for a few days, Bai Xiaochun finally knew the reason why Xiangyun mountain was short of people from Xu Baocai, because almost all the disciples of the outer gate who had reached the sixth floor of condensation gas began to close down and tried to break through to the eighth floor. He was eager to participate in the Tianjiao battle of the clan!</p>
<p>The Tianjiao battle of the outer gate on both sides of the north and the South will be held in three months. This battle will be noticed by the whole Lingxi sect. All the Xiuzhen families and xiaozongmen in donglinzhou are extremely concerned about it.</p>
<p>This battle is a struggle between the outer gate and the outer gate on both sides of the Taiwan Strait. The top ten chosen will be the dragon and Phoenix daughter of the Lingxi sect. To promote the inner disciples in this capacity will be quite different from those who promoted the inner disciples in other times.</p>
<p>Every 30 years in the first ten years of Tianjiao war, successive dynasties will continue to be brilliant, and become the leader of the sect, famous in all directions. Even other huge zongmen, which are the same as Lingxi sect, also care about it.</p>
<p>At the same time, every one who can be ranked in the top ten of the Tianjiao battle in the north and the South has amazing rewards, especially the first. It is said that the contribution is as high as hundreds of thousands, not to mention the natural materials and treasures, and even get a chance to enter the secret territory of the clan.</p>
<p>It makes countless people excited.</p>
<p>For the selection of the mysterious and unpredictable inheritance sequence in the legend, the top ten in the northern and southern Tianjiao war become the inner door, which is also an important driving force.</p>
<p>Before the Tianjiao battle, there was a qualification war, which was held separately on both sides of the Strait. The top ten disciples of the outer gate were selected to participate in the Tianjiao battle on behalf of each bank.</p>
<p>This time, the boundary of cultivation is set at the eighth layer of condensate gas, and only the eighth layer of condensate can participate. If you want to become an inner disciple, you have two requirements: one is condensate eighth layer, the other is through trial, and the other is promotion test in ordinary times. Only in Tianjiao war once every 30 years, according to the Convention, qualification war is listed as a test.</p>
<p>And this kind of trial, also called the strongest test by the disciples of the sect, is also the most remarkable test!</p>
<p>Therefore, the reason why many disciples of other schools have not been promoted all the time is that when they are waiting for the qualification war, they can be promoted to the inner gate if they rank in the top 50 of the qualification war, and then they can become representatives to participate in the battle of heavenly pride between the North and the south of Lingxi sect.</p>
<p>For example, Shangguan Tianyou, LV Tianlei, Zhou Xinqi, and others all thought that they would become the top ten in the south bank, fight against Tianjiao on the north bank, and finally become the inner disciples as the top ten of the northern and southern Tianjiao war. Their goal is to have the opportunity to step into the inheritance sequence of Lingxi sect in a few years&rsquo; time. This is their choice.</p>
