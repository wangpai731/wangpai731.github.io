      <p>Zhou Xinqi looks ugly. She didn&rsquo;t expect that the cave she chose was next to Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s cave. When she was outside, she knew that Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s hobby of calling his uncle was uncomfortable, so she avoided it every time.</p>
<p>But now, it was blocked at the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;White Uncle Zhou Xinqi took a deep breath. After she spoke lightly, she did not look at Bai Xiaochun. She flew off on the blue silk, and her long skirt danced to set off her beautiful face. She looked like a fairy. She used this way to drive away those admirers around her. Every time, it was very effective. This kind of detached attitude would make her give people a sense of distance and be unable to get close to her.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun is very happy, with her hands on her back and looks at Zhou Xinqi with admiration. She seems not to care about Zhou Xinqi&rsquo;s attitude. What she wants is just a word from Uncle Bai.</p>
<p>It was not until Zhou Xinqi left that Bai Xiaochun returned to the cave with satisfaction. He felt that he had completed a milestone today and finally got what he wanted. In the cave, he took out the Dragon elephant&rsquo;s sea Sutra and looked at it carefully. After a careful look, he thought of Tianjiao&rsquo;s fierce wartime ghost teeth, and his face slowly recognized it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ghost tooth doesn&rsquo;t know how to repair it. It&rsquo;s so powerful In particular, those fierce ghosts have the same control as beasts. If only I had a fierce beast. &quot; Looking back on the war, Bai Xiaochun was still in a state of apprehension. When he thought about it, he suddenly moved and took out a wooden box from his storage bag.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Breed animals If I have a chance to go to the north bank in the future, maybe It is not impossible for me to get a beast of my own, especially the beast, which I created When Bai Xiaochun thought of the magic of breeding animal species, she was very excited. After a long time, she put the wooden box away.</p>
<p>After pondering for a moment, he shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fed up with fighting and killing. I&rsquo;d better get to the condensate gas station quickly, so that we can build the foundation.&rdquo; When Bai Xiaochun thought of this place, he began to practice according to the content of the dragon image Huahai Sutra.</p>
<p>Although the dragon image turns into the sea, it can be perfectly grafted with purple Qi to control the tripod, but the way of practice is not the same. Instead, there are three pictures. The first picture is an ancient giant elephant, which is magnificent. It can open mountains and roar the heaven and earth. The ultimate power of the flesh makes Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s whole body vibrate at first sight, as if all the flesh and blood in his body, All of them tremble because of this picture, which is in line with some special law</p>
<p>In the picture of his whole body, it seems that his whole body is just like a flash of pure cloud, but when he wakes up, it seems that his whole body is full of blue clouds I&rsquo;ve had a cold sweat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kind of practice is this?&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun took a deep breath. Instead of looking at the third picture, he carefully studied the pithy formula and content of the dragon image Huahai Sutra.</p>
<p>After a long time, he raised his head and thought in his eyes. He gradually became thoughtful and enlightened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Contemplation and practice!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun murmured.</p>
<p>This method of practice is very mysterious. According to different stages, we can see different pictures to cultivate ourselves. We can imagine that there must be some mysterious force of heaven and earth on those three pictures, so that people can influence themselves when they see the pictures.</p>
<p>For the novice disciples, this method is not suitable for practice at all. Once they are forced to practice, they may even eat themselves back. Only when they reach the eighth layer of condensate gas and have a lot of spiritual power in their body, can they practice in this way.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun thinks that he doesn&rsquo;t want to go far. Instead, he only looks at the first picture. When he looks at the picture, his body trembles and his Qi and blood flow rapidly. It seems that he conforms to the characteristics of undead skin. His whole body is shining with silver light, which gives him a feeling that This dragon like sea, can cooperate with undead skin to make it more powerful.</p>
<p>As time went by, half a month passed quickly. In the past half a month, Bai Xiaochun opened the furnace to refine medicine. While practicing the Dragon elephant sea Sutra, Bai Xiaochun refined the miraculous medicine. As a result, his accomplishments gradually increased. At the same time, his undead skin was gradually silvery and developed a lot.</p>
<p>At the same time, after practicing the dragon image Huahai Sutra, he found that he had not practiced the skill of controlling the tripod with purple Qi. However, he had made great progress in the magic power of Ziqi Huading.</p>
<p>This phenomenon, let Bai Xiaochun is very surprised, he thought about it, and finally vaguely found the answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dragon image turns into the sea, which is an auxiliary skill with strong tolerance. It can increase the power of all magic arts. As for the shackles mentioned in the opening words&hellip;&rdquo; After a while, his right hand suddenly rose to the front.</p>
<p>Even Bai Xiaochun had a feeling that he could make the tripod dissipate and return to his body as if he had an idea.</p>
<p>When he thought about it, the tripod disappeared, and the aura came to his face. After he got into the body, he added the consumption of this magical power.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun immediately surprised, this kind of ease, can send can receive, is the purple gas Ding to Dacheng after the characteristics.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the help of the dragon like sea Sutra, I once thought about controlling people. Maybe there is hope!&rdquo; When Bai Xiaochun was happy, suddenly, he looked up and looked at the gate of the cave. He pinched his finger. Immediately, the gate became blurred and quickly transparent, so that he could see the outside world.</p>
<p>At the moment, it is dusk outside. There are hundreds of figures coming from the sky and the sky in the distance. The fastest dozens of people have even arrived outside Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s cave.</p>
<p>In the crowd, there was a young man who was handsome, but his face was pale and his eyes were bloodshot. He seemed to be crazy. It seemed that if someone touched him, he would immediately be hysterical.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun knows this young man, who is Beihanlie, disciple of the north bank!</p>
<p>The dozens of people around beihanlie, each of them, has surpassed the ordinary nine layers of condensate gas, and even more than a dozen of them have achieved great success in condensing gas. As for the hundreds of people behind, any one of them is really the ninth layer of condensate!</p>
<p>In particular, a big man beside beihanlie was very big. The whole man was like a hill. His appearance was somewhat similar to that of beihanlie. He stood there without saying a word. However, the momentum of his body surprised Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>That breath is not condensing gas can have, even faint, around the big man, as if there is an invisible whirlpool, making all the forces of heaven and earth condense to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hundreds of The inner disciples of the ninth and tenth floors of Ningqi! &quot; Bai Xiaochun opened his eyes and felt some scalp numbness. He quickly pinched the formula and immediately opened his cave array.</p>
<p>These hundreds of people are all inner disciples of the north bank. To be exact, they are all from sunset peak. Now they are coming to avenge their younger brother beihanlie.</p>
<p>Zhou Xinqi was the first to walk out of the cave. At the same time, many disciples of Xiangyun mountain also flew out quickly and surrounded the hundreds of people. At the moment of encirclement, someone immediately recognized the great man beside beihanlie and cried out in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The aura is swirling. This is This is a sign that the foundation is built in half a step beyond the condensation of gas! &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first day of sunset peak is proud, and the north wind is cold!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Four weeks people immediately exclaimed, Bai Xiaochun in the cave also because of the array existence, also heard the voice of the outer door, suddenly opened his eyes a little bigger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All of you, Tianjiao won the battle on the south bank. It&rsquo;s nothing to blame. Beihan congratulates you. Coming here today has nothing to do with the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. It&rsquo;s the private resentment of the northern Han family. Bai Xiaochun is so mean and shameless that he has made my younger brother regret all his life. As a brother, I can&rsquo;t bear it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This time I come here, I want an explanation for my younger brother!&rdquo; The north cold wind&rsquo;s words spread out. Before waiting for the inner disciples of Xiangyun mountain to answer, they suddenly looked at Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s cave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bai Xiaochun, get out of here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>One side of the north cold strong, red eyes, faint tears, he hysterically toward the white Xiaochun cave, issued a shrill roar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bai Xiaochun, get out of here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the two brothers of the North Han opened their mouth, the voice of Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s grievance came out of the cave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are unreasonable. I told you to admit defeat. I didn&rsquo;t blame me. When the big dog jumped on you, I still wanted to separate you&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut up, Bai Xiaochun, you come out, I&rsquo;m not at odds with you!&rdquo; Beihanlie roared. He felt that Bai Xiaochun was deliberately exposing his scar. At the moment, he rushed out like crazy to bombard Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s cave array, as if to vent all the resentment in this short time.</p>
<p>When Bai Xiaochun saw this, he found that the array was just fluctuating, and there was no sign that it was going to be broken. Then he put his heart down and decided not to go out. Looking at the crazy north cold, Bai Xiaochun sighed and continued to persuade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beihanlie, in fact, it&rsquo;s nothing. You think so. Your big dog has such a close relationship with you. Maybe it&rsquo;s a blessing in disguise. From now on, your way of controlling animals will be more powerful&hellip;&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun really wanted to persuade him to comfort him, but he didn&rsquo;t want to comfort him. As soon as he was comforted, beihanlie exploded and roared.</p>
<p>Even the north cold wind was gloomy. When he stepped outside Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s cave, he dropped his palm, and with a bang, the array trembled, and Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s heart shook violently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop it!&rdquo; At this moment, the inner disciples of Xiangyun mountain couldn&rsquo;t look down. They were not familiar with Bai Xiaochun, but now they were beaten by the sunset peak. If you just watch them with such open eyes, they might be the inner disciples of Xiangyun mountain in the future, and they would immediately lose their reputation in Lingxi sect.</p>
<p>At the moment, the inner disciples of Xiangyun mountain rushed out to stop them. When they wanted to stop them, all the hundreds of people brought by Beihan brothers scattered and blocked one after another. There was no fight between life and death. They just blocked the inner disciples of Xiangyun mountain, so that they could not interfere with the north cold wind in a short time.</p>
<p>This kind of thing is already a private fight between the two mountains. It belongs to a violation of the rules of the gate. But beihanfeng doesn&rsquo;t care. The Beihan family is also a glorious family. As long as you don&rsquo;t kill people, you can&rsquo;t commit a big crime.</p>
<p>The roaring sword, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s cave array, immediately distorted, the wave is more powerful, but this is unusual, Bai Xiaochun is still very nervous at first, can look at it, found that it is still OK, immediately relieved.</p>
<p>But he was kind-hearted, and he felt embarrassed, so he went to explain again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t blame this Why don&rsquo;t you stew that big dog and eat it. In this way, everyone will know that beihanlie is brave and brave, and he will eat whoever dares to attack him&hellip; &quot; Bai Xiaochun said, feeling as if he had strayed Just as he was about to go back, the north cold outside the door spurted out a big mouthful of blood directly. The whole person was dishevelled and sent out a shrill sound. He was actually dizzy and hit the array with one head.</p>
<p>In this scene, Bai Xiaochun was shocked.</p>
