      <p>In the field, everyone frowned and saw that the enchanting woman was surrounded. They took out this strange magic weapon. Most of them thought that they were going to be trapped animals. Now they are on guard. But the stone gave a loud drink, and the staff of the breaking Dharma flew in the air, and rushed forward.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan didn&rsquo;t have time to call out &ldquo;be careful&rdquo; at the back. He saw three foxes with long, thin and soft eyes looking at the huge body rushing towards the stone. He held a red spike beside the jade ring with his hands, slowly raised it and placed it in front of him.</p>
<p>The jade ring is turning gently, and it seems to reflect her face.</p>
<p>The moonlight is light and cold, shining on the top of the xuanhuojian. Somehow, the carved ancient Fire Totem seems to be revived, lifelike and burning.</p>
<p>The stone rises from the sky, and the staff of breaking the evil spirit method suddenly breaks through the sky, and comes to him, shouting loudly in his mouth: &ldquo;evil, suffer death!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment, the center of the xuanhuojian, the place of the Fire Totem, suddenly changed from the original dark red color to the bright, almost transparent red color, just like in a flash, the Fire Totem has been burned to the blazing by the nine gods fire.</p>
<p>And the totem of fire has turned into a burning fire.</p>
<p>Centered on the enchanting woman, a group of invisible and hot gas rushed out rapidly. Except for the feet where she stood, all the plants within three feet around were scorched in a flash. But I don&rsquo;t know why, but there was no ignition star and there was no fire.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan and Biyao looked at each other, never thought that there were such powerful magic weapons in the hands of these three evil foxes. The stone that people hurtle at the three evil foxes in the middle of the sky also sees this scene in the eyes. Although they are also surprised by the power of the magic weapon, they are not afraid at all. They grasp the big golden fangs in their hands with their right hands in the air, which is longer in the wind. They make a shriek in the air, circle a circle, and hit the three evil foxes with their heads.</p>
<p>The body is still in the air. The ground is already sand flying and stone walking. It seems that three evil foxes will be blown away by the strong wind. But she smiled coldly, her hands and fingers hooked on the red silk spike, and her body was slightly inclined. Aimed at the stone.</p>
<p>That burning Xuan fire Jian, reflected in her soft eyes, like two piles of angry flames.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boom&rdquo;!</p>
<p>In the loud sound, from the Fire Totem in the center of the xuanhuojian, a fire dragon suddenly erupted. With his teeth and claws open, his voice was startling. His whole body was ablaze with flames, which made most of the woods bright as day.</p>
<p>The stone was shocked. He saw that the fire dragon grew rapidly. When he came out from the xuanhuojian, it was still a flame. But when he got to the front of himself, the dragon head was as big as two people. Especially the blazing gas rushed towards him, which made people suspect that he was in the furnace.</p>
<p>See from Zhang Xiaofan below. I saw that under the impact of the huge fire dragon, the stone had not yet met, and the front end of the black hair on his temples had turned yellow. I can imagine what the scene he was facing.</p>
<p>But looking at the stone, he was not afraid. Although he was not scared, the staff of breaking evil method was urged by his magic power, and the golden light was more abundant, and he hit the head of the rushing faucet.</p>
<p>The fire dragon roared in the middle of the air, and two angry flames were emitted from the eyes of a pair of giant dragons. Suddenly, he opened his burning mouth and grabbed the huge mace.</p>
<p>The halo of gold and red is centered on the junction of them, which expands rapidly, accompanied by thunder and thunder. Stone only felt that his broken magic wand was so hot that he could hardly hold it. In a big surprise. Rise to the top of one&rsquo;s power, and take out the breaking spirit staff from the dragon&rsquo;s mouth.</p>
<p>I saw the fire dragon flying in the sky, roaring incessantly. With a big mouth, a thick fire pillar was spewed out and rushed straight to the stone.</p>
<p>The stone roared. Holding the Dharma formula with both hands, breaking the evil Dharma staff stood in front of him. The golden light was shining, and a wall of light was lifted up to block the fire pillar. However, his body was pushed back by the huge force involuntarily.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan saw the stone fall in the downwind and was in danger. He hurriedly put out his hand. The fire stick started silently and shot at the fire dragon from the side. Unexpectedly, the fire dragon seems to have spirituality, but he doesn&rsquo;t know it by looking at it. He turns around and stares at it. The mouth of the dragon is opened. The roar is a thick pillar of fire.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was caught off guard. Seeing that the fire was like a mountain, he rushed over like a sea of mountains. There was no way to avoid it. He had to bite his teeth and hold on to his magic power. The fire staff was shining blue. He went forward and caught the fire pillar.</p>
<p>At this time, he saw three evil foxes smile and soar into the air. The XuanHuo in his hand saw Yiyi&rsquo;s light and rushed to them.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan and stone are in a confrontation with that dragon. They are shocked. Even Biyao, who is standing behind the three evil foxes, is shocked. In an urgent moment, with a clear snap, Biyao flies up. Her right hand stretches like a jade finger, and sad flowers turn into countless petals, flying all over the sky, straight to the back of the three evil foxes.</p>
<p>But in the invisible place, Biyao&rsquo;s left hand was quietly placed on her waist, holding the little golden bell in her hand.</p>
<p>Three evil foxes seem to know the power of sad flower. They dare not take it hard. They dodge and hide in the past. Biyao doesn&rsquo;t catch up. They dodge to Zhang Xiaofan and stand beside him in the air.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan looks up at her, and Biyao&rsquo;s eye waves flow, but they also look at him.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan did not know why, and immediately turned his head.</p>
<p>The fire dragon is still in the middle of the sky, but the three goblin foxes, after Biyao rushes through, don&rsquo;t hesitate for half a minute, reach out for a move, xuanhuojian flies back to her hand, the whole person turns into a white light and disappears in the dark depth of the forest.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan and other three were stunned.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>In the distance, the fairy took a long breath on Monday and said: &ldquo;fortunately, fortunately, it seems that these three evil foxes are still not good enough in Taoism. They can&rsquo;t play the power of xuanhuojian, so they can only scare these young people. Otherwise, if we use the power of xuanhuojian, these people will be in danger. &quot;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan is not convinced and says: &ldquo;how do you know that she is not good enough? I don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;s falling behind when she&rsquo;s fighting one against three. &quot;</p>
<p>On Monday, the immortal glared at her and said, &ldquo;what do you know? Xuanhuojian is an ancient god with great power. It is said that when it is most powerful, it can bring out the eight wild fire dragons and burn all the things in the world. It&rsquo;s not enough to burn the ashes of these young people who don&rsquo;t know the height of the earth. &quot;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan snorted, ignored him and turned to look at the scene. &ldquo;Suddenly frown, said:&rdquo; Grandpa, you see they seem to chase the past</p>
<p>On Monday, Xian was surprised and hurried to see it. As expected, Zhang Xiaofan and others seemed to discuss a few words, then turned to the dark depths, that is to say, the place where the three evil foxes disappeared just now, in which the stone first, Zhang Xiaofan took two steps. But found that Bagao did not move, then turned around, in the face of Bagao, it seems to want to say something, but somehow, want to say again, a face rose some red.</p>
<p>But it was Baguio who smiled at once, as if he was angry in a low voice. When he went first, Zhang Xiaofan was stunned. Shook his head and followed up.</p>
<p>On Monday, the immortal stayed for a while and stamped his feet: &ldquo;these young people, they really don&rsquo;t know how to survive. Those three evil foxes have xuanhuojian in their hands. How dare they chase after them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan took a bite of ice sugar gourd and said quietly: &ldquo;you old man said that three evil foxes are not good enough to play the real power of xuanhuojian. In this case, she is not equal to no xuanhuojian. What are these young people afraid of? &quot;</p>
<p>On Monday, the fairy was silent, as if choking, unable to speak for a long time, and after a long time. All of a sudden, he thought of something and hurriedly said, &ldquo;come on, let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan was startled by him and said: &ldquo;go? Where to? &quot;</p>
<p>On Monday, the fairy strode forward and said, &ldquo;naturally, the demon has been removed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan sneered and followed up, saying: &ldquo;in the past, there have been so many big and small demons. How can I see you running without you rushing up to get rid of it? &quot;</p>
<p>Zhou Yixian&rsquo;s face is red. &ldquo;The most important thing for us to do is to have self-knowledge. Eh? &quot;</p>
<p>In the middle of his speech, he suddenly stopped and was attracted by another thing. Xiaohuan is behind him, looking along his eyes, but what Zhou Yixian looks at is the quiet thing that stops there from the beginning, which is nothing dynamic or static - Gujing.</p>
<p>At this moment, Zhang Xiaofan and others have disappeared in the dark. Just now, it seems that there are countless monsters that are completely disappeared. There are only two people left in the forest, one is the immortal and the other is Xiaohuan. The moonlight is cold and quiet, shining on the ancient well, reflecting the moss and the ancient traces, which is a bit of vicissitudes and desolation.</p>
<p>On Monday, Xian took a deep breath and walked over. Xiao Huan followed him, but she was also a little nervous. &ldquo;Grandpa, what do you want to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhou Yixian frowned and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to see what&rsquo;s strange in the well. Why do three evil foxes keep asking the boy what he saw?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan stopped three steps away from the ancient well. She felt a little hairy under her heart. She felt that there was silence and darkness around her, but in the darkness, there seemed to be a wind passing by. She didn&rsquo;t know how many eyes were peeping at her in the dark.</p>
<p>On Monday, Xian went to the ancient well and looked around. Seeing nothing different, he wanted to look down. Xiaohuan suddenly felt nervous behind him and cried, &ldquo;Grandpa, be careful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Monday, Xian glanced at her, smiled and said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s OK.&rdquo; Then he looked down into the well.</p>
<p>Xiaohuan stares at his face, and suddenly sees a surprised expression on Monday Xian&rsquo;s tense and solemn face. Then he becomes happy in a twinkling of an eye, but it turns into doubt, looks up and ponders.</p>
<p>Xiaohuan came up and whispered, &ldquo;Grandpa, what do you see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw as much gold as a mountain,&rdquo; she frowned on Monday</p>
<p>Xiaohuan: &ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Monday, the immortal said to himself, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s strange that the reflection in the well water is not a human shadow&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; Suddenly, there was a slight cry from Xiaohuan around her. On Monday, Xianxian was surprised and hurriedly looked at her. However, Xiaohuan did not know when to lie down beside the well and look down. Now she was looking up.</p>
<p>On Monday, Xian stayed for a while and said, &ldquo;what do you see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan shrugged her shoulders and said, &ldquo;there are so many ice sugar gourds like mountains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Monday, Xian fell to the ground.</p>
<p>Later, when the two of them walked towards the deep forest, on Monday, the immortal whispered to the small ring: &ldquo;I want to think about it. This ancient well is only afraid that it is the&rdquo; well of the full moon &ldquo;in the ancient legend, that is, at the full moon, if people look down, they will see their favorite people or things. However, I still don&rsquo;t understand why Sanwei evil fox has been asking the young man what he saw from the well? But now, I really want to know what the boy saw&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>This forest seems to be small from the outside, but Zhang Xiaofan and other people are in it. In the boundless night, there is a kind of boundless illusion. Each of the three men took up their magic weapon, walked through the darkness, and closely followed a white light in front of them. That&rsquo;s the trace of three foxes escaping.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the white light only swayed in front of the public for a few times, and then disappeared out of nowhere. Zhang Xiaofan and others drove the magic weapon. In a flash, they came to the place where the white light disappeared. They saw the ancient woods and the open space in the forest. But there is a hillock. On one side of the hillock, there is a hole. The rocks beside the hole are all black.</p>
<p>Needless to say, this is Blackstone cave.</p>
<p>The three men stopped at the entrance of the cave, looked at each other, and looked into the black stone cave. They thought that although the hole was not big, it was dark inside. It gives people a deep feeling. A gust of cold wind blows out, blowing over the body, as if there is a gooseflesh feeling.</p>
<p>Biyao frowned and said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s very dangerous in this cave, and the magic weapon in the hands of the fox just now is very powerful. Let&rsquo;s not venture in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan took a look at her, but before he spoke, the Stone said loudly: &ldquo;brother Zhang, we have done everything to get rid of demons. It&rsquo;s easy for us to give up today. In the future, the evil fox will come back, just for fear that the disaster will be even worse. &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan nodded at once and said, &ldquo;brother Shi is right. Let&rsquo;s go in now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biyao&rsquo;s face changed. Just about to get angry, Zhang Xiaofan turned around, looked sincere, lowered his voice, and said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s really dangerous inside. Brother Shi and I are under the right door. one &rsquo;s sense of honour makes it impossible to refuse. You, you, &ldquo;he paused, turned his head, but the voice still came,&rdquo; your own safety is important, don&rsquo;t light yourself. &quot;</p>
<p>Although Bagao can&rsquo;t see Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s face, she can hear his voice with some sincere care. Her heart is inexplicably sweet, but her mouth is cold: &ldquo;I want to enter, can you manage it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was stunned for a moment, and could not speak for a moment.</p>
<p>Stone looked at them and shook his head. He said, &ldquo;brother Zhang, let&rsquo;s go in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan answered and couldn&rsquo;t help but take another look at Biyao. She snorted and her body moved, but she got in front of the two of them and entered the dark stone cave. Zhang Xiaofan was frightened and hurriedly followed. He listened to the wind and thought that the stone was also behind him.</p>
<p>In the dark, the sad flower beside Bagao&rsquo;s hand slowly lit up, and the soft white light illuminated the place around five feet. When Zhang Xiaofan looked around, he saw that the surrounding rock walls were all dark and strange stones, and they were as hard as iron stones, which was extremely cold.</p>
<p>The black stone cave is similar to the wanbat ancient cave in kongsang mountain. Once entering the cave, the road goes down to the bottom of the ground, but the slope is more than the wanbat ancient cave. I don&rsquo;t know whether the villagers dug it or whether it is natural.</p>
<p>After a while, the three men went deep into the ground, but there was no sound around them. There was no living thing. They were not in the ancient cave of ten thousand bats, and there were countless terrible blood sucking evil bats. As Zhang Xiaofan walked along, his mood could not help but float back to the scene of wanbat ancient cave at the beginning of that day, and naturally thought of the time when he and Biyao were trapped in the blood dripping cave under the lifeless abyss.</p>
<p>At this time, the front of the green Yao suddenly stopped, the mouth issued a light call.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan thought that there was any danger. He was in a hurry and rushed up. Standing beside her, Biyao was stunned and looked at him.</p>
<p>There is no way out.</p>
<p>A precipice, across the front, under the cliff is dark, but from a distance, in the dark depth, it seems that there are still a few things flickering like ghost fire. Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s body shakes. In a trance, he thinks he is back in front of the lifeless abyss.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s obvious that this place is much worse than the abyss of the dead. It&rsquo;s not only a hundred times smaller in space. Zhang Xiaofan frowned and looked back at the stone. Stone now also came to the edge of the cliff, looked at it, pondered for a while, and said: &ldquo;brother Zhang, it seems that we have to go down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan nodded and said, &ldquo;brother Shi, be careful yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You too,&rdquo; said the stone, with a dignified face After that, Dharma Jue pointed out that the golden Dharma staff of broken evil spirits was sacrificed and raised to the front. He jumped up, inhaled deeply, and then slowly lowered.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan turned his head and took a look at Biyao, but this time he didn&rsquo;t say anything. Then he started to use the fire stick and went on with it.</p>
<p>After him, Baguio suddenly smiled with joy.</p>
<p>Gold, green, white three color light group, slowly falling from the cliff, the surrounding is still the kind of black rock. There&rsquo;s nothing else. There&rsquo;s still no sound around. There&rsquo;s just a strange place. It&rsquo;s going down. It feels like the temperature around is rising.</p>
<p>So he went down for a long time. Zhang Xiaofan gradually saw the surrounding environment with the light of three magic weapons. He saw that there was no way ahead of the cliff, but a whole face of grotesque cliff. The place where the three of them are located looks like an ancient well magnified hundreds of times, falling straight down.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the stone at the bottom said, &ldquo;be careful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan and Biyao were surprised and hurried to guard. They saw a small stone cave on the stone wall not far below. There were two groups of small bright and deep eyes in the cave, looking at them.</p>
<p>Stone made a sign to them, then slowly leaned over, Zhang Xiaofan and Biyao were holding their breath, carefully looking there.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how long there hasn&rsquo;t been a light shining on this dark place. When the golden light of the stone breaking magic wand lights up this small hole, they see the things inside together: it&rsquo;s a slapped rat, making a nest with this small hole. Now they are staring at these three unexpected guests.</p>
<p>Stone shook his head, retreated, and looked at Zhang Xiaofan and Biyao behind him. They smiled bitterly, and then descended again.</p>
<p>However, in the following scenario, they never thought of it.</p>
<p>One, two, three In the dark or bright or dark light, dark, in front of them around, up and down, slowly lit up. In the dark, it seems that there are also countless low gasps, and there seems to be a low roar in the dark.</p>
<p>Although the upper part of the black stone cave seems to be a barren land, without any vitality, but under the cliff, deep into the dark place, there are countless creatures growing here unexpectedly.</p>
<p>The darkness seemed to lift the ancient veil in front of their eyes. With the inexplicable heartbeat, from the mouse hole to the next, there were more and more big and small holes on the stone wall, and then there was a hole almost a few feet apart. And in that cave, there are all kinds of strange creatures: Rats and bats, apes and leopards that are as tall as a man, and they don&rsquo;t know how they usually prey on them?</p>
