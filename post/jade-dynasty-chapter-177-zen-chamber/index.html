      <p>Thunder, lightning, strong wind, rainstorm, seem to have been howling in my ears all the time. The confusion and confusion in my mind seem to have confused me? Just in the intense pain, I feel a gust of wind and rain passing by, towards an unknown place.</p>
<p>It seems that someone is talking. The voice is quite strange. It sounds a bit anxious and faintly hears: &ldquo;there seems to be something wrong with him. Would you like to have a look?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A cold hand swam over him to check. After a moment, he was shocked and said, &ldquo;how did he hurt so much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man next to him said angrily, &ldquo;nonsense, he is under the sword of killing immortals. Do you think&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t hear what he said, because a dizziness hit his head and almost fainted. In the middle of his confusion, he only vaguely felt that the sky was still roaring and thundering.</p>
<p>The people around him seemed to be surprised and checked. The cold breath on his hand made him wake up for a moment. He heard the man say in a hurry: &ldquo;no, his forehead is hot. I&rsquo;m afraid he has a high fever&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Did you have a fever?</p>
<p>This was the last thought of GUI Li. After that, he fainted again and lost consciousness.</p>
<p>A roar awakened him from his unconsciousness. His first reaction was that he thought it was thunder from the sky. But somehow, although some people wake up, his eyes are still dark. He tries his best to open his eyes and look around, but he is surprised to find that his eyelids are still closed and can not open them.</p>
<p>Then, a sharp pain came, not from his seriously injured chest, but from his throat. Subconsciously, he moved his mouth and gave a hoarse and slight cry: &ldquo;water&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>There seemed to be no one around him, only he was lying on the ground helplessly. The thirst in his throat became more and more intense, just like a fire. His lips moved slightly, and his body moved slightly with the strength from nowhere. And the consciousness in the mind seems to be more sober.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; Suddenly, a voice came from the side, which was different from usual. However, it seems that I have heard of it, and I am familiar with it. With a bit of surprise in his voice, he said, &ldquo;you wake up, elder martial brother. Come on, he&rsquo;s awake&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>There was a sudden silence around. After a moment, a footstep quickly approached and walked to the ghost.</p>
<p>GUI Li struggled to open his eyes again, but somehow, this time, all his strength disappeared. He saw two figures squatting beside him, and behind them, there seemed to be some dark shadows. As for the faces of these people. He couldn&rsquo;t see one of them clearly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Water&hellip;&rdquo; He whispered again.</p>
<p>This time, people around me understood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, get the water, come on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a hurry, he ran back and forth, and in a moment someone came. Then a cold hand lifted his head carefully, and a bowl edge like thing leaned against his lips.</p>
<p>The cool water touched his cracked lips, and the muscles on his face moved. He opened his mouth and drank the water in. The clear water into the throat, like a spring into the dry land, immediately relieved the burning pain.</p>
<p>My heart was relieved. At once a burst of weariness came up, and fell asleep again.</p>
<p>The people nearby were startled, and immediately someone came over and pressed the ghost&rsquo;s pulse. After a moment, he was relieved and said: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not in the way. He&rsquo;s hurt too much. At the same time, he has a fever and his physical strength is exhausted. At present, he is not worried about his life. &quot;</p>
<p>As soon as he said this, the figures around him seemed to be relieved. Then, it seemed that someone looked at the ghost and sighed softly.</p>
<p>This time, I don&rsquo;t know how long it took. During this period, the ghost woke up several times, but after a moment of waking up, he immediately fell asleep. In his impression, he only remembered that there was always someone waiting for him.</p>
<p>Suddenly, he saw many people, including his parents when he was young, the innocent and beautiful elder martial sister, the unforgettable Biyao, the irresistible Lu Xueqi, and many others. Once, he even felt that he had seen the Dharma minister and Dharma Master brother of Tianyin Temple ten years ago, sitting beside him and chanting Buddhist Scriptures for him.</p>
<p>He had a bitter smile at that time, but even he didn&rsquo;t know whether his bitter smile could be displayed on his face, maybe, it was just a dream after all.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, this upside down life is like a dream!</p>
<p>Why praise the Scriptures for me?</p>
<p>What is the use of chanting scriptures?</p>
<p>When he was awake for a moment, he thought about it quietly in his mind, and then he fainted again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dong Dong Dong Dong&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>It seemed that the deep bell ringing in the sky, long and long, awakened him from the deep nightmare. The deep bell, from far to near, slowly, seemed to knock into his heart.</p>
<p>For the first time, he didn&rsquo;t have the impulse to open his eyes. He just lay quietly, not thinking about where he was and what world he was outside?</p>
<p>The world, but now only the low sound of the bell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dong Dong Dong Dong&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>The sound of the bell was so melodious that it seemed that it would never stop. He listened attentively, breathing gently, and his whole spirit was integrated into the gentle tone, and he would never leave again.</p>
<p>It was the first time that he was so unconcerned.</p>
<p>Who knows how much burden the day, what kind of pain?</p>
<p>However, this small world, after all, can not last, a burst of pace from far and near, to his place, disrupted his thinking.</p>
<p>It was the bell beating in the heart, suddenly seemed to leave him, suddenly far away in the horizon.</p>
<p>Silence, sigh</p>
<p>Slowly, he opened his eyes.</p>
<p>Buddha!</p>
<p>This was what he saw at first sight.</p>
<p>A big &ldquo;Buddha&rdquo; character is hung high on the roof. Around the word, there is a circle of golden patterns around it. Then along the periphery, five hundred arhat statues are carved carefully, forming a big circle. All the Arhats are of the same size, but they are all different in appearance and body shape. They are arranged in rows and extremely upright. Then, on the outside of the circle is the ceiling with blue background and black edge, which is two feet higher than the middle circle of Buddha. The painting style on it is different. It is a square square square. Each square is square. The golden edge is painted with kylin, Phoenix, golden dragon, goat and other Buddhist auspicious animals. In each of these squares, it&rsquo;s the same.</p>
<p>Although he is not good at carving architecture, he can see that this is a masterstroke after only a glance. On the roof. In the inner circle around the Buddha&rsquo;s character, two golden chains hang down, and a long-term lamp hangs upside down. Viewed from the bottom up, it is roughly a three foot copper basin. It&rsquo;s filled with lamp oil, I think.</p>
<p>GUI Li frowned and turned to look around. He saw that it was like a Zen room in a temple. The room was quite spacious. The four corners were large pillars of red paint, and the floor was paved with green bricks. The door was made of Tung wood. A window was opened on both sides, and the same red paint was used to look solemn.</p>
<p>On one side of the wall, there is a picture of Guanyin holding water jade dew bottle in his hand. At the bottom of the table was an incense table, on which there were four plates of fruit, namely, pears, apples, oranges and oranges. Before the fruit offering, there was a copper stove with three sticks of sandalwood on it, and wisps of light smoke were floating in the air.</p>
<p>And on the other side of the wall, is where the ghost. There is a wooden bed here. It is simple and solid, and there is no more decoration. I think the monk doesn&rsquo;t care about it. In addition to the above, there is only a round table in the middle and four round benches around. The table is black. There are teapots and cups on the table, which are simple porcelain.</p>
<p>At this time, the sound of footsteps had reached the door. The door of the meditation room &ldquo;squeaked&rdquo; and was pushed open from outside. A man stepped in. Look at him. He was stunned for a moment, but he was a strange young monk who had never seen him. He held a wooden plate in his hand and a new kettle on it. He walked in without looking at the ghost. Instead, he went directly to the table in the room and changed the teapot on the table with the one on the wooden plate in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You Who is it? &quot; Ghost Li asked, but just said a word, suddenly feel sore throat, although not the last time he was in a coma as intense fire, but also very bad, voice also suddenly dumb down.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the little monk was frightened and turned around immediately. It seemed that the wooden plate on his handle was almost knocked over in a hurry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! Are you awake? &quot; The little monk seemed quite surprised, but he had a happy look in his eyes and said with a smile, &ldquo;wait a minute. I&rsquo;ll call my elder martial brothers to come and see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that, he was about to run to the door. He ran at his back and asked in a hoarse voice, &ldquo;excuse me, little master. Where is this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little monk looked back and said with a smile: &ldquo;here? Of course, this is Tianyin temple. &quot;</p>
<p>Tianyin temple!</p>
<p>The ghost suddenly froze, such as being hit by thunder. The little monk ran away all the way. He thought he was going to call for someone, but he was left lying back on the bed, confused.</p>
<p>Tianyin temple</p>
<p>His heart was full of doubts, but somehow, there was something bitter in his heart.</p>
<p>Tianyin temple Tianyin temple Universal wisdom</p>
<p>There was a faint voice of speaking in the distance. At the same time, a few feet came to the meditation room. Someone asked the little monk something in a low voice. The little monk was obviously young, naive and lively, and his laughter kept answering.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why, listening to those questions and answers, he was suddenly out of his mind. He didn&rsquo;t want to think about his own situation or his past hatred. At this moment, he suddenly envied this ordinary little monk for no reason. Like him so naive and lively appearance, perhaps do not know that the world also has pain and hatred?</p>
<p>Young and ignorant, but instead of our many years, the happiest day?</p>
<p>At the door, someone said to him, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t have to go in. Why don&rsquo;t you go to the backyard and inform the abbot that benefactor Zhang Xiaofan has already woken up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little monk said with a smile, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s OK. However, elder martial brother FA Xiang, you have agreed to teach me to practice Prajna. I can&rsquo;t go back on it. &quot;</p>
<p>The man outside the door said with a smile: &ldquo;little fellow, you are so greedy. Go quickly. I promise you that I will not regret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little monk was obviously very happy. He laughed and hopped away. The wooden door opened, squeaking, as if someone stopped outside the door, took a deep breath, and then walked in.</p>
<p>As expected, it was the Dharma minister, and the tall and big monk Dharma Shan followed him.</p>
<p>A white monk&rsquo;s clothes, white face, holding a rosary in his hands, the appearance of Dharma looks like it has not changed in the past ten years. He walked slowly to the wooden bed where the ghost was lying. When he came to the bed, his eyes and the ghost&rsquo;s eyes looked at each other. There was no word.</p>
<p>The atmosphere of the room was a little strange for a moment. After a while, FA Xiang showed a smile. &ldquo;Benefactor Zhang, are you awake?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have my surname Zhang. I&rsquo;ve forgotten that name for a long time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>FA Xiang&rsquo;s face remains unchanged, and he only looks at the ghost. After a while, he murmured, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s up to you to choose a name. But if you don&rsquo;t want your surname, do you want to be worthy of the parents who gave birth to you and raised you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His face changed and he snorted, but he didn&rsquo;t say anything more. He turned his head and stopped looking at him.</p>
<p>FA Xiang didn&rsquo;t mean to blame him. He and FA Shan looked at the demon who was despised by the right way in the world. The eyes were full of kindness.</p>
<p>FA Shan moved two chairs by the round table behind him and put them on the bedside. In a low voice, &ldquo;please sit down, elder martial brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, how do you feel when you sit on the chair</p>
<p>GUI Li didn&rsquo;t need to ask. In fact, he had already secretly checked his body. The ribs that had been severely damaged to the fracture of his chest had been completely connected. Now he was bound with thick bandage, obviously to help fix it. As for the wounds on the shoulders, they were all wrapped up in good condition. Although pain came from time to time in the wounds, there was a faint sense of coolness. Obviously, the wound has been covered with excellent wound medicine to achieve such curative effect.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t answer and was not angry. He said with a smile: &ldquo;when you were in a coma, I have already helped you to connect the broken bone. Other skin injuries are not serious. It&rsquo;s just that your internal organs have been severely damaged. You have to take care of them carefully to keep them in good condition, and you will also be strong. Otherwise, even if you are a person of profound cultivation, you will be seriously injured. &quot;</p>
<p>He pauses for a moment, and then says, &ldquo;my younger brother also told you just now! This is Tianyin temple. No one in the world knows about you except a few people in our temple, so you are very safe. You just have to stay here and have a good life and recuperate</p>
<p>GUI Li suddenly interrupted him, looked into his eyes and said, &ldquo;did you save me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The smile on FA Xiang&rsquo;s face froze for a moment. He seemed to be hesitant. He looked back and looked at FA Shan. FA Shan lowered his head and gently recited the Buddhist name.</p>
<p>FA Xiang turned to his face, no longer hesitated. He nodded and said, &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He snorted, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t tell me you don&rsquo;t know. If you are known by Qingyun gate like this, what will be the situation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>FA Xiang said, &ldquo;naturally I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li sneered: &ldquo;in this case, why do you want to save me, the demon cult, on your back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>FA Xiang looks at him. Somehow, his eyes are different.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you looking at?&rdquo; grimly frowned</p>
<p>FA Xiang laughed and said, &ldquo;how do you know that I must have come to save you on my back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; he said</p>
<p>The Dharma minister said leisurely, &ldquo;the seven vessels of Qingyun gate were all unusual people, and each had something extraordinary. Zeng Shuchang, the head of fenghuifeng peak, was one of them. When we fought with him that day, we had to entangle him, and we should not expose our skills in a short period of time. I asked myself that I could not do that. &quot;</p>
<p>He stares at FA Xiang for a long time. FA Xiang is calm and right and smiles.</p>
<p>For a long time, GUI Li suddenly closed his eyes and stopped looking at each other.</p>
<p>FA Xiang nodded and said, &ldquo;you still need more rest if you are still seriously injured.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With his eyes closed, he suddenly said, &ldquo;why do you want to save me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Dharma minister was silent for a moment and then said, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t answer this question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Dharma minister said in a low voice, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t have to worry. After a few days, when you are well, you will be told.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He opened his eyes and frowned: &ldquo;who?&rdquo;</p>
<p>FA Xiang moved his mouth and hesitated for a moment, but finally he said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s OK to tell you, it&rsquo;s my mentor, master Pu Hong, the abbot of Tianyin temple!&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li was stunned for a moment. After a moment, he looked at his face and knew that he could not ask any more questions. He simply took a breath and lay down.</p>
<p>In the distance, the sound of the bell was melodious, and once again, it passed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dong Dong Dong Dong&hellip; &quot; (to be continued. )</p>
