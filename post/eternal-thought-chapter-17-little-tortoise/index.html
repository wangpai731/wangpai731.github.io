      <p>Go to &ldquo;small talk → net&rdquo; to provide you with wonderful novels to read. A kind of Go to &ldquo;small talk → net&rdquo; to provide you with wonderful novels to read.</p>
<p>The next morning, Bai Xiaochun walked out of the wooden house early. At a glance, he saw that the Lingdong bamboo in the holy field had grown to more than half a person&rsquo;s height. He nodded with satisfaction. Then he walked out of the yard and walked along the mountain road towards the Wanyao Pavilion.</p>
<p>In the distance, the sun rises, and the sky shines in the sky. If there are golden carp swimming in the sky, it looks very spectacular. Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s posture is light and brisk, and there is no pause along the way. Gradually, he sees many disciples from other schools, but no one knows him. He can&rsquo;t help but miss some senior brothers in huozaofang.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how the elder martial brother is now, and black three fat&hellip;&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun felt a little sad and walked for more than half an hour. When the sun rose completely, he saw ten amazing stone tablets in Wanyao pavilion from a distance.</p>
<p>These ten steles are the symbol of Wanyao Pavilion. Each stone tablet has a light blue light, which is tens of feet high. It looks like a rainbow, like ten giants standing there. They are very powerful.</p>
<p>The stone tablet can clearly see a line of handwriting, representing the ranking, from one to a hundred.</p>
<p>It is just that there is no name on it, but a pattern, each of which represents the future pharmacist&rsquo;s imprint of the proud man who once left his declaration in Wanyao Pavilion.</p>
<p>Every pharmacist has a mark of his own, which will be engraved on the satisfactory elixir refined and spread through the ages. Therefore, for pharmacists, the mark represents glory and is very important.</p>
<p>When Hou Yunfei came here with Bai Xiaochun, he also gave a brief introduction. At the moment, Bai Xiaochun came alone. As he approached, he saw the ranking of the ten stone tablets.</p>
<p>The most conspicuous is the first on the stone tablet in front of him.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a vase!</p>
<p>This vase, Hou Yunfei once told Bai Xiaochun, represents Zhou Xinqi!</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun is no stranger to this name. When he was a worker, he once heard Zhang Da Pang eating ginseng whiskers in the moonlight and sighing about Zhou Xinqi.</p>
<p>This daughter was originally an ordinary family. Several years ago, an elder of zongmen noticed that her talent was amazing. So she introduced her to zongmen. After carefully investigating her qualifications, she immediately caused a sensation in the whole Lingxi clan.</p>
<p>She was a rare plant spirit pulse. She not only practiced several times faster than ordinary people, but also had amazing potential in refining medicine. She eventually joined Xiangyun mountain and became the only disciple of Li Qinghou. She was regarded as the future pharmacist to support the sect after Li Qinghou!</p>
<p>No one, no matter how highly qualified, will become a disciple of Lingxi sect directly. Therefore, like Tianjiao of the other two mountains on the south bank, this daughter starts from the outer disciples to hone herself. Nevertheless, the supply of cultivation resources is naturally distributed according to the inner gate.</p>
<p>And anyone knows that Zhou Xinqi won&rsquo;t take long to become an inner disciple.</p>
<p>This makes countless students adore the beautiful.</p>
<p>Because of these reasons, she declared that she was outstanding among the disciples of Xiangyun mountain. Even those inner disciples never regarded her as an outside door, and even the old-fashioned ones were very afraid of her.</p>
<p>When Bai Xiaochun thought of this place, he was very curious about Zhou Xinqi. Looking at the stone tablets, he simply went around a large circle and looked at them one by one. Gradually, he was a bit surprised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zhou Xinqi is also very powerful. She has eight of the ten stone tablets, all of which are the first. The remaining two, without her name, should be that she has not compared them!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun opened her eyes and swept the stone tablet.</p>
<p>At the moment, there were more and more disciples around the Wanyao Pavilion. Soon, Bai Xiaochun withdrew her eyes and was looking for a place to exchange for the second chapter of vegetation. Seeing that there were more and more people here, she was a little surprised. I didn&rsquo;t know why there were so many people today, so she pushed forward and suddenly heard the sound of uproar around her like the sound of waves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sister Zhou is here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha ha, the news that came out before is true. Elder martial sister Zhou will come here these days. It&rsquo;s worth waiting for me for many days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This time, there are five chapters on vegetation and three chapters on spirit and beast. Elder martial sister Zhou is the first. This time, she will definitely challenge the fourth chapter of spirit beast!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the voices of discussion around him suddenly raised, the crowd was crowded for a moment. Bai Xiaochun was sandwiched inside. Fortunately, he was not fat now. He pushed around and finally squeezed out. When he looked up, he saw a rainbow flying from the distance.</p>
<p>The rainbow is a blue silk, on which there is a woman in a dress. The woman has silken black hair, slender Phoenix eyebrows, a pair of eyes like stars and cold moon. Her skin color is wonderful, her figure is light and elegant.</p>
<p>At the moment, one of the ten stone tablets flew away. In the cheers of the disciples from other schools around, the woman fell down and did not look around. In her eyes, there were only ten wooden houses next to each other under the stone tablet. She chose one and walked in.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun saw that under the ten stone tablets, there was a row of wooden houses around each stone tablet. At the moment, many people came in and out of the wooden houses under the stone tablets except the one to which the woman went.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Finally, I saw elder martial sister Zhou again. This time, senior sister Zhou will be the first in the nine steles of success!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elder martial sister Zhou&rsquo;s goal is to be the first of the ten steles that have never been seen before, and only she can do this. As she goes to examine the fourth and fifth chapters of the spirit beast, she must be the first!&rdquo; When the disciples around him were excited, Bai Xiaochun went to one of his disciples who looked thin and weak. At first, he yelled at elder martial sister Zhou to cheer him on. Then he took the opportunity to ask. The other party seemed to be in a good mood and gave a detailed answer.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun decided that if he wanted to get the second chapter of vegetation, he needed to go to the wooden house under the stone tablet for assessment. Only when he succeeded could he get it. So he rushed to the first stone tablet and finally got close to it. He found that the wooden house here was full. After a while, he saw someone coming out of the house dejectedly. He did not hesitate and immediately stepped over.</p>
<p>As soon as I entered the wooden house, the noise outside became very quiet as if it was separated. The wooden house was not big. There was a futon in the middle, and there was a small stone tablet in front of it.</p>
<p>According to the method asked, Bai Xiaochun sits on the futon with his knees crossed. He takes out the jade slips from the first chapter of plants and plants and touches the stone tablet. The jade slips blend in instantly, and the stone tablet is slightly shocked, and the light diffuses out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The elder martial brother just now said that he would like to draw a mark on the stone tablet to represent his future pharmacist.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun thought for a moment, he laughed and drew a turtle on it. He liked tortoise. The tortoise was crooked and ugly, but he thought it was very good.</p>
<p>The mark of the tortoise disappeared. Bai Xiaochun took a deep breath, calmed down and concentrated. His eyes showed the essence. His right hand raised his hand and slowly pressed it towards the stone tablet. Almost at the moment when he touched the stone tablet, his mind exploded. When he saw it clearly, it was not a wooden house, but an imaginary space.</p>
<p>Before Bai Xiaochun looked around, his eyes suddenly flashed. In front of him, countless herbs appeared in an instant.</p>
<p>These herbs are not complete, but all broken, cut into more than 10 pieces, all confused together, dense spread out.</p>
<p>If you look at it, the number is not clear.</p>
<p>This is exactly what the numerous disciples of Xiangyun mountain have pointed out. Over the years, countless people have been in awe of the examination of Wanyao Pavilion. As a result, all the people who appear on the stone tablet and enter the top 100 are envied by countless people, and they are even more convinced.</p>
<p>Especially for the top ten and even the first, it deserves its name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Within a stick of incense, put together the spirit plant, and start with the complete quantity as the assessment.&rdquo; A cold voice, as if no emotion exists, reverberates in this illusory space.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So simple?&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun felt a little inconceivable. With his deep understanding of the herbs in the jade slips, he could see the fragments that could make up hundreds of herbs.</p>
<p>He thought a lot before he came here. Now he felt relieved at the assessment, but then he felt uneasy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, the number of people who want to pass such a simple assessment must be very high.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun was nervous. He quickly grasped the time, raised his right hand and pointed to more than ten times in a row. Every piece of herb that he pointed to, according to his thoughts, gathered together in an instant. In the blink of an eye, he formed two herbs.</p>
<p>His hands didn&rsquo;t stop, and he continued to point again, almost without pause. Countless fragments flew out and condensed with each other, forming a plant of herbs. Gradually, there were more and more, and soon there were hundreds of them.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s eyes were fixed and his mind was highly concentrated. He forgot all the things around him. There were only these pieces of herbal medicine in front of him. His hands were flying fast. He was worried that he would fail the examination. So he was very cruel at the moment. His eyes were bloodshot and his hands were faster.</p>
<p>One hundred, two hundred, three hundred, five hundred A thousand!</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun was sweating, and his head even emitted white smoke. His hands were faster. As long as he looked at the pieces of grass and trees, he could immediately recognize which kind of herbal medicine it was. When he recited the jade slips, he even wanted to grind them into ashes to study.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that there is no such condition, so we can only observe the extreme, see the micro knowledge of the whole.</p>
<p>If this scene was seen by the disciples outside, everyone would take a breath of disbelief. They thought that the examination was disgusting, but they never expected that Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s research on ten thousand herbs in the jade slips was really outrageous.</p>
<p>Time goes by, two thousand, three thousand</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s eyes are full of blood. His hands can only barely follow his thoughts. If it was not for the cultivation support of four layers of condensation gas, he would have been unable to keep up with him.</p>
<p>To this extent, Bai Xiaochun does not know whether he can finally pass, can only bite his teeth and keep going.</p>
<p>Four thousand, five thousand, six thousand, seven thousand</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how long it passed. When the fragments of the herbs were not much left, all of them suddenly flashed and disappeared in an instant. There was another flower in front of him. When it was clear, he had already returned to the wooden house. On the stone tablet, there was a jade slip, which was the first one he had integrated into the plants.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a little bit worse, just a little bit worse&hellip;&rdquo; He felt uneasy. When he picked up the jade slips and walked out of the cabin dejectedly, he heard the cheers of countless people outside.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun looked up in surprise and saw the wooden house where Zhou Xinqi was. The girl also happened to come out. The stone tablet behind her, the vase representing her name, had appeared in the first place.</p>
