<p>Seeing Xu Baocai come to the door, Bai Xiaochun suddenly stands up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so fast&hellip;&rdquo; His eyes showed hesitation. Although he had made full preparations in the past half a year, he still felt that he was not ready. According to his idea, he had to wait until the fourth layer of condensate gas could be insured.</p>
<p>But now that the other party with seven or eight people came together, Bai Xiaochun knew that he couldn&rsquo;t hide, so he bit his teeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spell it He took a deep breath, put on seven or eight fur coats, and carried the spare pot for cooking LingMi on his back. Then he opened the door nervously and went out.</p>
<p>Almost at the same time when he walked out, Zhang daphou and others also carried kitchen knives and spoons in front of the door of the fire kitchen room, holding against Xu Baocai and others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said how I heard crows crowing this morning. It turns out that you supervisors only know how to squeeze the sons of the same family and come to our fire kitchen to spread wild!&rdquo; Zhang daphou snorted coldly. Standing there like a hill, his voice was like thunder, which spread all around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zhang daphou, others are afraid of you, but our supervisor room doesn&rsquo;t care about you. We received a cry from younger martial brother Xu. Today we come to exercise the rights of the supervisor&rsquo;s room. Do you dare to resist?&rdquo; The seven or eight figures around Xu Baocai look proud. Although their clothes are also made up of servants, there is an obvious word on the cuff, which represents the rights of their supervisor&rsquo;s office and their extraordinary identity.</p>
<p>In particular, one of the big men was even more powerful, with three layers of condensation. His eyes flashed with cold eyes and looked at Zhang daphou coldly. He turned a blind eye to other people around him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fart, it&rsquo;s reasonable to pursue my younger brother!&rdquo; Zhang daphou sneered. When his right hand was raised, he let out a cry. The big black pot behind him actually floated by itself. The momentum was like a rainbow, which made the people around him change their looks. But the big man&rsquo;s eyes shrank, he pinched a small flag in his hand and flew out. Bursts of fog scattered, and the roar of wild animals could be heard in the fog.</p>
<p>When the sword was drawn, Xu Baocai saw Bai Xiaochun walking out of the thatched cottage at a glance. All of a sudden, new hatred and old hatred welled up in his heart and roared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bai Xiaochun!&rdquo; Xu Baocai&rsquo;s body suddenly rushed out of his words. With a wave of his right hand, his wooden sword flew out immediately.</p>
<p>Zhang daphou and others changed their faces. When they were about to stop them, the big man in the supervisor room sneered and stopped them immediately.</p>
<p>But just at the moment when Xu Baocai&rsquo;s words just came out and his body rushed away, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s eyes were red and he also called out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Xu Baocai, you&rsquo;re pushing too hard. I&rsquo;ll fight with you!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s heart is pounding. He has never had a fight with anyone in his life, let alone fight with a monk.</p>
<p>At the moment, he was almost nervous. When he yelled out to strengthen his courage, the cultivation of three layers of condensation gas broke out. He put all his accomplishments into the wooden sword, controlled the wooden sword in his hand and pointed to Xu Baocai.</p>
<p>With the hum of the wooden sword, the two silver lines hidden on the colorful sword body flashed slightly, which made the sword body expand a large circle in an instant, burst out a terrible cold light, and went straight to Xu Baocai.</p>
<p>The speed and momentum of the sword surprised Zhang daphou and others as well as the people in the supervisor&rsquo;s room. What made them gasp was that the sword was so sharp that it shrouded all around. They couldn&rsquo;t care to fight with each other any more.</p>
<p>Before Xu Baocai rushed too close, he was first startled by Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s momentum. Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s appearance was totally different from his memory a few months ago. It seemed that he had changed a person, and that kind of gnashing his teeth and fighting hard made Xu Baocai surprised.</p>
<p>Then, his eyes suddenly widened, showing his incredible eyes. He saw the speed of Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s wooden sword flying, which almost formed a white competition. Especially the momentum of the wooden sword, which he had only seen in the fighting skills of other disciples, was shocked and his scalp became numb.</p>
<p>With a bang, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s wooden sword directly hit Xu Baocai&rsquo;s wooden sword. Xu Baocai&rsquo;s wooden sword trembled suddenly and could not stop a bit. From the tip of the sword, it broke apart inch by inch, and was completely destroyed in the blink of an eye, and became countless pieces of shooting back.</p>
<p>However, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s wooden sword, without any pause, rushed out and went straight to Xu Baocai. Xu Baocai was scared out of his wits. He used all his strength to dodge quickly before narrowly avoiding it. He was passed by by the wooden sword and stabbed on the big tree beside him.</p>
<p>With a bang, most of the big tree was directly broken open, and fell down directly, raising bursts of dust. At the same time, Xu Baocai also uttered a scream, blood splashed on his right arm, and he retreated quickly pale.</p>
<p>This is because Bai Xiaochun is not very skilled in controlling objects. Otherwise, that sword is enough to make Xu Baocai die without a corpse!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three layers of condensate!! It&rsquo;s impossible, it&rsquo;s impossible! &quot; When he looked at Bai Xiaochun, Xu Baocai had a look of ghost fear. If he could make the wooden sword so powerful, it would take at least three layers of gas condensation. He could not imagine that in just a few months, Bai Xiaochun had become so amazing. This reversed his cognition and made him unable to accept it. It was like a nightmare.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t say he was shocked here. At the moment, the big man in the supervisor&rsquo;s room and the people around him all took a breath. When they looked at Bai Xiaochun, they were very dignified.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To use the spirit to transform the front and disperse the sword light is a magic method that can only be formed when the skill of controlling the tripod with purple Qi is cultivated to the level of lifting heavy as light!&rdquo; The big man in the supervisor&rsquo;s room took a deep breath and looked at Bai Xiaochun with fear in his eyes.</p>
<p>They are all like this here, not to mention Zhang daphou and others. When they look at Bai Xiaochun one by one, their looks are also full of shock. When Bai Xiaochun condenses for three layers, they are aware of it, but the sword light on the wooden sword is scattered, and it obviously expands a circle. It is the first time that they know about Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>Even Bai Xiaochun himself was shocked by the power of the wooden sword. He looked at the collapsed tree and the pale Xu Baocai, and immediately burst into laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Xu Baocai, you are so weak, eat my sword!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun was excited. He found that he was so much stronger than Xu Baocai. He was in high spirits and went straight to Xu Baocai when he laughed.</p>
<p>Xu Baocai was swept away by Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s eyes, and his body trembled for a moment. Seeing Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s laughter and coming figure, he was immediately afraid and would run away.</p>
<p>But before she could escape a few steps, Bai Xiaochun came near and looked at Xu Baocai. She thought of the scenes in which she had been chased by this man and her hard work in these days. All kinds of bitterness turned into strength, and she kicked Xu Baocai hard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let you chase me again!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun clenched his right hand and hit Xu Baocai&rsquo;s eyes. Xu Baocai fell to the ground in a scream and was determined to resist. However, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s cultivation of condensing Qi had no power to fight back in front of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let you know that you are not a vegetarian Bai Xiaochun jumped up and trampled down, gnashing his teeth, punching and kicking, and Xu Baocai&rsquo;s howling continued.</p>
<p>The sound of banging spread all around. No matter the big men in the supervisor&rsquo;s room, or Zhang daphou and others, were staying there at the moment, watching Xu Baocai being beaten violently, and Bai Xiaochun, who was getting more and more excited.</p>
<p>But Xu Baocai&rsquo;s tears came down, and his inner grievance reached the extreme. He didn&rsquo;t believe that Bai Xiaochun had become so powerful in the past few months, especially the magic power of lifting heavy weights, which could not be formed without years or even longer attainments.</p>
<p>In his opinion, Bai Xiaochun clearly had a big beginning, and at the beginning he was so strong. Because of his despicable character, he pretended to be so weak. What&rsquo;s more, he pretended to be so like that he took it seriously.</p>
<p>Thinking of this, Xu Baocai felt sad from his heart and got angry. He was so angry that he fainted.</p>
<p>Seeing Xu Baocai in a coma, Bai Xiaochun patted his clothes. He stood up from Xu Baocai, raised his right hand, and immediately flew a wooden sword. He put it on the cuff, and put it in a lonely look. He tried to hide the excitement in his eyes.</p>
<p>The big man in the supervisor&rsquo;s room took a deep look at Bai Xiaochun. His face was overcast and uncertain, and finally gave a fist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Younger martial brother Bai&rsquo;s collection is really deep. I admire him.&rdquo; He said without any expression. He turned around without hesitation and took the comatose Xu Baocai away.</p>
<p>After all, Zhang daphou and others came to Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s side. When they looked at Bai Xiaochun one by one, they all showed a smile. After all, the supervisor&rsquo;s office was an outsider, while Zhang daphou and others knew Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s efforts over the past few months, and they were more convinced of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You boy, OK, that little half a year didn&rsquo;t waste your life!&rdquo; Zhang Da Pang patted Bai Xiaochun on the shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it. I&rsquo;m afraid of my life.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun raised his head triumphantly, such as a proud rooster, which made Zhang dapong and others laugh again.</p>
<hr>
<p>Once I read the book of eternity, the first complete week begins now. This week I am very eager to rush to the top of the double list!!</p>
