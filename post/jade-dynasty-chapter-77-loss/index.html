      <p>The bamboo shadow is whirling, and the sun is shining down, and it falls on the open space in the bamboo forest.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan looked at the bamboo forest in the distance and said in a low voice: &ldquo;actually, I sometimes think I&rsquo;m stupid. Elder martial sister she obviously likes elder martial brother Qihao, but I still However, at that time, I saw her standing in front of Kui Niu, and I didn&rsquo;t know what to think, so I rushed up. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I was in danger, would you come to save me like this?&rdquo; said Biyao, leaning against him</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan smiled awkwardly, grabbed his head, and said for a while, &ldquo;I, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; but after a pause, he thought about it carefully, and said, &ldquo;I think so!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biyao smiled and gave him a look. He took back his eyes and looked at the distance. He said quietly, &ldquo;if you are in danger, I am willing to give my life to you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was shocked and turned to look at her. She was quiet, but she didn&rsquo;t seem to be joking. Nah, what did you say</p>
<p>Biyao smiled and suddenly thought of something. She said to Zhang Xiaofan, &ldquo;Xiaofan, come with me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan frowned and said, &ldquo;where to go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biyao said: &ldquo;whatever, the world is so big that we can go anywhere.&rdquo;. If you don&rsquo;t want to join our saints and teachers as enemies, then we will not enter and travel all over the world together. Otherwise, if you stay in Qingyun gate, with the old-fashioned temperament, you will be in danger and fortune. &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan is silent. Biyao looks at him worried and waits.</p>
<p>Finally, Zhang Xiaofan looks at her. Biyao just wants to say something, but sees Zhang Xiaofan slowly shaking his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t leave Qingyun, Biyao.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biyao&rsquo;s face suddenly darkened and said, &ldquo;do you want to die here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was silent for a moment and said: &ldquo;Biyao, what you don&rsquo;t know, Qingyun is my home. I was raised by my master and my mother. I can&rsquo;t turn my back on them. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That master of yours scolds you all day long, and you say they are good?&rdquo; said Biyao angrily</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan stood up and said with a faint smile, &ldquo;Bi Yao. Maybe I&rsquo;m a little stupid in other people&rsquo;s eyes, but I can still see these things. Although my master is always stern, he is very kind to me. I know. He is sincere to me. &quot;</p>
<p>He said in a low voice, &ldquo;now these things are actually my fault. I lied to him, so I should be punished, but I must not betray the school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a long pause, Biyao suddenly sighed and said, &ldquo;where are you going to be stupid? You&rsquo;re smart! No wonder my father always said to me that you seem to be dull, but in fact, you are very smart! &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan stayed. A red face, said: &ldquo;he, your father he said that I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biyao smiled but didn&rsquo;t answer. She came to him and said, &ldquo;I know your temperament, and I can&rsquo;t force you to go. But now you are pregnant with our holy religion and have something to do with Tianyin temple. It&rsquo;s really dangerous. Do you have any idea what to do? &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan said with a wry smile, &ldquo;let it be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Baguio stared at him. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to be busy!&rdquo; she said softly</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan smiled, looked up at the sky and said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve been here for a long time, so go back soon! In case of any accident. We, if we are destined in the future Goodbye! &quot;</p>
<p>Biyao&rsquo;s body shakes. Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s heart is also bitter. He is not sure what will happen to his trip to tongtianfeng tomorrow.</p>
<p>Now he turned around and walked slowly out of the bamboo forest.</p>
<p>Just after he walked out for several meters, he suddenly heard the voice of Biyao coming from behind: &ldquo;Xiaofan. I ask you one thing. &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan turned around and said, &ldquo;what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biyao seems to have hesitated, but finally she says: &ldquo;in the forest outside Xiaochi Town, you once saw an ancient well on the night of the full moon. I want to know, what did you see in the ancient well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you want to know this?&rdquo; Zhang Xiaofan said</p>
<p>Biyao was a little nervous unconsciously, and said angrily, &ldquo;you say it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan frowned and said, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s so strange about that ancient well? Are you all so interested?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Baguio smiles without answering.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan opened his mouth to speak, but he didn&rsquo;t know what he thought of. He blushed again, but he didn&rsquo;t say it. After a while, he said, &ldquo;I will tell you when I meet you next time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After all, hearing Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s meaning, Biyao was not willing to be at the mercy of the school, so she said with a smile, &ldquo;OK! You have to remember! &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan laughs and talks with Biyao. His mood suddenly gets better and the whole person is relaxed. He reaches out his hand and waves to Biyao and turns to walk out of the bamboo forest.</p>
<p>Not far away, little grey monkey jumped from the top of which big bamboo, fell on Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s shoulder, and looked back at Bagao.</p>
<p>Deep in the bamboo forest, Baguio was staring at the back that was going away, motionless.</p>
<p>The next day, in the morning.</p>
<p>When the mountain is still floating on the bamboo peak with humid air, all the people of the bamboo peak have already got up.</p>
<p>It was not easy for Tian to stop. He and Su Ru walked slowly to the open space in front of Shoujing hall. They all waited here, and Zhang Xiaofan stood in the last position among them.</p>
<p>Tian is not easy to light way: &ldquo;Daren, you take the old seven, other people do not have to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren nodded and answered. Everyone else&rsquo;s face was disappointed, but Tian linger stood up and said, &ldquo;Dad, I want to go too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian is not easy to frown and say: &ldquo;what are you going to do to make trouble!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian ling&rsquo;er and Bei clenched their teeth and looked at Su Ru with imploring eyes. She called out, &ldquo;Niang.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru sighed and said to Tian, &ldquo;forget it, let her go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian not easy frowned, finally reluctantly nodded, then stopped looking at her, looked at Zhang Xiaofan in the distance, said: &ldquo;go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said, the sleeve robe a jilt, drove up the immortal sword, immediately flew away, Su Ru immediately followed up.</p>
<p>On the ground, all the disciples gathered around. He Dazhi coughed and said to Zhang Xiaofan, &ldquo;well, younger martial brother, be careful yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan, for the first time these days, saw the faces of all the senior brothers with a look on them. He was moved and whispered, &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren sighed and said, &ldquo;little martial brother. Let&rsquo;s go! &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan answered and went to song Daren. He couldn&rsquo;t help looking at Tian ling&rsquo;er who was standing beside him, but he saw that she also looked at him. His eyes were full of concern, but after all, he said nothing.</p>
<p>Shua Shua twice, Zhang Xiaofan once again stood behind song Daren, rising up into the sky.</p>
<p>Look at the increasingly blue color in the sky.</p>
<p>It seems that everything is like the beginning of the martial arts of the seven veins, but there is no original excitement.</p>
<p>Through the sky peak, towering into the clouds, towering, still so ethereal, still so untouched by half the worldliness, as if also open arms, welcome their arrival.</p>
<p>Song Daren takes Zhang Xiaofan and Tian linger to the sea of clouds. On the Yuqing hall in the distance, there was a distant bell ringing.</p>
<p>Tian not easy and Su Ru can&rsquo;t see people at the moment. Most of them have gone to Yuqing hall first, but on the sea of clouds, there are many disciples from changmen and other branches. At this time, when song Daren and others came, there was a commotion and many eyes turned to Zhang Xiaofan standing behind.</p>
<p>Countless whispers, above the sea of clouds. Like those floating clouds, floating around.</p>
<p>Song Daren and Tian linger are all taut, pretending to ignore the eyes of the people around them. A moment later, a man came out of the crowd. Towards the three of them.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan looked at him and recognized him. He was Chang Jian, a disciple of changmen who had seen him last time when he went to Tongtian peak. He was also a person who had made friends with song Daren in the seven pulse martial arts.</p>
<p>Song Daren knew the man himself. Seeing him coming, he bowed his hand and said: &ldquo;elder martial brother Chang. Are you all right? &quot;</p>
<p>Chang Jian hurriedly returned the gift, but he still glanced at Zhang Xiaofan for a few eyes. Then he said: &ldquo;elder martial brother song, just now, martial uncle Tian is here first. He specially told me to lead me to Yuqing palace as soon as several of you are here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren nodded and said, &ldquo;then please elder martial brother Chang.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Often arrow light smile, sideways way: &ldquo;that several please follow me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said that he should go first. Song Daren, Tian linger and Zhang Xiaofan followed him, crossed the sea of clouds, crossed the eyes of numerous Qingyun disciples, came to the side of Hongqiao, and walked up.</p>
<p>At this time, the first light of the morning finally shot into the world, gently sprinkled on the Tongtian peak, the clear water waves on both sides of the Hongqiao, and in the ripples of layers, a beautiful rainbow emerged.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan breathed deeply and looked into the distance. The boundless world, like an incredible huge picture, was only a little ornament in it.</p>
<p>They walked like this all the way through Hongqiao and came to the green water pond. They also saw the broad step leading to the Yuqing hall, but they didn&rsquo;t see the spirit animal water unicorn in Qingyun gate. They probably still lived in the green water pond!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dang!&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the Yuqing hall at the top of the mountain, there was a clear sound of bells and tripods.</p>
<p>Chang Jian smiled at them and said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s almost here. Let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren answered, but he couldn&rsquo;t help looking at Zhang Xiaofan, but he saw his younger martial brother looking at the top of the mountain, expressionless.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s much quieter here than in the sea of clouds. Almost no Qingyun disciples can be seen all the way. A few of the young paths that were cleaned, when they saw the regular arrow, all raised their palms to greet them.</p>
<p>One step, one step.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan is walking up slowly. People are getting higher and higher. But somehow, he feels his heart is getting deeper and deeper. The immortal place in front, closer and closer, made his heart beat faster and faster.</p>
<p>Unknown and inexplicable tension enveloped him. And what will be waiting for him?</p>
<p>On the Yuqing Hall of Tongtian peak, there was a distant bell, floating among the mountains</p>
<p>At the foot of Qingyun Mountain, in a remote place, there are four people standing side by side, three men and one woman, looking at Qingyun Mountain quietly.</p>
<p>For a while, the oldest poison god suddenly smiled and said, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect to come back here in my lifetime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Standing beside him, the ghost King smiled lightly and said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not surprising that you can not only come back here, but also come back to the top of Tongtian peak after a while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The poison God immediately shook his head and said with a smile, &ldquo;brother ghost king, haven&rsquo;t we already discussed it? This event is presided over by Taoist brother yuyangzi of the longevity hall. We are all pawns. &quot;</p>
<p>Then he turned his head and said to the man on the other side, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s right! Yuyangzi&rsquo;s brother, ha ha. &quot;</p>
<p>One of the four sects of the demon sect, yuyangzi, the head of the longevity hall, is extremely handsome with his eyebrows on his temples. It seems that people in their early thirties have been practicing for hundreds of years.</p>
<p>In the demon sect, longevity hall is a very special faction, because it has always been. This sect is responsible for guarding the most important holy place of the demon sect, the temple, in the wilderness. The purpose of this vein, like its name, is only to pursue longevity. It&rsquo;s just that they are among the four major sects of the demon sect, when they are acting. Many unscrupulous means are contrary to the way of seeking long life, which is said to be in the right way.</p>
<p>This time, the demon sect came to Qingyun Mountain in secret. Yuyangzi arrived here. After several times of secret discussions, he was elected as the leader of the event of the demon sect. He was inevitably proud of it. Then he said with a smile, &ldquo;Qingyun sect has been bullying our holy religion for hundreds of years. Today, we must ask for justice from them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost king said with a smile, &ldquo;well said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that, he turned his head. Smiling at the woman standing by all the time, the only female sect leader of the four sects and the three wonderful fairies of the joy sect, he said: &ldquo;wait a moment, it depends on the fairy&rsquo;s magic way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sanmiao fairy was born in the joyous sect, one of the most notorious sects in the demon sect. Her appearance is very beautiful, but she has no desire to show any emotion in the past. Her face is light and does not apply any powder. Instead, she has the beauty of ice and frost. It&rsquo;s similar to Lu Xueqi in xiaozhufeng on Qingyun Mountain.</p>
<p>Hearing the ghost King&rsquo;s words, Sanmiao fairy smiled lightly. &ldquo;The three Taoist brothers are all great people who have seen the world. They are far better than my little girl. But we all made a solemn oath in front of the Virgin Mary throne. We must work together this time. Yixue was ashamed of being humiliated in the temple in those days. I hope that the three Taoist brothers will abandon their previous suspicions together. Don&rsquo;t let the preface down. &quot;</p>
<p>The three ghost king looked at each other and said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t worry, fairy, we have no two minds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sanmiao fairy smiled and then turned to the ghost king. &ldquo;Brother DaoWang, I have been here for several days. Why can&rsquo;t I see my niece?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ghost king a Zheng, way:&rdquo; you say that Baguio that wench, the child is fond of playing, also don&rsquo;t know to run where to go, don&rsquo;t know what the fairy wants to find her</p>
<p>Sanmiao fairy said lightly: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s nothing, but I heard recently that Qianjin got a treasure. It&rsquo;s the Huan Huan bell handed down by Mrs. Jinling. Can it be true?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poison God and yuyangzi are slightly moved. It is obvious that the name of Mrs. Jinling, even for such a demon giant as them, can not be ignored.</p>
<p>When the ghost King&rsquo;s face changed, there was a gleam in his eyes. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where the fairy got the news?&rdquo; he said</p>
<p>Sanmiao fairy reached out her jade like hand, gently combed her hair and sideburns, and said expressionless: &ldquo;I naturally hear that.</p>
<p>Brother ghost king and Mrs. Jinling are the ancestors of our joy sect eight hundred years ago. The joy bells she left behind are always the treasure of our joy sect&rsquo;s town sect. Surely you know that, too? &quot;</p>
<p>The ghost king didn&rsquo;t speak, but he stood up with his hand in his hand. He had no sign of backing away. Just now, there was a harmonious atmosphere. Suddenly, there was a bit of tension.</p>
<p>Yuyangzi coughs and takes a look at poison God. Unexpectedly, poison God turns around and looks at the Qingyun Mountain in the distance. Obviously, he doesn&rsquo;t want to meddle. Yuyangzi scolded in his heart. If he had changed the past, he would have liked to fight with these two rivals first. But now that he is the principal of this time, he had to take a step forward and said: &ldquo;how can you say that and get angry? They are also good people. Now that the current situation is great, it&rsquo;s better to press it down first. When it&rsquo;s over, you can solve it by yourself. How about that? &quot;</p>
<p>Sanmiao fairy took a look at him, nodded slightly and looked away. The ghost king had no expression, but he sneered at him: yuyangzi was really not a good man, because he had to be persuaded because of his identity, but he had a hidden intention of provoking the two factions to fight each other after the event.</p>
<p>But the Huan bell is really a treasure. It has always been called the four magic treasures of the demon sect together with the &ldquo;Fu Long Ding&rdquo; of the ghost King clan, the &ldquo;phagocytosis blood bead&rdquo; of the blood refining hall, and the &ldquo;ten thousand poisons return to the clan bag&rdquo; of the ten thousand poisons sect. What&rsquo;s more, it has been said in the demon sect that many magic tricks and wonders in the joy sect need to be mediated by the Huan bell in order to play the greatest magic effect.</p>
<p>The ghost king would not be willing to hand over these treasures. Moreover, after Bagao got the treasure from the blood dripping hole under the dead spirit pit, he specially asked him not to speak out, but he did not know that the three wonderful fairies were good at it. He even heard about it.</p>
<p>In this moment, the ghost king thought over all the people around him, but he smiled a little and said, &ldquo;what brother yuyangzi said is that we might as well talk about it after this event.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yu Yangzi saw that these two people who had always been rebellious in the past actually listened to his words this time, and his heart couldn&rsquo;t help feeling a little complacent again.</p>
<p>At this time, poison god suddenly said: &ldquo;ah! The sun is out. &quot;</p>
<p>Hearing this, they looked at Qingyun Mountain together and saw a round of red light, rising slowly from the top of Qingyun Mountain in the distance and sprinkling the sun on the world.</p>
<p>The warm sunshine also shone on the four people, and pulled out a long shadow behind them.</p>
<p>After the last step, Zhang Xiaofan finally came to the outside of Yuqing hall again. This tall and solemn hall stands in front of him with great momentum. People stand in front of it as if they were ants.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go in!&rdquo; said Chang</p>
<p>Song Daren and Tian linger both nodded, saying that Zhang Xiaofan was just about to walk, when suddenly his body shook and his eyes looked aside. He saw a man sitting on the ground against the railing in the other corner of the steps. His clothes were still clean, but because he sat on the ground at will, there was some dust on the bottom. His eyes stared at Zhang Xiaofan blankly, and he murmured something?</p>
<p>He is Wang Er Shu who has been mad for many years.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was sad and wanted to go, but he was caught by song Daren. He whispered: &ldquo;little younger martial brother, let&rsquo;s go first! Don&rsquo;t let the teachers wait long. As for Uncle Wang, wait for you It&rsquo;s not too late to visit him when you come out. &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan stops and feels sad for a while, but he finally knows that song Daren is telling the truth. He is the one who treats sin. He nods and smiles at Song Daren. Standing on one side of Chang Jian&rsquo;s eyes, he whispered, &ldquo;two, if there&rsquo;s nothing wrong, let&rsquo;s go in and meet all the senior teachers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren agrees to go forward with Zhang Xiaofan, but Tian ling&rsquo;er frowns and says, &ldquo;senior teacher? Elder martial brother Chang, are there any other elders coming? &quot;</p>
<p>Chang Jian hesitated for a moment and said: &ldquo;yes, there are several monks from Tianyin temple. In addition, there are elders from burning incense valley. They all come to ask us about Zhang About younger martial brother Zhang. &quot;</p>
<p>Tian ling&rsquo;er lost his color and turned white. Song Daren frowned.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan came forward silently and said, &ldquo;elder martial brother Chang, let&rsquo;s go in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chang Jian looked at him and nodded, &ldquo;OK, come with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, he walked in first, Zhang Xiaofan took a deep breath and followed him with some heavy steps. After him, song Daren and Tian linger looked at each other and saw the anxiety and worry in each other&rsquo;s eyes, but they had no choice but to follow up.</p>
<p>Just when they entered the Yuqing palace, Wang Ershu, who had been sitting in the corner, looked at Zhang Xiaofan. At this time, Zhang Xiaofan disappeared in the Yuqing palace. Somehow, he also stood up shakily and grabbed the brain bag like a child. He even walked towards the Yuqing palace.</p>
<p>In recent years, Uncle Wang has been taken care of by Qingyun gate, and his madness has never been better. He wanders all day on the Tongtian peak, which is the sacred Yuqing hall in the eyes of ordinary Qingyun disciples. He often goes in, but he has never made a big mess. For a long time, no one cares about him.</p>
<p>At this time, he went in smoothly and cleanly and disappeared in Yuqing palace. (to be continued. )</p>
