      <p>In the past thousand years, the south bank has always been oppressed by the north bank. Most of the top ten disciples of the outer gate Tianjiao battle are the north bank disciples, which makes the south bank unable to raise its head, let alone the first place. For thousands of years, it has been taken away by the north bank.</p>
<p>Among them, there are four peaks on the north bank and three mountains on the south bank. However, a thousand years ago, only the South Bank of the three mountains was completely different from the present. Whether refining spirit or refining medicine, they can become the pillar of the sect. No one dares to provoke them. Qingfeng mountain, which cultivates swords, is called the most powerful mountain of lingxizong.</p>
<p>But now, for some reasons, the situation on the north bank has been reversed completely. After each victory, it has obtained a large number of resources, which makes the overall combat power more and more strong. In addition, the cultivation method of the north bank is completely different from that of the south bank, which makes the Lingxi sect and the north bank strong and dominant in many external sects and Xiuzhen families.</p>
<p>Lingxizong, south bank control things, north bank control animals!</p>
<p>For example, what Bai Xiaochun learned at the beginning was the skill of controlling the tripod with Ziqi, while in the north bank, what he learned was the skill of controlling the elephant through heaven!</p>
<p>Therefore, the Wanyao Pavilion in Xiangyun mountain contains not only five chapters on plants and plants, but also five chapters on spirits and animals!</p>
<p>In view of the thousand years of cross-strait war, the south bank has failed repeatedly. In particular, 30 years ago, only one person in the top ten was from the south bank. This made the leaders and elders of the three mountains on the south bank angry and went out in person, which led to the appearance of Shangguan Tianyou.</p>
<p>Shangguan Tianyou, LV Tianlei, and Zhou Xinqi are the assassin&rsquo;s mace prepared by the south bank this time. All of them were taken as disciples by the mountain leaders and cultivated carefully. Now their accomplishments are all eight layers of condensation gas, and in terms of combat power, they have been able to defeat many inner schools.</p>
<p>In particular, Shangguan Tianyou is amazing. He is good at the method of emptiness, and is known as the first Tianjiao in the outer gate of the south bank.</p>
<p>Lu Tianlei, who is good at Thunder, is also good at thunder. Even Xu Meixiang, his master, praises Lu Tianlei. He concludes that LV Tianlei must be in the top ten of Tianjiao war.</p>
<p>And Zhou Xinqi, who usually shows her attainments in medicine, is as powerful as Li Qinghou.</p>
<p>When Bai Xiaochun learned about these things from Xu Baocai, he felt resentful and felt that the north bank was too bullying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After I build the foundation, I must go to the outer disciples on the north bank and kill them well!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun had such a lofty feeling in his heart. As for the so-called south bank qualification war and the Tianjiao war after that, he had no interest at all.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun felt that this kind of fighting and killing was not in line with his own identity. He was a glorious disciple and a leader&rsquo;s younger brother. He had different generations. Bai Xiaochun felt that he should not compete with those younger generation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What should I do if I can&rsquo;t argue with you? It&rsquo;s not a shame for the leader. Forget it, I won&rsquo;t go.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun gave a dry cough. He felt that he had sacrificed so much for the leader, elder martial brother and the clan. He should be able to go to the master to offer incense and complain.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun wanted to be beautiful, but he didn&rsquo;t take it seriously. For the next two months, he always went to find Zhang daphou and asked him to refine his spirit. Every time, he didn&rsquo;t use Zhang&rsquo;s noodles. He refined them with turtle shaped pot. When he took it out, he immediately showed his excitement and ecstasy in front of him.</p>
<p>Zhang daphou was also very surprised at the beginning, but gradually, it was a surprise, and then he gradually became complacent. He was even used to it. He was also very sure that he was indeed a genius of alchemy.</p>
<p>Even with his strong self-confidence, his alchemy became more and more intense.</p>
<p>As time went by, a month later, the third day before the qualification war, Bai Xiaochun received a notice from zongmen that he must take part in the qualification war for the 8th condensate layer, and there is no room for mitigation.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun glanced at Yu Jian, gave a sigh, and continued to refine pills.</p>
<p>Three days later, in the morning, when the bell rang on the south bank, he walked unsteadily in the mountain gate, watching a large number of disciples of the outer gate marching forward with awe and awe. He braced himself up and followed the crowd.</p>
<p>After a short time, we arrived at a valley behind the three mountains on the south bank. There was a huge square with white jade paved roads, forming a huge square, and there were many coiled dragon pillars around it.</p>
<p>Between each two dragon pillars, there are still statues. These statues are all fierce animals, one by one lifelike, which makes the evil spirit spread in all directions, making the whole valley square in a state of killing.</p>
<p>On the surrounding mountain wall, there is a raised platform. At the moment, there are dozens of seats on the high platform. Not only Li Qinghou and Xu Meixiang are sitting upright, but also Zheng Yuandong, the leader of Lingxi sect, has arrived.</p>
<p>The qualification war between the two sides of the Strait is not held at the same time. The south bank is the first and the north bank is the second. Therefore, as the leader of Lingxi sect, he can&rsquo;t take sides with either side. At the moment, he first comes to the south bank to watch, and then he has to go to the north bank.</p>
<p>Li Qinghou and Zheng Yuandong are chatting with each other with a smile.</p>
<p>Behind them are the elders of the three mountains. Elder Zhou is also among them. One by one, they either keep their eyes closed, or talk to each other in a low voice, and others look down at the disciples who are constantly pouring in from below.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun looked lazy in the crowd. When he came to the square, he stood aside and looked around curiously. He had never been here before, especially the statues. He ran over and looked at them carefully and made a sound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These fierce beasts are as interesting as alive.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun even saw the hair on the statue of a fierce beast, which fluttered in the wind, which made him feel incredible.</p>
<p>Just then, all of a sudden, there were bursts of exclamations from the crowd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sister Zhou is here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elder martial sister Zhou has been to the eighth floor of condensate gas for a long time. In the first ten li of this time, there must be her. Even in her capacity, the first three are safe!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I saw a blue Ling whistling from the sky in the distance. In the twinkling of an eye, she turned into Zhou Xinqi&rsquo;s figure. She first held her fist to the high platform, and then she went to one side. She closed her eyes and looked calm. But there was tension in her heart. After years of practice, she was bound to win the qualification war.</p>
<p>On the high stage, Li Qinghou looked at Zhou Xinqi and gave a smile, showing appreciation in his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Qinghou, this week Xinqi not only has excellent vegetation, but also has astonishing accomplishments. If you want to come this time, you will surely be able to add brilliance to your south bank.&rdquo; Zheng Yuandong laughs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The headmaster has a high reputation. I still need to train my apprentice. However, her temperament is rare among her peers. She is a material that can be made.&rdquo; Li Qing Hou Qian said.</p>
<p>When the crowd around the square looked at Zhou Xinqi with envy, Bai Xiaochun glanced at Zhou Xinqi, coughed, and put on the same look as Li Qinghou, with his hands on his back, and his eyes showed admiration.</p>
<p>The discussion about Zhou Xinqi was not over. Suddenly, there was another uproar in the crowd. All of them looked up at the sky. There was a thunderbolt and a silver snake swam away. A young man in a blue shirt looked arrogant and stepped on a flash of lightning.</p>
<p>Behind him, countless lightning swam away, thunder roared, and the momentum was so strong that it surpassed Zhou Xinqi. When he stepped into the square, even within 10 Zhang around him, a thunderstorm formed, and a large amount of electric light spread around him.</p>
<p>On his body, the same arc of lightning around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Lu Tianlei from ziding mountain! Elder martial brother Lu has a rare thunder pulse. He has been practicing in seclusion since he was introduced. Today, he is so extraordinary! &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lu Tianlei is not vulgar. What kind of skills does he practice? He controls thunder and lightning to such an extent!&rdquo; When people around him were shocked, Lu Tianlei worshipped the platform with pride and turned to one side. In his eyes, only one of the outer disciples in the square could be Zhou Xinqi. As for others, he didn&rsquo;t pay attention to them.</p>
<p>On the stage, Xu Meixiang chuckles and her eyes show satisfaction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Headmaster, what do you think of my practice of controlling thunder with extreme Dao?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have two points of Lei Yi, with eight layers of condensate gas. With this accomplishment, this son is already the pride of heaven under the foundation.&rdquo; Zheng Yuandong moved slightly and looked at LV Tianlei a few times more.</p>
<p>At this time, the old man, who was thin and sharp, raised his head and looked into the distance with a smile on his mouth.</p>
<p>Zheng Yuandong immediately looked up, not only that, but all the elders around him were staring at the distance.</p>
<p>A sword light From the sky and the earth, endless clouds were set off and roared. The momentum was so strong that the clouds rolled over. You could see that there was a blue ancient sword inside, forming a green rainbow, which broke through all obstacles in an instant. It was like shuttling through nothingness and going straight to this place.</p>
<p>This sword is ancient and simple. It is made of bronze. It bears the meaning of time and is very popular.</p>
<p>On the flying sword, a young man was standing. He was dressed in the clothes of his disciples. His black hair was fluttering. His appearance was beautiful to the extreme. At the moment, he carried his hands behind his back, and his momentum was amazing. There was a light golden light on his body. Especially after him, Qinghong turned into green lotus, forming a vision.</p>
<p>In the rear, there is a beast with a head of fish body of three feet in size. It is as if the sky is turned into a sea, and there is rain in the area.</p>
<p>Before he could wait for him to approach, there was a wind and rain blowing on the square, which made countless disciples look up. Seeing this behind the scenes, they took a breath one after another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Shangguan senior brother!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;South bank outer gate first day pride, Shangguan Tianyou!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is said that he has the body of a sword spirit, and is a reincarnation body of some sword cultivation. For some reason, the heaven is guilty, so he has countless blessings in his life. When he is three years old, he can pick up the old broken sword. At the age of seven, the cub of a chiyun beast falls in the sky and recognizes him as the main one. When he is 13 years old, he is protected by golden light, so he is named Tianyou.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhou Xinqi opened her eyes and gazed at the sky, showing her solemnity.</p>
<p>In the distance, Lu Tianlei suddenly raised his head, flashed thunder in his eyes, and countless arc lightning swam away. His momentum was lifted and his eyes showed provocation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shangguan Tianyou, meet the headmaster, the master, the two palms, the elders.&rdquo; When the green rainbow comes, Shangguan Tianyou clasps his fist, bows to the high platform, falls quietly, and nods to the disciples around him with a smile.</p>
<p>His eyes were gentle. After he nodded to the crowd, he immediately attracted countless people to see him. There were also many young disciples who showed shyness when he looked at Shangguan Tianyou.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good, good, good!&rdquo; On the high stage, the leader Zheng Yuandong looked at Lu qimang and laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is rare that Shangguan Tianyou can do this before building the foundation, no matter whether he is reincarnated or not, even if he has the body of sword spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This time on the south bank, I&rsquo;m surprised.&rdquo; Zheng Yuandong looks at the palm seat of Qingfeng mountain and laughs.</p>
<p>Li Qinghou&rsquo;s three people all smile, and the elders behind them all smile one by one, which means they should be ashamed of the north bank.</p>
<p>Zheng Yuandong was about to continue to open his mouth when he saw a statue standing beside a statue on the square below, holding his hands behind his back and posing as an elder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bai Xiaochun It&rsquo;s pretentious. &quot; Zheng Yuandong gave a dumb smile.</p>
