      <p>Bai Xiaochun is a person who is very good at finding fun in everything At the moment, he found his pleasure as the leader&rsquo;s younger brother, so he was elated and swaggered along the mountain road of zongmen. From a distance, he saw the mission.</p>
<p>With a dry cough, Bai Xiaochun tidied up her clothes and put on a look of an elder. She raised her chin and slowly approached with her back.</p>
<p>The mission office is full of people. As the busiest places in Xiangyun mountain, there are a large number of disciples coming in and going out every day, and you can hear the roar of people from afar.</p>
<p>Soon, Bai Xiaochun came to the task. He stood there with a smile that he thought was kind and looked at the disciples.</p>
<p>Almost as soon as he appeared, someone noticed immediately, especially the group of disciples in front of him who were discussing the next task. Yu Guang was stunned when he got to Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s white Martial uncle, I&rsquo;ve met uncle Bai. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See Uncle Bai!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They quickly clasped hands with Bai Xiaochun. When the words came out, more and more people saw Bai Xiaochun. Soon, almost all the disciples from other schools in this area went to see Bai Xiaochun one after another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard work, everyone.&rdquo; That sentence of Uncle Bai&rsquo;s voice, listen to Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s heart is in full bloom, then smile to say hello to the people, carrying small hands, go forward.</p>
<p>And those outside disciples around, one by one, looked at Bai Xiaochun, showing admiration and whispering with each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle Bai, that&rsquo;s the leader&rsquo;s younger brother&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>In particular, several deacons of the mission office, after seeing Bai Xiaochun, all got up in a hurry to see Bai Xiaochun, making the whole task office no longer work. This scene made Bai Xiaochun more excited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You go on, don&rsquo;t worry about me. I&rsquo;ll come to see my Lingxi sect&rsquo;s disciples on behalf of the headmaster and senior brother today.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s heart was bursting with laughter. When he opened his mouth, the disciples around him met again. Even the elders in the Mission Office went out and nodded to Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>But Although Bai Xiaochun asked everyone not to pay attention to him, he did not leave here. Instead, he walked in the crowd and nodded with a smile. Everywhere he passed, the words &ldquo;Uncle Bai&rdquo; were constantly spread from all the disciples of other schools. Some of them even said more than ten times</p>
<p>Gradually, everyone&rsquo;s looks a little strange. We can see that Bai Xiaochun came here to listen to people calling him uncle Bai When Bai Xiaochun saw that he was good, he waved to the crowd and swaggered away, and the task Department resumed its operation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a great identity.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s eyes were shining. This morning, he felt happy both physically and mentally. More importantly, he found something different in his identity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glorious disciple, headmaster, younger brother, this identity does not mean that no one dares to provoke me in the sect since then?&rdquo; When Bai Xiaochun thought of this place, he laughed and ran to Wanyao Pavilion.</p>
<p>Wanyao Pavilion There are many of them.</p>
<p>After a while, Bai Xiaochun went to Wanyao Pavilion, looked at the ten stone tablets, and listened to the address of Uncle Bai. Bai Xiaochun was very sad. After a long time there, he lingered for a long time. Under the gradually strange look of the people, he was reluctant to leave. Although it was dusk, he did not know how tired he was and went to the place where a large number of disciples lived.</p>
<p>Xu Baocai just went out, he saw Bai Xiaochun face-to-face. He quickly clasped his fist to see him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Xiaobao. When I left half a year ago, there was no change in your cultivation. You can&rsquo;t do this. You should practice more.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun patted Xu Baocai on the shoulder and opened his mouth with an old spirit.</p>
<p>Xu Baocai was stunned for a moment and blinked his eyes. When he heard Xiaobao&rsquo;s name, his heart trembled. He was so big that his father called himself, but outsiders didn&rsquo;t call him that. At the moment, he felt uncomfortable, but he didn&rsquo;t dare to resist. He could only nod his head and say yes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I Well, my seat Bai Xiaochun suddenly found that he could not use the word &ldquo;I&rdquo; because of her own identity. So she thought of Li Qinghou&rsquo;s usual address and changed it to &ldquo;this seat&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not familiar with this place, Xiao Bao. Please take me here to familiarize myself with it.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun coughed and raised his chin with his little hand on his back.</p>
<p>Xu Baocai has no choice but to take Bai Xiaochun around here.</p>
<p>As the disciples of other schools came back, they were surprised to find that they saw Bai Xiaochun again. Many of them met Bai Xiaochun in the mission area and Wanyao Pavilion during the day. They all looked at each other and had to meet again.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun once again felt the glory of his identity. Looking at the visits of the disciples from other schools, he was elated. Until late at night, he left contentedly.</p>
<p>On the way, he passed by the place where Lingwei chicken was kept. Soon, the sound of seeing uncle Bai came out again. When he left, he carried two Lingwei chickens in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the advantage of identity. I used to eat chicken and needed to steal it. Now I take it directly. Hum, the leader is my elder martial brother. Who dares to provoke me?&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun hummed all the way back to his home.</p>
<p>The next morning, as soon as the sun came out, Bai Xiaochun got up in high spirits, tidied up her clothes, and put on a lot of looks in front of the bronze mirror, until she chose a position that was most in line with her identity and walked out.</p>
<p>He seems to regard this kind of thing as Career</p>
<p>This time, he did not go to the mission, but went to other places where there were many people on Xiangyun mountain, and even went to see Xiaobi of Xiangyun mountain</p>
<p>Throughout the day, he heard countless calls from Uncle Bai. Bai Xiaochun had the feeling that he had become an immortal and was in high spirits. So Day three, day four, day five</p>
<p>He walked for more than ten days in a row. At the end of the day, almost all the other disciples of Xiangyun mountain called Uncle Bai at least dozens of times. People were crazy about Bai Xiaochun. They just called a child &ldquo;martial uncle&rdquo; once, but they were more and more depressed.</p>
<p>Such a day, Bai Xiaochun every day is very full, he especially likes to meet acquaintances, every time, will come forward to say hello</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lot of nephews, don&rsquo;t go. Long time no see.&rdquo; One day, Bai Xiaochun saw Zhao Yiduo. As soon as her eyes brightened, she immediately stepped forward and grabbed each other. Zhao Yiduo heard these four words, and her face twitched.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle Bai, we I have met many times these days&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun blinked and coughed. When she was about to open her mouth, she suddenly found a figure not far away. After seeing herself, she immediately turned to go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh, isn&rsquo;t this the nephew of Zi Ang? Long time no see.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun quickly let Zhao Yiduo go and stopped Chen Ziang with a look of joy.</p>
<p>Chen Ziang is going crazy. He meets Bai Xiaochun at least three times every day these days As far as he knows, everyone in Xiangyun mountain who knows Bai Xiaochun is the same as himself. There is also an unfortunate guy who likes to call himself Lord wolf. It is said that he meets Bai Xiaochun at least ten times a day</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle Bai, that I have something else to do. Let&rsquo;s go first. &quot; Chen Ziang almost ran for his life and ran away.</p>
<p>More than ten days later, almost all the disciples of Xiangyun mountain pretended not to see Bai Xiaochun when they saw him. This scene displeased Bai Xiaochun and took more initiative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I see you are so familiar. Come here, please remind me whether we have met.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun caught one of Zhou Xinqi&rsquo;s admirers. In the Wai yuan disciple&rsquo;s sad face, Bai Xiaochun took him to one side and had a heart to heart talk for a long time. After the disciple had said uncle Bai for more than 30 times, Bai Xiaochun was content to let the sad faced outer disciple go.</p>
<p>But this is not the way. After seeing that many people are hiding from themselves, Bai Xiaochun thinks that he should be more active, so in the following days, he will cough to remind each other of his existence.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that the effect is so general that Bai Xiaochun is quite sad. Fortunately, in Xiangyun mountain, in addition to Du Lingfei, there is a girl. Bai Xiaochun thinks that she is very cute.</p>
<p>She is Hou Xiaomei. She appears in front of Bai Xiaochun many times every day. Without Bai Xiaochun coughing, she runs after Bai Xiaochun with a sweet and greasy voice and calls for martial uncle.</p>
<p>Looking around, the other disciples of other schools were sour, but Bai Xiaochun was more and more happy and proud. Moreover, Hou Xiaomei, who had been educated by Bai Xiaochun, had already worshipped the mysterious little turtle in her clan. Once, when she followed Bai Xiaochun, she asked Bai Xiaochun what she thought of the little turtle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little turtle? He is a mysterious and gifted man. He is a rare great man in Lingxi sect for thousands of years. He is like a white cloud in the sky and will let everyone look up to him! &quot; Bai Xiaochun gave a dry cough and boasted that he was a little tortoise in his heart. He made up his mind to tell Hou Xiaomei that he was a little tortoise. He made up his mind to find a moment of public attention and tell her his great identity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so. As many people and I have said, little tortoise is indifferent to fame and wealth, and pursues the ultimate of medicine. He is a character like white clouds in the sky.&rdquo; Hou Xiaomei&rsquo;s eyes were shining after listening.</p>
<p>There was a time when some people said that Bai Xiaochun was a little tortoise, but this statement was quickly denied by the public. After all, everyone had an imaginary little tortoise in their hearts. However, it seemed that they could not overlap with Bai Xiaochun. After all, the names of the ten steles of grass, trees, spirits and beasts were not recorded on the inscriptions, which were all symbols representing the way of medicine, so it was difficult to identify them.</p>
<p>When Bai Xiaochun heard Hou Xiaomei say so, she didn&rsquo;t pay too much attention to Zhou Xinqi, one of the five beauties in the south bank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what Zhou Xinqi looks like when she calls me uncle Bai.&rdquo; When Bai Xiaochun thought of this, she was suddenly excited, so she focused on finding Zhou Xinqi every day.</p>
<p>His kung fu paid off, until once he saw Zhou Xinqi flying across the sky on blue silk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Xinqi, my niece!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun yelled.</p>
<p>Zhou Xinqi on blue Ling looks ugly. She also heard about Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s past month. She knows that Xiangyun mountain&rsquo;s disciples have been talking about white change. Now, the words &ldquo;Xinqi&rsquo;s niece&rdquo; fall into her ears. She feels goose bumps all over her body. She quickly pretends not to hear it and accelerates ahead, but she doesn&rsquo;t expect Bai Xiaochun ran on the ground persistently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Martial niece Xinqi, come and talk about life with martial uncle.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun is elated and excited. He has been looking for Zhou Xinqi for a long time. Today, he finally meets him. How can he let go.</p>
<p>Zhou Xinqi gritted her teeth and sped quickly out of Xiangyun mountain, which avoided Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun looked at Zhou Xinqi&rsquo;s figure from afar and sighed, feeling a pity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s OK. I can fly, too. There are many opportunities for you to call me uncle Bai.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun is depressed. Seeing that it is late, she turns to find Du Lingfei.</p>
<p>As soon as Du Lingfei saw Bai Xiaochun, she covered her mouth and chuckled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle Bai, uncle Bai, uncle Bai&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun was immediately happy. The more he saw Du Lingfei, the more lovely he felt. However, a few days later, Du Lingfei was accepted as a disciple by an elder and arranged to go to Donglin city as the deacon of Lingxi sect in Donglin city. This is an excellent opportunity for Du Lingfei. Only a few years in Donglin city can he obtain enough qualifications, and the merits can be added together, or even directly Promotion to the inner door.</p>
<p>And in Donglin City, she has a lot of power, which will make her cultivation resources much better than in the clan.</p>
<p>After seeing Du Lingfei off, Bai Xiaochun continues to look for fun in Xiangyun mountain.</p>
<p>As time went by, another month passed. The whole Xiangyun mountain and the word &ldquo;Uncle Bai&rdquo; had become a taboo. Everyone would laugh bitterly when they thought of it.</p>
<p>Fortunately, at this time, Bai Xiaochun also felt that this could not go on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Bai Xiaochun, the younger martial brother of Lingxi sect leader, and the martial uncle of all his disciples. I am not just Xiangyun mountain. I should go to other peaks.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun thought for a while and went to ziding mountain</p>
