      <p>The wind blows, countless flowers shake together.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi stood in the sea of flowers with no expression, silently looking at the ghost that landed opposite her.</p>
<p>Faint fragrance, dark floating.</p>
<p>Ghost Li lightly shrugged his shoulders, small ash swished from his shoulders, opened his eyes to see the master, looked at Lu Xueqi in the opposite direction, grabbed his head, and ran to one side.</p>
<p>His eyes fell on the tall stone gate behind Lu Xueqi, and he suddenly smiled and said, &ldquo;this is what we are looking for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi stood in front of the stone gate, didn&rsquo;t smile or speak, just looked pale, and didn&rsquo;t know what she was thinking?</p>
<p>The ghost Li slowly walked up, in the mouth light tunnel: &ldquo;I want inside thing&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Choking!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tianya divine sword, like autumn water, lies between him and her, reflecting the figure of two people, shaking gently.</p>
<p>The ghost stopped.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi slowly looked up, pale as frost, and looked like a nine day fairy who didn&rsquo;t eat the fireworks between people. She was pure and gorgeous. Even her words at the moment were cold: &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t let this strange treasure fall into the hands of the demon cult, and then I will kill more innocent people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ghost Li looked at her, deeply, looking at her.</p>
<p>The woman is as beautiful and cold as she used to be. The years have not engraved any trace on her, but what about her heart?</p>
<p>He has changed, this woman&rsquo;s deep heart, but also changed it?</p>
<p>All of a sudden he smiled, but his eyes grew cold in the smile. He smiled and said, &ldquo;really? It&rsquo;s a coincidence. I&rsquo;ll take the unknown treasure and kill more people! &quot;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s body slightly shakes for a while, staring at the man in front. She doesn&rsquo;t talk anymore, but holds Tianya&rsquo;s hand tightly.</p>
<p>In the distance, there was a faint roar. The voice came from the deep fog under their feet. It seemed to be far away. It sounded like the roar of some wild animal.</p>
<p>A moment later, GUI Li and Lu Xueqi felt it at the same time. At the foot of this really towering tree, suddenly from the trunk came a slight tremor.</p>
<p>Guili and Lu Xueqi face slightly changed at the same time. This strange tree is too big to be imagined. Compared with the ordinary mountains, it can&rsquo;t be beat. Don&rsquo;t say it vibrates this tree. It&rsquo;s amazing to think of shaking it.</p>
<p>What kind of people are they? How can we hide the movement under their feet from them? It&rsquo;s clearly in the fog under their feet. Suddenly there&rsquo;s a great change, and I don&rsquo;t know what great force can shake the tree.</p>
<p>When they think about this, they are both quick witted people. They all think about this change, for fear that it may be related to the treasure house of the emperor in front of them.</p>
<p>Also at this time, the first sunshine in the sky slanted. Sprinkle on the flower sea about three feet in front of the stone gate.</p>
<p>The ghost Li body moves, then wants to have the movement, but Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s bright eyes flash, the day front divine sword horizontal in the chest, a horizontal body block in front of the stone gate of the heaven emperor&rsquo;s treasure house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to fight with you, you get out of the way,&rdquo; he said</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi looked directly into his eyes, without giving in, and said lightly: &ldquo;you killed me. It&rsquo;s over. &quot;</p>
<p>In the eyes of GUI Li, the red light is very bright. Suddenly, with a long roar, he flies up, and his whole body is full of dark green light. With a strong voice.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s face was as cold as ice. Tianya sword rose from the sky. Suddenly, she said coldly, &ldquo;why do you use the way of Qingyun gate when you are in the devil&rsquo;s way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ghost Li people in the middle of the sky, the hands devour the blood beads in front of the soul, and the red in his eyes. The evil spirit was very strong, and he said, &ldquo;what about the green cloud method and the evil cult? I usually kill people and take lives. What about you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the howling sound, the red light mingled with the clear light, and he immediately beat down.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s eyes flashed with anger, and he didn&rsquo;t give in half a minute. Tian Ya&rsquo;s divine sword came to meet him in the sky, and the two pieces of unique treasure collided with each other!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boom!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a loud sound, Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s body rose up. He was on the tree trunk, but he could not help but step back, and his face turned white. But I saw this cold woman, with a wrinkled willow eyebrow and a body rising with the sword. Centering on Tianya divine sword on her chest, the bright blue light suddenly spread out. She was even more pure and gorgeous in the sword light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I lost that war ten years ago!&rdquo; She was in the middle of the sky, staring at the ghost in front of her, slowly speaking word by word. At the same time, Tianya magic sword was urged by her own Taoist method, and the blue light was more and more abundant, as if even the sunlight in the sky was forced back by her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten years later, I&rsquo;ll ask you, the only one who integrates Buddhism, Taoism and magic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have a bad memory!&rdquo; he laughed</p>
<p>Speaking without hesitation, the soul devouring suddenly revolves in front of the body, the light bursts, the left hand even draws the strange figure formula, the clear and dazzling Taiji pattern flashes in front of the body in an instant, which is the authentic Taiji xuanqingdao magic of Qingyun gate.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s face was colder when she saw it. With a clear roar, Tian Ya&rsquo;s sword was full of brilliance. Between her wrists, it suddenly seemed that Tian Ya had grown ten times longer that day, and she split towards the ghost.</p>
<p>Guili&rsquo;s face changed a little. He also spent a lot of hard work on the Taiji Xuanqing road. Only with the power of Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s sword, he knew that in the past ten years, the road had made rapid progress. No one in the young generation of Qingyun sect could easily gather the Taiji Xuanqing road into such a pure and powerful sword. He just saw Shifu Tian when he was young It was only used once when it was not easy to teach Qi Hao a lesson. However, Tian&rsquo;s attainments in Taiji, Xuanqing and Daoism at that time had reached the &ldquo;upper Qing state&rdquo;.</p>
<p>At the moment, Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s sword is as sharp as a mountain and blue light is as sharp as a knife. Compared with the field of that year, it&rsquo;s not easy for her to surpass it. In the past ten years, she has made great progress in her Taoism, which is amazing!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s aptitude is amazing, but he has three magic skills. In the past ten years, he has been practicing hard day and night?</p>
<p>At the moment, I saw GUI Li face the mountain sword, his arms vibrate, and the Tai Chi pattern in front of him suddenly whirls rapidly, and quickly becomes bigger, blocking his chest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hiss!&rdquo; With a sharp sound, it seemed that the invincible sword was blocked by the Taiji pattern, but only the blue light was more abundant, the clear light was shining, and the brilliant light was shining between them. It was beautiful, but anyone knew it. If one is accidentally touched by the light of the sword which contains the true dharma of Taoism, he will be dead or wounded.</p>
<p>In the light, ghost Li exhaled. With a dull sound of &ldquo;boom&rdquo;, the divine sword flew back, and the Taiji pattern also flashed a few times before disappearing into the air.</p>
<p>Ghost Li hey, look at Lu Xueqi. There was a light color of admiration in his eyes, but he was immediately covered by red light. He said: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s really powerful. It took only ten years for you to break through the upper Qing Dynasty. I&rsquo;m afraid that the founder of Qingye was just like that, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi stood in the air, his clothes were floating, and his sword Jue was drawn. Tianya sword stopped immediately.</p>
<p>The blue light is more powerful than before, and at the same time, I am surprised. In the past ten years, her practice has been radical, although she has excellent qualifications, but what&rsquo;s more, she practices very hard, which can almost be described as excessive. As for why she is so reckless in practice, even her master, master Shuiyue, can&rsquo;t look down and persuade her for many times. The reason is not known to outsiders.</p>
<p>This kind of hard practice is combined with her excellent talent. Finally, half a year ago, she was the first among the young generation of Qingyun gate to break through the realm of the upper Qing Dynasty for thousands of years. The fastest person to reach this realm under the great master Qingye. In the Qingyun gate, except for the heads of the elders, she is afraid to be the leader in her Taoist practice. Even Xiao Yicai, who has always been known as the first young disciple in the gate, is a little inferior to her.</p>
<p>But. However, just now she was fighting with the spirit of the fierce, this was originally called Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s ordinary Qingyun disciple, Taoism is no less than her. That hand&rsquo;s magic Tai Chi pattern is mature and sophisticated, which blocks her sword containing the Taoist method of the upper Qing Dynasty. In the meantime, it&rsquo;s dark and turbulent. It&rsquo;s strong and solid, but it seems that it&rsquo;s a school of Buddhism. But judging from his practice, it&rsquo;s clear that it&rsquo;s the gestural formula of the Xuanqing Dao of Tai Chi.</p>
<p>Did this man finally walk out of the road that his predecessors had not taken?</p>
<p>Two people look at each other, eyes are gradually sharp and bright, but at this time, suddenly a loud roar, from the fog roared up!</p>
<p>The voice is so fierce and loud. In the practice of GUI Li and Lu Xueqi, they feel slightly dizzy. Almost at the same time, the trunk under their feet suddenly shakes violently.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like that the thick earth suddenly shakes violently, which is similar to the feeling of an earthquake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Squeak, squeak!&rdquo; There was a scream, but the monkey Xiaohui was lying beside the stone gate of the Tiandi treasure house, frightened by the sudden vibration. He grabbed the vine beside the stone gate and cried out at the same time.</p>
<p>Before GUI Li and Lu Xueqi could react, from the direction of this huge tree trunk, four figures suddenly appeared, flying quickly, one in front, three in the back, flying to the neighborhood in a flash, Lu Xueqi and GUI Li looked there, all in a daze.</p>
<p>And the four people who came all the way suddenly found that someone was ahead of them. They were also surprised and stopped.</p>
<p>These four people are familiar with each other. In front of them is a young woman with a soft and charming style. It&rsquo;s the Golden Vase of the joy sect of the demon sect, and behind her is the right person. Not only does Lu Xueqi know them, but even GUI Li know them.</p>
<p>FA Xiang, Zeng Shushu, and Lin Jingyu, who stopped in amazement and never looked away!</p>
<p>All of a sudden, there was silence.</p>
<p>The fierce eyes looked at them, and the faces of Faxiang and others all showed complex looks, like joy, like astonishment, all kinds of looks flashed one by one.</p>
<p>Jinpinger&rsquo;s eyes glanced at the scene. With the position and power of Guili in the ghost King clan, his origin, jinpinger naturally knew about Guili. She knew something about the past of Guili and the righteous people present.</p>
<p>At the moment, looking at the situation in the field, she pondered a little, and her feet had moved quietly to the ghostly place, standing with him.</p>
<p>Right there, FA Xiang and Lu Xueqi see the action of Jin Ping&rsquo;er, and they all frown slightly, but they still don&rsquo;t speak.</p>
<p>What breaks the silence is Lin Jingyu standing at the back.</p>
<p>In his eyes, it seems that there is no figure of jinpinger at the moment, only Zhang Xiaofan standing in front of him. He slowly walked on a few steps, the corners of his mouth moved, it seems that he even felt a little difficulty in speaking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You Are you ok? &quot;</p>
<p>Ghost Li slowly took back his eyes, and no longer looked at him. Facing Lin Jingyu, he suddenly did not dare to look into the eyes of his childhood friend.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu looked at GUI Li&rsquo;s face, even more excited. His words seemed to be hoarse: &ldquo;Xiao Fan, you&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as the body shook, the ghost could not help but raise his head. It was the familiar face that caught his eyes. At the moment, there is no hostility, only excitement and joy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jing Yu&hellip;&rdquo; He said astringently.</p>
<p>In the past ten years, Lin Jingyu has cultivated in the ancestral hall of Qingyun Mountain. He has also imagined the scene of his meeting with Zhang Xiaofan again countless times. He has also asked himself constantly. How can I face Zhang Xiaofan who has been possessed by the devil?</p>
<p>Is the good and evil not two, draw a sword to decide life and death?</p>
<p>Or is it hard to persuade him to return to the right path?</p>
<p>But when we finally saw each other today, he couldn&rsquo;t say a word. The years passed by.</p>
<p>In the end, it was not Qingyun Mountain, sword flying, heaven and earth, but two childhood friends who ran with laughter in that dilapidated grass Temple!</p>
<p>Time is like sand, but have you ever worn away the most cherished things in your heart?</p>
<p>Childhood friends, once brothers, ten years later, stand in front of themselves.</p>
<p>Take a step. Lin Jingyu&rsquo;s face was so excited that he seemed to be moved even by the spirit, and his body trembled slightly. Perhaps, in the ghost Li&rsquo;s heart, is also the general excitement?</p>
<p>Jin Ping&rsquo;er&rsquo;s eyebrows slightly wrinkled as she stood beside GUI Li. She naturally had no interest in the feelings of the two brothers. However, it seems that there are many people in the right way. If there is any problem with GUI Li, she can&rsquo;t help herself.</p>
<p>Cough now. Smile: &ldquo;ah! Young master GUI Li, I didn&rsquo;t expect you to arrive here earlier than us. I don&rsquo;t know that strange treasure you can get? &quot;</p>
<p>As soon as this speech comes out, Lin Jingyu and GUI Li are shocked. FA Xiang and Zeng Shushu look at Lu Xueqi at the same time. Lu Xueqi slowly shakes his head, and they just let go.</p>
<p>A simple question, suddenly pulled people back to reality, the ghost slightly closed his eyes, a moment later, when he opened again, there was a faint flash of red. His eyes also sharpened. He took a deep look at Lin Jingyu and finally turned his head. Instead of looking at him, he stepped back and stood side by side with Jin pinger.</p>
<p>The gold bottle son smiled slightly, the vision is full of water, the eye wave flows, as if all sprinkled on the body of the ghost, soft voice way: &ldquo;are you ok?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ghost Li hum a:&rdquo; you and I temporarily cooperate, how</p>
<p>&ldquo;OK, I&rsquo;ll talk about it later,&rdquo; said Jin Ping&rsquo;er at once</p>
<p>Ghost Li looked at her, nodded, only a moment, the two people have seen that the scene is not easy with, so immediately decided to join hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t there many experts under the Hehuan sect?&rdquo; said the ghost? How can you be the only one who enters the nezer, but they have the upper hand? &quot;</p>
<p>Jinpinger glanced at the people of Fabian, but there was a little red shyness on his face. It was even more lovable. He whispered: &ldquo;our joyous sect is a small sect. I&rsquo;m afraid that I&rsquo;ll bring more people in, and those people outside will die suddenly</p>
<p>She smiled and looked at GUI Li, saying: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the ghost King clan that always hides dragons and lies in tigers. How can there be no one around him except a grey monkey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost Li listens to her words to have the ironic meaning faintly, light way: &ldquo;everybody this mutual, I bring a few talented person to come in more, just afraid the person horse outside is swallowed by your joy sect and ten thousand poison gate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This time, the three great sects of the demon sect came to the West in a large scale. On the surface, they worked together to eliminate the immortal hall, but secretly they were intriguing and wary of each other, so that the three great sects held each other in check. They dared not use all the experts in their seats, but they were taken advantage of by the right people.</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu stood in the distance, and he was very excited. When he was on Qingyun Mountain, he and Zhang Xiaofan had always made good friends, which was regarded as Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s best friend besides Lin Jingyu. How can the world change people&rsquo;s situation? I feel sad.</p>
<p>He was trying to say something to Gui Li, whether it was useful or not, to get his friend back on track. Just in a flash, his eyes fell on the face of the gold bottle, and his heart suddenly jumped. He only felt that the woman&rsquo;s face was like peach blossom, with boundless amorous feelings, and a pair of bright eyes were more like a pool of water. When he looked back, he seemed to be able to speak and stare at himself vaguely.</p>
<p>He looked at it for a few times, and then he felt a loud sound in his head, as if he was drunk. He just wanted to get drunk into the woman&rsquo;s eyes, and couldn&rsquo;t help but take a step.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Toot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly, he stopped drinking, like the evening drum and the morning bell, which suddenly rang in his ear, and the white monk robe of FA Xiang flickered, suddenly appeared in front of him, blocking the eyes of Jin Ping&rsquo;er, and at the same time, he faced Zeng Shushu&rsquo;s roar of subduing the devil.</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu was horrified, and then he came back to his senses. For a moment, he was covered with cold sweat. He thanked the Dharma in his mouth, and cursed in his heart: &ldquo;this demon girl is so terrible!&rdquo;</p>
<p>FA Xiang&rsquo;s face is grim. He turns around and stares at Jin Ping&rsquo;er. Just before he came up, Jin Ping&rsquo;er had already dealt with these people. He knew that the monk was not old, but he was really good at the Buddhist practice of Tianyin temple. His charming magic had little effect on him. It must be that he was too determined to be disturbed by such foreign things. He smiled and didn&rsquo;t speak at the moment 。</p>
<p>FA Xiang frowned and looked back at Zhang Xiaofan. Facing Zhang Xiaofan, he didn&rsquo;t look so calm. His always peaceful and compassionate face had a faint sense of guilt. After a moment of hesitation, he whispered: &ldquo;younger martial brother Zhang&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name is GUI Li, there is no other name,&rdquo; said GUI Li suddenly coldly</p>
<p>The Dharma phase smothers for a while, and the later Zeng Shushu can&rsquo;t help crying out: &ldquo;Xiaofan, don&rsquo;t do this, we still think you are&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>FA Xiang suddenly waved and stopped Zeng Shushu&rsquo;s words. At the same time, he said in a low voice: &ldquo;there are some words you can&rsquo;t talk about. In case your elder Qingyun knows about it, I&rsquo;m afraid there&rsquo;s still a disaster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu was stunned and looked at the ghost before him. Finally, he closed his mouth.</p>
<p>FA Xiang turned around and seemed to want to say something to Gui Li, but at this time, suddenly, the huge trunk under the feet of all the people was shaking violently again. This shaking intensity was much greater than that of a long time ago. Almost all the people saw the trunk shaking in the air, but they could not stand at the same time, most of them faltered a few steps.</p>
<p>People lose color almost at the same time.</p>
<p>At the same time, there was a loud roar in the fog below. It was like a fierce animal roaring to the sky. The invisible sound turned into a strong wind, surging from the bottom to the top, making the hunting sound of everyone&rsquo;s clothes.</p>
<p>And in the hiss and roar, at the same time, there was a strange and inexplicable &ldquo;silk&rdquo; sound, like the snake crawling, like the sound of rope friction, echoing between the heaven and the earth, more and more loud, more and more close.</p>
<p>Gold bottle son loses voice suddenly way: &ldquo;bad, it is that brute, it unexpectedly came up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the people in the scene, except GUI Li and Lu Xueqi, suddenly lost their color.</p>
<p>However, jinpinger&rsquo;s face turned pale and his heart was shocked. Although he was too friendly with the woman&rsquo;s enemies, he also knew that jinpinger was a figure to be reckoned with. In the battle of joint elimination of the longevity hall several days ago, the woman was careful in talking and laughing, and the means were cruel, which was really not easy to deal with.</p>
<p>But at this moment, even on her face, there seems to be some fear.</p>
<p>In the air, suddenly there was a more fishy smell, accompanied by the gradually loud, strange sound like the devil&rsquo;s footsteps in their hearts, more and more intense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is this&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ghost Li just asked half, suddenly stopped not to say, eyes straight to the front. Then, subconsciously, he even looked to the side, where Lu Xueqi, dressed in white as snow, suddenly looked to him.</p>
<p>In the clear sky, the direction of the huge branches, where there were some clouds at first, suddenly seemed to burn two huge flames.</p>
<p>Green flame!</p>
<p>In the fire, there are two long and thin deep eyes, shining with cold light.</p>
<p>The fishy smell in the air is suddenly strong, and I feel like vomiting.</p>
<p>For a long time, he looked at the giant beast that slowly appeared in front of him.</p>
<p>He hoarse voice, as if echoed in the past years, with only their own voice, murmured: &ldquo;black water snake, black water snake&hellip;&rdquo; (to be continued. )</p>
