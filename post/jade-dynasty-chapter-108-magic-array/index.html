<p>The main hall of the ghost King sect is located.</p>
<p>Under the desolate mountains, the general Hall of the ghost king is hidden in the hard caves. In the winding tunnel, in a deep and quiet place, there is no one in the long tunnel. Only the stone walls on both sides are inlaid with a copper lamp every few feet, illuminating some places.</p>
<p>You Ji, with a black veil on her face, wanders forward alone, looking like a ghost in the dark.</p>
<p>This place is already the forbidden area of the ghost King clan. It is the most mysterious place in the ghost King clan as well as the ice cave where Biyao lives. It has always been forbidden for ordinary disciples. But you Ji, as one of the four holy envoys of the ghost King clan, is one of the core members of the ghost King clan, so she can enter and leave these places freely.</p>
<p>However, she took a look at the deep tunnel, which seemed to be endless, and her pace slowed down suddenly. It seemed that she hesitated a little, but she finally walked.</p>
<p>Deep in the shadow in front of us, there seemed to be some weird low growls, like the roar of some wild animal.</p>
<p>After walking through a long tunnel, the lights on both sides are getting dimmer and dimmer. Finally, after turning a corner, you Ji comes to the end of the tunnel, where there is a stone gate with three words engraved on the lintel:</p>
<p>Trapped in the Dragon Palace.</p>
<p>You Ji stared at the three words for a long time, and there was silence around her. Only the strange roar that had been heard from time to time just now became clear. The air seemed to be filled with a faint smell of blood.</p>
<p>The black veil on her face moved, as if shaking her head, sighing softly, and entering the stone gate.</p>
<p>As soon as I entered the stone gate, it was suddenly open. Inside it was a huge grotto. The strange rocks on the side of the grottoes were abrupt and of different shapes. In front of the stone gate where you Ji is standing, there is a stone path hanging in the air, winding forward. To the center of the grottoes. At this moment, she was in the mid air of this huge cave.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s obviously not the first time you Ji has come here. Seeing such scenes, she is not surprised. After a moment&rsquo;s silence, he walked along the narrow stone path. The upper part of the Grottoes is dark, but just below the stone path, there is a faint red light shining and reflecting. On the contrary, the cliff above the Grottoes is somewhat ferocious.</p>
<p>The smell of blood in the air is more and more heavy.</p>
<p>The suspended stone path in this huge grotto, I don&rsquo;t know whether it was formed by nature or made by man, just like this, hangs in the air. Looking from afar, there is no pillar to support under it, which is unimaginable.</p>
<p>You Ji&rsquo;s black figure is walking on the stone path, but there is no sound of footsteps. It&rsquo;s kind of ghostly. But before long, she saw the figure in front of her.</p>
<p>Ghost king.</p>
<p>At the end of the stone path is a seven foot stone platform. The ghost king is standing on it at the moment, standing with his hand in his hand. Looking from behind, his figure is steady and thick. It seems that he has a strange feeling of integration with this huge grotto.</p>
<p>Youji went behind him and whispered, &ldquo;Lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost king turned around and nodded. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re here,&rdquo; he said with a smile</p>
<p>The black gauze on Youji&rsquo;s face suddenly gives a meal, which seems to be a surprise. Stone path to this platform, even at the end, the front is empty. Correspondingly, the mysterious red light under the grottoes also brightens up a lot from here. This time, the ghost king turned his head, and the red light suddenly came from his turning, vaguely blurring his face, even his eyes. There seems to be a light red awn.</p>
<p>The ghost king did not seem to notice these, only said: &ldquo;you come here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You Ji walked past, stood on the platform, immediately before her eyes, there was no stone path to block the things at the bottom of the grottoes.</p>
<p>There is a huge blood pool under the grottoes. The bright red blood fills the bottom of the huge grottoes. I don&rsquo;t know where the ghost King clan got so much fresh blood. The strong smell of blood in the air comes from below.</p>
<p>In the blood pool, there are two huge beasts, one is the yellow bird in the dead swamp, the other is Kui Niu, a strange beast on Liubo mountain in the East China Sea. Most of the bodies of these two ancient strange beasts were soaked in blood water, and a dark red light covered them from above the blood pool. Look at the place where the dark red light is coming from. It&rsquo;s the Dragon tripod that is suspended in the sky by inexplicable force.</p>
<p>The location of Fulong Ding is far away from the place where the ghost king and Youji stand, but Youji can still see a black figure on the Fulong Ding is practicing, but it is unclear under the cover of the red awn. But even so, she still knows who it is - Mr. GUI, the most mysterious figure in the ghost King clan of the demon sect.</p>
<p>As one of the four great emissaries of the last generation of the ghost King clan, you Ji is almost familiar with the big and small matters of the ghost King clan, but only this Mr. ghost is the exception. The reason is very simple. This man was not originally a figure in the ghost King clan. However, after the modern ghost King ascended the throne, a mysterious figure suddenly appeared beside him. The ghost King respected him very much, and the mysterious figure appeared in the hands of a few times. The weird Taoist techniques displayed by the mysterious figure also moved the experts of ghost King sect such as Qinglong and Youji.</p>
<p>But in Youji&rsquo;s mind, she always has a deep sense of vigilance towards this person. The most important reason is that under the strong promotion of Mr. GUI, the ghost King finally started the &ldquo;four spirit blood array&rdquo; ten years ago.</p>
<p>Fu Long Ding, the magic weapon of Zhenzong passed by the ghost King clan, has a mysterious origin. It contains endless spiritual power, which is neither positive nor evil, and extremely strange. In addition to the ancient and humble patterns, there are many mysterious inscriptions carved on the body of the Dragon tripod, which can not be seen through by the ancestors of the ghost King clan. However, in the present generation of ghost king, he is an all encompassing and unrivalled genius. At the same time, a ghost gentleman who seems to be specialized in the study of this kind of mysterious characters suddenly appears beside him. The two people work together to solve these mysterious characters.</p>
<p>It turns out that the inscription on the body of the Dragon tripod records a strange array called &ldquo;four spirit blood array&rdquo;. It needs to use four kinds of strange animal spirits in ancient times to trigger the strange magic power of the Dragon tripod itself, and then it will become a unique array with incomparable power. According to the ancient Ding Ming text, once the four spirit blood array is formed, its power will be enough to destroy the sky and destroy the earth.</p>
<p>The king of ghosts is a powerful and powerful hero. He will not turn a blind eye to this powerful force. Ten years ago, in the battle of Qingyun, Qingyun sect killed the immortal sword array. It was invincible and could not be resisted by human power. The king of ghosts carefully thought about it, and only these four spirit blood arrays. Only in this way can we defeat the immortal sword array.</p>
<p>Since then, all the actions of the ghost King clan began to revolve around the four spirit blood array.</p>
<p>You Ji takes back her eyes from Mr. GUI&rsquo;s vague figure and looks at the two spirit beasts in the blood pool. Though surrounded by blood and water. But I don&rsquo;t know how many years the yellow bird is obviously unwilling to live. From time to time, it gives out a roar of anger, its wings spread, and it makes a huge wave of blood and water around it.</p>
<p>But the blood in the blood pool seems to have a strange restraining effect on it. The power and power of the yellow bird are obviously far from the same day. Especially on its head, there was a dark red light from the Dragon tripod.</p>
<p>As soon as the yellow bird changes, the dark red light is bright. The yellow bird shrouded in it is like being suppressed by Mount Tai. Its just raised body is like being crushed back by the unrivalled gravity.</p>
<p>After so many rounds, the action of the yellow bird also gradually slows down. Although it is still fighting, it is increasingly powerless. At the other end of the blood pool, Kui Niu, a huge one legged animal, was immersed in the blood pool, motionless. Only eyes occasionally look at the yellow bird, I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;ve been trapped here for a long time, and I&rsquo;ve completely given up resistance.</p>
<p>Looking at the end of the two monsters, you Ji can&rsquo;t help but frown under the black veil and feel a strange antipathy.</p>
<p>Standing beside her, the ghost King seemed to feel something. Looking at her, he suddenly said, &ldquo;what are you thinking?&rdquo;</p>
<p>You Ji is surprised, immediately calm down, light way: &ldquo;nothing, patriarch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost king looked at her. Then his eyes moved to the blood pool, and after a while, he said slowly: &ldquo;now the four spirit blood array is half finished. As long as we find another two spirit beasts as the guide, we will be the day when the king of the ghost will reign in the world. It&rsquo;s just around the corner. &quot;</p>
<p>You Ji is silent for a moment, light voice way: &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost king stood with his hands on his back, his eyes still on the two spirit beasts in the blood pool, but suddenly changed the topic in his mouth, and said: &ldquo;you come to the dead water before me, and I charge you to observe the ghost in secret. Do you have anything to say to me? &quot;</p>
<p>The black veil on her face moved slightly. A moment later, she said: &ldquo;he led his subordinates around the ten thousand poisons sect, the joy sect and the right way in the dead water. Under the complicated and mysterious situation, there was still evidence to go back and forth, and finally joined hands with others to destroy the hall of eternal life, which was really the talent of the general. And&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>When she said this, she suddenly stopped. The ghost king was a little surprised and said, &ldquo;how is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Youji hesitated for a moment and said: &ldquo;he was in the inner water, and suddenly attacked Qin Wuyan, who was seriously injured by the ten thousand poisons gate. His mind was stoic and cruel, and he could not be underestimated.&rdquo; Said, you Ji suddenly in the heart a trance, oneself is talking about this person, really is that Zhang Xiaofan?</p>
<p>Is the person that Biyao really loves really him?</p>
<p>However, the ghost King seemed quite satisfied and nodded: &ldquo;this man is really a rare talent with a stoic and resolute disposition. In recent years, he has practiced my holy education skills, and has the unique evil weapon day and night. He is violent and easy to kill, which is normal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You Ji looks up and looks at the ghost king. There is a faint smile on his mouth, but against his calm and powerful face, there is a chill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said the ghost king suddenly, &ldquo;when I heard that Gui Li was in the dead water and met with those people in the right way, especially a Qingyun disciple named Lu Xueqi, his situation was a little different, but it happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>You Ji&rsquo;s body shakes, but she sees the ghost King&rsquo;s face is indifferent, and she can&rsquo;t see what he is thinking, but she doesn&rsquo;t know how, and suddenly there is a disorder in her heart. She and Qinglong sneak into the dead water. There is a subtle relationship between GUI Li and Lu Xueqi. Most of them are seen in the dark. Just want to come at the moment, but she felt a strange heartache.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a sharp needle. It goes into the heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; The ghost King turns around and looks at you Ji.</p>
<p>You Ji slowly lowers her head, because the black veil covers her face, no one can see her expression. After a while, her voice seemed to be hoarse, but still very clear and indifferent, answering the ghost King:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, there is some ambiguity between him and Lu Xueqi of Qingyun gate. I saw with my own eyes that he risked his life to save the woman in the face of black water and black snake outside the treasure house of the emperor of heaven!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost king didn&rsquo;t speak any more, but only in a moment, the bloody atmosphere around him suddenly became ten times and one hundred times stronger. The man still stood with his hands on his back, but I don&rsquo;t know if he was illuminated by the red light under the grottoes. His eyes were red and bright.</p>
<p>Youji slowly salutes the ghost king and walks back. Slowly walked out of this faint and breathless grotto.</p>
<p>Just when she came to the stone gate, she suddenly froze. Qinglong stood quietly outside the stone gate and looked at her lightly.</p>
<p>You Ji meets his eyes, and they look at each other like this. I haven&rsquo;t spoken for a long time.</p>
<p>After a while, Qinglong slowly came forward, passed her by, and walked to the deep cave, leaving Youji alone. Standing in the tunnel.</p>
<p>From the beginning to the end, he didn&rsquo;t say a word to you Ji.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>The moon in the south of Xinjiang hangs in the western sky.</p>
<p>The ancient temples in the deep mountains are full of bleak insects and gloomy scenery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoo!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a roar and a flash of light, Lu Shunyu&rsquo;s sword came and fell into the courtyard of the ancient temple. His eyes were shining and he carefully swept towards the main hall of the ancient temple one by one.</p>
<p>He had just searched the neighborhood for ten li with his sword.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t see a figure, but suddenly I realized that the ancient temple was my own negligence.</p>
<p>The night wind was cold, and even the gate of the abandoned hall had disappeared. Although it was not long ago, Lu Shun was still talking with people in the hall. Just at the moment, it suddenly became gloomy, as if something was peeping at him in the dark.</p>
<p>A little cold sweat came out of his palm.</p>
<p>The monster that died just now is the clan leader of the southern barbarian mermen. This time, I was sniped by someone when I met with him. I really can&rsquo;t get off the hook. He knew that there was a mysterious communication between the southern barbarians and his own school, and he knew more about the horrors and cruelties of those barbarians. If he didn&rsquo;t explain to the barbarians this time. I&rsquo;m afraid I will suffer.</p>
<p>However, based on his understanding of the southern barbarians, the fighting power of these fishermen is not so small. Although they are not as good as those who have advanced cultivation, they should kill in one move. The way of the sniper is so high that they are afraid that they are not under their own.</p>
<p>Lu Shun inhaled deeply. Suddenly, he said in a high voice, &ldquo;who is that, please come out and speak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speak Speak&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>With the end of his voice, the night wind gently floated in the middle of the ancient temple, but there was still silence in the hall, without any sound.</p>
<p>Lu Shun&rsquo;s face was more heavy. He bit his teeth. The immortal sword in his hand was shining brightly. The sword of man rushed into the hall. When he ascended the hall, it became bright. But just as other people&rsquo;s shadow had entered the hall, two dark shadows left the hall quickly and silently on one side of the ruins of the hall.</p>
<p>For a long time, I only heard Lu Shun look around the hall, banging for a long time, but finally came out, obviously nothing. He stood on the steps, his face uncertain, after a long time, a foot, sigh: &ldquo;just, just.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He kept shaking his head, then he started to ride the sword and went south. In a moment, he disappeared.</p>
<p>In the ancient temple, there was a sudden silence. The insects that had just been frightened and disappeared by Lvshun also sounded again. The cold moon and the clear wind made the scenery desolate again.</p>
<p>But as Lu Shun disappeared for a long time, the ancient temple seemed to have lost its vitality, and there was still no movement. After another moment, suddenly a sharp roar came from the air, and the red sword suddenly rushed down from the clouds in the sky. It fell into the courtyard of the ancient temple very quickly. After shaking for a few times, Lu Shun appeared.</p>
<p>This time he came and went, but he pretended to be far away, but turned back from afar, hiding in the dark clouds in the sky. It&rsquo;s a pity that Rao is like this, but there is still no one in the ancient temple. Lv Shun finally looks dejected. He sighs for a long time. After a moment&rsquo;s silence, he drives the sword again and flies to the south. After that, he can&rsquo;t be seen again. It seems that this time he really left.</p>
<p>In the ancient temple, peace was restored again, but a moment later, two shadows shook and two figures slowly appeared.</p>
<p>First of all, I walked into the courtyard slowly. The moon was like water, cold and cold. I put his figure on the broken bluestone courtyard slate and pulled out a long and thin shadow.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the devil.</p>
<p>Look up at the moon.</p>
<p>The moon was cold and shining on his face.</p>
<p>Suddenly, he seemed to have some vicissitudes.</p>
<p>Even the little grey monkey, lying on his shoulder, seems to be silent at the moment. Like the master, he looks up at the moon in silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, do you like the moonlight in southern Xinjiang?&rdquo; All of a sudden, there was another slim figure still in the shadow behind him, making a sweet and soft voice, which came into his ear.</p>
<p>The ghost Li slowly takes back the vision, but does not turn back, also does not answer that shadow woman&rsquo;s question. Instead, he asked, &ldquo;why did you kill that Fishman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman who was still hidden in the shadow chuckled and said: &ldquo;those fishmen not only hurt my subordinates, but also my subordinates. I do so. It&rsquo;s also for the sake of your son. &quot;</p>
<p>Guili&rsquo;s face did not change at all. Obviously, he didn&rsquo;t believe these words at all. He said lightly: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard for a long time that&rdquo; Purple awn blade &ldquo;is a nine day divine soldier. Today, it&rsquo;s unfolded in the girl&rsquo;s hands. It&rsquo;s really unpredictable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman chuckled. The voice is soft and sweet. In the bleak night, it suddenly seems to add a few colors and become fresh.</p>
<p>The footsteps slowly sounded, and she came out of the shadow slowly.</p>
<p>However, it is the Golden Vase of he Huan sect, which is called &ldquo;wonderful young master&rdquo;. Only in the moonlight, she is still a yellow dress, soft skirt in the night wind gently swing, there are several strands of fine hair. In the hair between the temples, slightly disordered, but it seems to have a more inexplicable flirtatious feelings.</p>
<p>Deep mountain temple, cold night beauty!</p>
<p>At this moment, her eyes are like water, and her eyebrows are like pictures of spring light. For a while, even the night seems to be gentle.</p>
<p>Grimace turned. Her eyes were on her face.</p>
<p>The Golden Vase son&rsquo;s mouth is still smiling, soft voice way: &ldquo;childe you are pregnant with a strange treasure, it&rsquo;s the immortal treasure that&rdquo; eats the blood bead &ldquo;and&rdquo; breathes the soul &ldquo;, my small purple awn blade. How dare you compare with your soul devouring? &quot;</p>
<p>The red light flashed in the eyes of GUI Li, but there was no change in his face. He said: &ldquo;Miss, are you going south to track down these fish people and other people?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gold bottle son slightly nods, immediately eye wave flows in the eye, way: &ldquo;unexpectedly however this matter has relation with burning incense Valley unexpectedly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost gave her a look. She didn&rsquo;t speak, but she was more and more alert to this woman. Just now, she had raised her head to kill the fish man and the alien clan leader. This way is higher than the way she showed when she besieged the jade sun son of Changsheng hall with herself and Qin Wuyan. I&rsquo;m afraid she didn&rsquo;t do her best on that day.</p>
<p>But this is a high-level business, but it is still the second, and I still have the backhand on that day. But jinpinger killed the fishermen, but it was clear that he intended to blame the burning incense Valley and instigate the relationship between the barbarians and burning incense valley.</p>
<p>This woman has a deep mind and a ruthless means.</p>
<p>The gold bottle son&rsquo;s eyes turned several times on the ghost fierce face, suddenly smiled: &ldquo;the childe this time comes to the south, must also pursue these fishers, don&rsquo;t you know what to find?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the ghost</p>
<p>Jin Ping&rsquo;er listened to his indifference, but he was not angry. Instead, he smiled more softly and said, &ldquo;but now we all know that the burning incense Valley seems to have a secret relationship with these barbarian monsters. What is your plan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think of the girl?&rdquo; the ghost glared</p>
<p>&ldquo;I asked you first,&rdquo; said the Golden Vase with a smile</p>
<p>The ghost Li listens to her cross examination as if she were angry and smiling, frowning, and his heart has turned to countless thoughts: this time, he suddenly finds that the burning incense Valley has secretly colluded with the South barbarians, which is really a sensational event. If spread to the world, I&rsquo;m afraid those righteous people will be shocked to be stunned.</p>
<p>In this situation, the best way is to explore the mysterious burning incense valley. But at present, there seems to be a lot of articles in it. First of all, it doesn&rsquo;t say that the southern barbarians have always been mysterious. The strength of a burning incense Valley alone can&rsquo;t be underestimated. Li Xun, Yan Hong and others who came out of the burning incense Valley in the past, including Lu Shun, the old man just now, have a high level of Taoism.</p>
<p>Jin Ping&rsquo;er slowly walked to ghost Li&rsquo;s body, looked up at him, smiled and said, &ldquo;you want to explore burning incense Valley at night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How, does the girl also have this idea?&rdquo; said the ghost sharp eyes</p>
<p>The Golden Vase smiled slightly, charming and moving. It seemed that there was a beauty coming to her face. Her spirit was so fierce that she could not help shaking her heart.</p>
<p>Only listen to the gold bottle son light and way: &ldquo;I naturally would like to go with the childe this time, only have a thing, also hope the childe promised me is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; said the ghost</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just hope you don&rsquo;t treat me like Qin Wuyan,&rdquo; said Jin pinger with a smile (to be continued. )</p>
