      <p>&ldquo;Is it He&rsquo;s the little tortoise There was an uproar.</p>
<p>Compared with all the people, the most shocking thing here is Xu Baocai. He looks at Bai Xiaochun and feels that his eyes will come out. Just now, he despises Bai Xiaochun and doesn&rsquo;t take the three chapters of spirit and beast seriously. At this moment, Bai Xiaochun should not be taken seriously</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great success of plants and animals Bai Xiaochun here, he just clearly is teasing me!! But it&rsquo;s amazing. He&rsquo;s only been here for a few years Is he a little turtle Xu Baocai took a deep breath and quickly took out a small book to record all this. He secretly congratulated himself for resolving the grudges with the other party, and he was also glad that he had not made his contemptuous words too obvious.</p>
<p>Just when everyone was shocked, Bai Xiaochun walked out of the door and sighed. In fact, he didn&rsquo;t want to show his accomplishments in the ten steles of plants, trees, spirits and animals. After all, Zhou Xinqi&rsquo;s admirers still have inner disciples.</p>
<p>But now he can&rsquo;t help it. He can&rsquo;t help but see the expression of people around him and hear their voice. Bai Xiaochun can&rsquo;t help but feel moved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are all good classmates. If only all of them were like this.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun sighed and walked out of the door. Under the attention of the public, he chose a furnace and sat down.</p>
<p>Elder Xu looked at Bai Xiaochun. He was thoughtful. A smile appeared on the corner of his mouth. Soon he disappeared. He calmed down again and spoke lightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the pocket in front of you, there are ten pieces of herbal medicine, which can be refined ten times. It&rsquo;s ink spirit fragrance!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take the success probability as the assessment basis, and pass twice, the most Reward 5000 contribution points. Go ahead. &quot;</p>
<p>At the moment when elder Xu&rsquo;s words spread out, all the disciples who were waiting for examination were shocked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This time, it&rsquo;s really Mo Lingxiang who is evaluated!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Although the ink spirit fragrance is not the most difficult elixir in the first level, it is also very difficult It&rsquo;s not like a miraculous medicine like ninglingxiang. Many of them have practiced in advance. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hum, the more so, the more you test a person&rsquo;s ability to refine medicine. Don&rsquo;t you see that the four chapters on plants have changed into five. Now the difficulty of miraculous medicine is increasing, and it is estimated that it will be more and more difficult in the future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the four weeks when people began to talk in a low voice, all the people sitting in front of the furnace waiting for examination all looked dignified. Although many of them felt bitter after hearing the smell of ink, they could not bear to be distracted. They opened their pockets and checked the herbs one after another.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun had said something about five thousand congratulations from Xu Baocai before. After hearing elder Xu&rsquo;s words, he felt more moved. There was not much left for him to contribute. In the future, whether he changed prescriptions or bought herbs, he needed to contribute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I can get these 5000 contribution points, I will save a lot of things, and I won&rsquo;t have to worry about earning any more.&rdquo; When Bai Xiaochun thought of this, he opened his pocket in front of him. In addition to ten herbs, there was also a jade slip. When he pinched it in his hand, he saw that it was the prescription of Mo Lingxiang.</p>
<p>Instead of refining the medicine immediately, Bai Xiaochun calmed her Qi and concentrated her mind for a moment and studied the prescription carefully.</p>
<p>His research speed is very slow, which is related to his habit of refining medicine. Even if there is a subtle problem, he needs to completely overcome it before he feels safe.</p>
<p>Such a study is an hour.</p>
<p>In this hour, Du Lingfei and others had already finished checking the plants and plants and began to refine the medicine. Even the quick ones, the first furnace had already refined more than half of them.</p>
<p>Looking at the whole square, except for Bai Xiaochun, others are refining medicine. Only Bai Xiaochun is thinking about it with a jade slip. This strange scene has surprised many of Xu Baocai&rsquo;s disciples.</p>
<p>At this time, the first batch of miraculous medicine came out one after another. The dull roar came out, not to mention Bai Xiaochun. Most of the 18 people who took part in the examination were silent. Bursts of black smoke rose from their furnace, and the first furnace failed.</p>
<p>Only Han Jianye laughs. When the furnace in front of him vibrates, the fragrance of medicine comes out. At the bottom of the stove, a three inch sized piece of ink spirit incense appears.</p>
<p>The outer disciples who were watching around immediately looked at them one by one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first heat is a success</p>
<p>&ldquo;Han Jianye is unique in refining medicine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Han Jianye&rsquo;s face was exhilarated. He took a proud look at the other examiners around him. Especially when he looked at Bai Xiaochun, he found that Bai Xiaochun was still studying the prescription. He did not show disdain in his eyes. He lowered his head and took out a second portion of grass and trees to refine the medicine again.</p>
<p>Du Lingfei and others all have some ugly faces. They bite their teeth and refine them again.</p>
<p>As time goes by, when the second hour is over, the second batch of elixir comes out one after another, and the dull roar comes out again. This time None of them succeeded or failed.</p>
<p>It was at this time that Bai Xiaochun finally put down the jade slips. He had fully understood the prescription of the ink spirit fragrance in his mind. But when everyone thought that he was going to start refining the medicine, they were surprised to find that Bai Xiaochun actually took out a miraculous medicine and began to study it there. He looked serious and focused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is Bai Xiaochun doing? He has studied the prescription for two hours. What is there to study? &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even if it&rsquo;s inspection, it&rsquo;s not so slow&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xu Baocai also opened his eyes and thought it was incredible. Looking at other people, they all started the third furnace.</p>
<p>The third hour came. This time, all the 18 examiners failed again. At the end of the fourth hour and the fifth hour, four people successfully refined Mo Lingxiang, Du Lingfei, Chen Ziang and Zhao Yiduo, all of whom successfully refined the first piece of ink Lingxiang.</p>
<p>With the spread of the aroma, Han Jianye smiles with pride. He is the first person to refine the second piece of ink. Looking around at the moment, he looks more and more proud. He despises Bai Xiaochun more.</p>
<p>At the moment, Bai Xiaochun is studying the fourth kind of vegetation, and even tears a small piece of observation from time to time. Not only do people around him become more surprised, but even elder Xu also looks at him a few times.</p>
<p>Time flies by again, and the sixth hour soon comes. The sixth pot of miraculous medicine, others all failed, only Han Jianye succeeded.</p>
<p>At this moment, all the people around were in an uproar. Even elder Xu nodded slightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This Han Jianye, refined out the third piece, others are still one piece!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the past assessment, the success rate was 20% qualified and 40% Tianjiao. There are still several times behind Han Jianye. As long as it becomes a piece again, it is Tianjiao!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the four weeks when people have been talking about it, Han Jianye showed a strong confidence in his eyes, he murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fourth ink spirit fragrance, I can certainly refine, become the Tianjiao, take the first!&rdquo; He swung his big sleeve, was full of vigor, and opened the seventh furnace.</p>
<p>Du Lingfei&rsquo;s face was livid, and he gritted his teeth fiercely. Together with other people, he opened the seventh furnace.</p>
<p>At the end of the seventh hour, Du Lingfei&rsquo;s eyes glowed with joy. In front of her, there was a smell of medicine in front of her. As the black fog of many people&rsquo;s waste medicine rose, she was the only one who succeeded in the seventh furnace!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Qualified, I can be promoted, but only qualified is not enough!&rdquo; Du Lingfei endured the excitement and took a deep breath, refining again in Han Jianye&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>The eighth hour passed in an instant. This time the roar came out one after another. Everyone, once again All failed.</p>
<p>So far, among the 19 people who participated in the promotion assessment, Han Jianye succeeded three times, Du Lingfei succeeded twice, Chen Ziang and Zhao Yiduo succeeded once, and others Not once.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun, however, is now studying the last herb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This time, the assessment is too difficult&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the outside disciples who were watching around also felt the tension of the atmosphere. In front of almost all the examiners, there were only two materials left. In addition to Du Lingfei and Han Jianye, Chen Ziang and Zhao Yiduo, if the latter two times failed, then this assessment failed.</p>
<p>Compared with the four of them, more than a dozen other people are more worried and bitter, because there is only one time in front of them. If the ninth time fails, there is no need to carry out the tenth time. Elder Xu will not let them waste grass and trees.</p>
<p>In case of failure of the ninth heat, the assessment of Failed!</p>
<p>In the tension and uneasiness of these people, they used all their energy to open the ninth furnace Any link, everyone is very dignified, qualified people want to get better results, no qualified, want to fight.</p>
<p>Only Bai Xiaochun Sitting there with the last herb, he seems to have encountered some problems, frowning and pondering. Here he is Now it has been ignored directly by others.</p>
<p>It seems that the ninth hour passed slowly. In the waiting of almost everyone here, at the end of the ninth hour, a roar came out. It was a disciple who had never succeeded in the first time. He stood up with a pale face and a sad smile, and then he stood up, worshipped elder Xu and left in a gloomy mood.</p>
<p>All around were silent. Gradually, there was a roar. One by one, the disciples got up in silence and left the square. Finally, there were only six people&rsquo;s stoves in the square, still refining medicine.</p>
<p>Not long after, the six people&rsquo;s furnace, again came out of the roar, only one furnace, spread out the fragrance of medicine, it is Zhao Yiduo&rsquo;s furnace.</p>
<p>Zhao Yiduo shook his fist fiercely. He was short of breath, and his eyes were red. At this moment, his inner agitation was to the extreme. He finally completed the requirements of the examination. He succeeded twice and passed the examination!</p>
<p>Some people are happy and others are worried. Among the five who failed, two disciples who have not been successful before laughed miserably and stood up with a sigh and left the square.</p>
<p>Chen Ziang felt that the whole person was stimulated. He was staring at Zhao Yiduo. His heart was bitter and he was short of breath. His eyes were red when he looked at the last herb in front of him.</p>
<p>Du Lingfei frowned and closed his eyes to think. Han Jianye had the least pressure, but he was not willing to be stuck in the 30% probability of patent medicine. He wanted to break through and become Tianjiao.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The last heat!&rdquo; People around them took breath and looked at the scene in the square. At the moment, only five people were left in the square: Han Jianye, Du Lingfei, Zhao Yiduo, Chen Ziang, and Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>The top three are qualified. Chen Ziang has only one chance left. As for Bai Xiaochun They even suspected that Bai Xiaochun had spent nine hours studying prescriptions and plants, even before it was over Do you want to join the party?</p>
<p>With unprecedented seriousness, Du Lingfei four people in the square, one by one, opened the tenth furnace of miraculous medicine refining, in the eyes of all, the tenth hour, slowly passed.</p>
<p>A bang, Zhao Yiduo in front of the furnace, raised the black fog, he sighed, although failed, but after all, has qualified.</p>
<p>But just at the moment of Zhao Yiduo&rsquo;s failure, the incense of medicine appeared in the furnace in front of Chen Ziang. Not only his, Du Lingfei&rsquo;s, but also Han Jianye&rsquo;s also appeared!</p>
<p>The fragrance of the medicine diffused in an instant, and all of them were ecstatic and successful!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I succeeded, four pieces of ink Lingxiang, I was the first one!&rdquo; Han Jianye suddenly stood up, laughter with excitement, reverberating in all directions. Du Lingfei was also relieved. Although he did not achieve Tianjiao, he succeeded three times.</p>
<p>Chen Ziang even had a sense of coming back from the dead, laughing the same way.</p>
<p>At this moment, people around him repressed for an hour, and then broke out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This assessment is too difficult. Under this difficulty, Han Jianye can succeed four times. This person is indeed called Tianjiao!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Du Lingfei three times, Chen Ziang and Zhao Yiduo twice But they all meet the requirements for promotion. If it was not for this increase in difficulty, it is estimated that all three of them would have achieved a success rate of 40%</p>
<p>Everyone was talking about it. Some people, as friends of Du Lingfei and others, cheered on the side. Elder Xu nodded slightly, especially when he looked at Han Jianye. But when he was about to announce the result, Bai Xiaochun suddenly moved.</p>
