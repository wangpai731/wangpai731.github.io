      <p>At once, several people rushed to the challenge arena, helped Fang Chao up, and watched the fairy swords broken into two pieces on the ground. They were all full of anger, and stared at Xueqi, hoping to eat the beautiful woman.</p>
<p>Under the stage, Taoist Cangsong clenched his fists and said coldly, &ldquo;sister Shuiyue, you are really cruel. It&rsquo;s not enough to win, but you have to rely on the magic weapon to produce and destroy other people&rsquo;s immortal swords. What&rsquo;s the reason?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue said coldly and indifferently: &ldquo;Xueqi&rsquo;s cultivation is too shallow, and her Taoism is not deep, so it&rsquo;s not a big deal that she can&rsquo;t control such gods as Tianya.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taoist Cangsong was angry and would attack. Suddenly, a hand was placed on his shoulder, but immortal daoxuan stood up and patted him on the shoulder. Taoist Cangsong looked at him and finally forced his anger down. He snorted heavily in his nose and strode away.</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan looked at the tall figure of Taoist Cangsong, shook his head, smiled bitterly, turned around, was about to speak, but saw master Shuiyue also walked away. At this time, Lu Xueqi has already stepped down from the stage, and comes to Shuiyue. Shuiyue looks at her, smiles and nods. Lu Xueqi also did not speak, slightly gave a gift, then stood behind Shuiyue, followed her to Yangchang.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan stood aside, and then he came back to his mind from the exciting fight just now. Watching Shuiyue and Lu Xueqi go away, he suddenly found that they were so alike, as cold as ice, as if they were carved from a mold.</p>
<p>He was staring at it. Suddenly, he heard Zeng Shushu beside him sigh and said, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe that Tianya and other gods are born!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan said inexplicably, &ldquo;what is the Tianya?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this time, all the disciples of Qingyun in the audience gradually dispersed. Zeng Shushu said hello to the disciples of the same sect, and went away with Zhang Xiaofan, saying, &ldquo;Tianya is the fairy sword you saw Lu Xueqi use just now. I used to read in ten different treasures that Tianya first appeared in the hands of a Sanxian and a dead sweetheart a thousand years ago. It is said that the magic weapon was made by nine days of different iron falling into the earth, and the dead sweetheart occasionally got it in the Arctic ice field and cultivated. In the battle of Zhengmo, the founder of Qingyun sect was the leader of Zhengdao, but he was also famous for his heart withering. Especially, he fought with the evil man heixin old man for three days and nights with the God sword of Tianya. Finally, he severely damaged heixin old man and corrected my heart and soul.</p>
<p>It is said that at that time, only this Tianya divine sword could restrain the evil things from eating blood beads. From then on, the name of &ldquo;Tianya&rdquo; resounded all over the world and became the magic weapon that the practitioners dreamed of. However, I heard that after the death of my dead heart, this Tianya disappeared and unexpectedly fell into the hands of xiaozhufeng. &quot;</p>
<p>Speaking of this, Zeng Shushu shook his head and said: &ldquo;little brother fan, Lu Xueqi has such a miracle, I&rsquo;m afraid we have no hope for this big test.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was not disappointed. Anyway, he never thought about what he could do. He just looked at Zeng Shushu&rsquo;s disappointed appearance and asked, &ldquo;Hey, elder martial brother Zeng, didn&rsquo;t you say to me that you were not very interested in this big test, how could you look disappointed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu blushed and said, &ldquo;but if you can really stand on the stage and hold on to the end, it&rsquo;s also very dignified, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was dumbfounded.</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu looks strange, but he feels embarrassed. He punches him and says with a smile, &ldquo;what are you laughing at?&rdquo; Before he had finished speaking, he laughed.</p>
<p>They went to another arena with a smile and watched another competition.</p>
<p>On this day, in addition to Zhang Xiaofan, seven of dazhufeng&rsquo;s disciples went to war, four wins and three defeats. Song Daren, Tian linger, he Dazhi and Du Bishu all entered the next round. With the lucky Zhang Xiaofan, five of dazhufeng&rsquo;s eight disciples were promoted. This is a rare good result in hundreds of years. Only Tian is not easy to be happy.</p>
<p>　　※※※</p>
<p>The next day.</p>
<p>In the morning, the sun was lazily sprinkled on the sea of clouds. The disciples of Qingyun sect came to the square as the day before, and continued to watch this one-time martial arts test of the seven branches of Qingyun sect.</p>
<p>Everyone at dazhufeng stood under the red list of yesterday, only to see that half of the names on the red list had been removed, and beside Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s name, his opponent today, Chu Yuhong, was also written.</p>
<p>From the morning, Zhang Xiaofan began to feel nervous for some reason. Although he knew that he would come to have a look, he felt nervous involuntarily. His heart beat faster and his mouth was dry. He had no appetite even after having only two breakfast.</p>
<p>At the moment, he is quietly asking song Daren, the elder martial brother standing beside him, &ldquo;elder martial brother, who is Chu Yuhong? Is he powerful?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren frowned, shook his head and said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I haven&rsquo;t heard of it before. It says on the list that he is a disciple of Chaoyang peak, but I don&rsquo;t know how Taoism works.&rdquo; Speaking of this, song Daren took a look at Zhang Xiaofan and saw that he was very nervous. He smiled and said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t be nervous, younger martial brother. It doesn&rsquo;t matter. I was nervous for the first time when I took the big test. It&rsquo;s good to go to the challenge arena.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Zhang Xiaofan</p>
<p>At this time, Du Bishu, who was standing by, came over and said with a smile: &ldquo;Hey, senior brothers, let&rsquo;s make a bet to see how the younger martial brother won this time&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good, good, I bet my junior brother lost!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me too&hellip; By the way, I&rsquo;ll double it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Count me in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren was furious and pointed to the people: &ldquo;what are you doing? Younger martial brother&rsquo;s competition is imminent. Can you still strike him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was so grateful that he called out, &ldquo;elder martial brother&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren: &ldquo;old six.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Du Bishu spits out his tongue: &ldquo;elder martial brother, I was just joking. Please don&rsquo;t tell master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren: &ldquo;no, you&rsquo;ve beaten it. I&rsquo;ll take five of the gambles you just made!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Du Bishu, Zhang Xiaofan: &ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this time, Tian not easy and Su Ru came over, and all the disciples of dazhufeng met them. Tian not easy looked at them and said, &ldquo;you did well yesterday, but today you are in the second round. The rest are basically elite disciples of each vein. You must be careful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; they all said</p>
<p>Su Ru takes a look at Zhang Xiaofan, walks over and says, &ldquo;Xiaofan, today is your first competition. Be careful. Do you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan felt warm and whispered, &ldquo;yes, Shiniang.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru nodded and wanted to say something. All of a sudden, she only listened to the chime of Zhong Ding. The contest was officially started. Tian not easy and Su Ru look at each other, nods and says: &ldquo;you all know the place of the competition. It was written clearly on the red list just now. After the competition starts, your teacher and I will come to see you. Don&rsquo;t let us lose face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All of them responded together. Tian could not easily nod his head. He whispered with Su Ru and walked away. Tian ling&rsquo;er, who came with them, looked around and came to Zhang Xiaofan. Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s heart suddenly jumped.</p>
<p>When he came to him, Tian ling&rsquo;er looked straight at Zhang Xiaofan. Suddenly, he chuckled and turned around and said, &ldquo;look how nervous Xiao Fan is. He&rsquo;s sweating on his forehead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everyone laughed, and song Daren said with a smile: &ldquo;I comforted younger martial brother just now, but it doesn&rsquo;t seem to be useful. You&rsquo;d better go out, younger martial sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian ling&rsquo;er spat and turned to Zhang Xiaofan and said, &ldquo;Xiaofan, I will have a competition later. I can&rsquo;t go to cheer you on. You have to work hard, and be careful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan looked at her beautiful face close to her, blowing like a blue, as if smelling a faint fragrance, could not help but feel a burst of excitement in his heart, nodded heavily, but somehow, he could not even speak.</p>
<p>Tian ling&rsquo;er obviously didn&rsquo;t think much about it. He smiled at Zhang Xiaofan and went to talk with all the senior brothers. After a while, everyone left in twos and threes. Apparently, they went to the challenge arena and cheered for the same family without a competition. But no one thought of joining Zhang Xiaofan. Maybe everyone thought that this was a hopeless person Come on.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan stood at the same place and watched the elder martial brothers go far away. Suddenly, he felt indescribable. He walked slowly to the red list and looked at it carefully again.</p>
<p>He and Chu Yuhong, the disciple of Chaoyang peak, were placed on the farthest &ldquo;earthquake&rdquo; platform for a competition.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan smiled bitterly and walked forward. Along the way, countless Qingyun disciples came and went, talking and laughing. Zhang Xiaofan listened in, mostly discussing the results of yesterday&rsquo;s competition. In yesterday&rsquo;s competition, several popular people were easily recognized as winners. In the meantime, many people talked about that besides Qi Hao, there seems to be another young expert in longshoufeng. Zhang Xiaofan heard a few words from them and guessed that most of them were Lin Jingyu. But more people are talking about Lu Xueqi of xiaozhufeng. This beautiful woman with the divine sword &ldquo;Tianya&rdquo; has a profound and unexpected Taoism, but yesterday, in full view of the public, Sheng Sheng broke his opponent&rsquo;s fairy sword, which seems to make many people very dissatisfied, but it makes more people want to watch her competition, but the popularity has increased or not.</p>
<p>In addition, the long-time missing &ldquo;Tianya&rdquo; is even more remarkable. I don&rsquo;t know how many people want to see the supernatural things in the battle of demons thousands of years ago, even some elders of Qingyun sect are no exception.</p>
<p>As Zhang Xiaofan listened and walked, he could not help but think of Lu Xueqi, the ice beauty of yesterday, shaking his head. Just then, suddenly a cry came from the front: &ldquo;Xiaofan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The voice sounds very familiar. Zhang Xiaofan looks up and smiles at once. Lin Jingyu strides over. Zhang Xiaofan goes up and says with a smile, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t find you all the time. I came here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu pointed to his back and said, &ldquo;today I will have a competition, just on the platform of&rdquo; kan &ldquo;. Naturally, I will come here early to prepare.&rdquo; Then he looked at Zhang Xiaofan and said with a smile, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s your turn today, isn&rsquo;t it on which platform?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m on the&rdquo; shaking &ldquo;platform, and I&rsquo;m about to start. I can&rsquo;t go there to cheer you. You should be careful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu said with a smile, &ldquo;you too, eh, why don&rsquo;t your senior brothers and sisters come to see you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was stunned for a moment and said with a strong smile, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t know that there are few people in my network, and there are many people competing today. Shifu and Shifu went to see the competition between the eldest brother and the elder sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lin took a look at him, sighed and patted him on the shoulder.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan cheered up and said with a smile: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s nothing. Anyway, I just came to see it. It doesn&rsquo;t matter. But you have to refuel. Don&rsquo;t let others say that the people from Caomiao village are not promising. &quot;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu nodded heavily and was about to say something. Suddenly there was a sound of bells and tripods behind him. He looked back and said, &ldquo;my competition is about to start. I won&rsquo;t talk to you. I&rsquo;ll come to see you in a moment if I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan nodded and said, &ldquo;go quickly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu turns around and goes away. Zhang Xiaofan looks at his back and goes far. He reads in his heart, &ldquo;if you can come here in time, I can still support you on the stage, that&rsquo;s strange.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In his heart, he made such a mockery of himself that he slowly walked to the &ldquo;shaking&rdquo; platform. This is the easternmost side of Yunhai square. At a glance, there are only a dozen Qingyun disciples, most of whom are under the gate of Chaoyang peak. Compared with the qiantai of Lu Xueqi in the center, it&rsquo;s quite different.</p>
<p>There was only a chair under the stage. An old man with white beard was sitting there. Zhang Xiaofan looked at him and thought that he was familiar with him. After thinking about it, he remembered that this was the elder who scolded his disciples for being lecherous outside the crowd before Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s competition yesterday morning. He also complained that he shouldn&rsquo;t recruit female disciples. He just didn&rsquo;t know which branch of Qingyun gate he was.</p>
<p>There are eight challenge arenas in the martial arts test of the seven pulse society. Generally, each challenge arena, Qingyun sect, will arrange at least one elder to sit in the town. Otherwise, young disciples will be young and vigorous, and it will be difficult to control if they rise up.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan went to the old man with white beard and bowed down to salute him, saying, &ldquo;Sir, I&rsquo;m Zhang Xiaofan, a disciple of dazhufeng. Today, I&rsquo;m competing on the stage of&rdquo; shock &quot;</p>
<p>The old man with white beard turned his head, glanced at Zhang Xiaofan, and casually said, &ldquo;Oh, here you are. It&rsquo;s about to start. Go on stage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan answered and looked at the stage. There was no one over the stage. It seemed that the disciple of Chaoyang peak, Chu Yuhong, had not come yet. He hesitated for a moment, and finally followed the words of the old man with white beard, and walked up the steps. At the same time, a group of disciples of Chaoyang peak under the platform behind him were whispering, apparently talking about him.</p>
<p>At this time, the early morning sun has risen, and the first ray of sunshine of Tongtian peak quietly falls on him, with a little warmth. Zhang Xiaofan stood on the stage and looked to the eastern sky. There, a rising sun was rising slowly. The red light was soft but not dazzling, reflecting the clouds in the distance.</p>
<p>In Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s heart, suddenly there was a feeling. Five years ago, he was a rural child who didn&rsquo;t understand the world. He never dreamed of the day when he would stand on the Tongtian peak to watch the sunrise. No, he didn&rsquo;t dream, but he didn&rsquo;t know that there would be such a beautiful sunrise in the world.</p>
<p>In a flash, life is like white clouds.</p>
<p>His state of mind, as a 16-year-old boy, now seems to be that of the 60 year old.</p>
<p>He reached out, reached into his arms, and felt the cold fire stick. A month ago, without anyone knowing or noticing, Zhang Xiaofan was surprised to find that he could barely manipulate the black roaring fire stick. At that moment, he could hardly believe his eyes. However, when he repeated it in the dead of night for many times, the staff was indeed moving with his mental drive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drive things&rdquo; is a word like Lei Guaner in the cultivation of Qingyun sect. It is the expression of Taiji Xuanqing cultivation to the fourth level of Yuqing realm. It is also the expression of every new disciple in the days of countless years of cultivation, who repeatedly read, looked forward to, and worked hard. Zhang Xiaofan even thought that he could achieve this realm only in his dream, and could fight in front of his master One breath can make master smile.</p>
<p>But is it possible?</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan tried hard to suppress himself and didn&rsquo;t talk about it to anyone. At the same time, when he tried to drive other objects such as pots and pans in the kitchen with his mind, he didn&rsquo;t move at all, which also hit his self-confidence. How could such a strange situation happen to him?</p>
<p>In the late night, when he climbed up and stared at the fire stick, which seemed to be destined to tangle with him, he could feel the cool air and wander slowly in his body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When!&rdquo; The clear sound of the bell and tripod startled Zhang Xiaofan and woke him up. Turning around, I saw that there were still a dozen disciples of Chaoyang peak under the stage, and the old man with white beard was still sitting there drowsy, but on the opposite side of the stage, I didn&rsquo;t know when a man appeared, about 30 years old, smiling at himself.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan blushed and hurriedly saluted: &ldquo;Zhang Xiaofan, the disciple of dazhufeng, asked elder martial brother Chu for advice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chu Yuhong said with a smile, &ldquo;I dare not. There are talented people in Jiangshan generation. Although younger, younger martial brother Zhang is still standing on the stage before the big test. He has no anxiety or timidity. He is much better than I was. I admire him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan stayed for a while. Nah, he said, &ldquo;to be honest with you, I was in a daze just now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow&rdquo;, there was an uproar under the stage. The dozen disciples of Chaoyang peak all fell down with laughter. Chu Yuhong was stunned for a moment, and finally couldn&rsquo;t help laughing out. Then he felt it was not right. He insisted: &ldquo;younger martial brother Zhang is joking. Er, it&rsquo;s time. I&rsquo;m going to ask younger martial brother for advice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan felt nervous and said slowly, &ldquo;please show mercy to elder martial brother Chu.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chu Yuhong laughs but doesn&rsquo;t answer. He seems to be in his mind. When his right hand shakes, &ldquo;clangs&rdquo; and a light yellow sword is sacrificed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The name of the sword is Shaoyang. Younger martial brother Zhang, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan took a look at the Shaoyang immortal sword. He saw that the yellow light on the sword was pure and gentle. He felt the spirit of the sword when he was far away. It seemed that it was not ordinary. He swallowed a mouthful of saliva in secret, but he felt a little hot on his face, but finally reached into his arms, grasped the stick and took it out.</p>
<p>All the people in the field, Chu Yuhong and more than a dozen disciples of Chaoyang peak under the stage, their eyes fell on the black roaring fire stick.</p>
<p>For a moment there was no sound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha ha ha ha&hellip;&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t know who is the first one to smile and break the peace. After a while, the audience laughed and said, &ldquo;what is that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve said for a long time that all the people in dazhufeng are weird. Don&rsquo;t say that the thin man who used the dice magic weapon yesterday became the laughingstock. I didn&rsquo;t expect that today, there are still people who use the fire stick today. It&rsquo;s really funny! Ha ha ha&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>At the moment, even Chu Yuhong on the stage couldn&rsquo;t bear it. After a few laughs, he fought hard and said, &ldquo;brother Zhang, this is, ha ha, it&rsquo;s yours. Ha ha, I can&rsquo;t control it. Ah, is this your magic weapon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan listened to the people around him and laughed. His face was red and he couldn&rsquo;t say a word. He knew that it was too ugly to use the fire stick, which would make people laugh, but other things couldn&rsquo;t drive him, and there was a little hope in his heart, hoping that it could prove himself, so he finally brought the fire stick out.</p>
<p>However, at the end of the day, the staff brought him scorn and ridicule. The people around laughed loudly. Zhang Xiaofan lowered his head and looked down. The only thing left in the world was the black and ugly fire stick in his hand.</p>
<p>They laughed and laughed loudly, just as their classmates before leaving, even the elder martial sister ling&rsquo;er, who he read deeply, laughed.</p>
<p>He lowered his head and closed his eyes.</p>
<p>Cold feeling as if from the depths of the body called a quiet, slowly wandering in his body.</p>
<p>What is the most lonely time for a person?</p>
<p>Is it facing the indifference of the whole world alone, is it facing all the laughs alone?</p>
<p>Is a person&rsquo;s blood cold or boiling?</p>
<p>He raised his head and looked ahead.</p>
<p>At this time, the sun was shining on his face, and no one could see his expression.</p>
<p>The Shaoyang immortal sword in Chu Yuhong&rsquo;s hand, in the laughter and cheers under the stage, burst out almost the same brilliance as the rising sun at the moment, brilliant and dignified. Along with the introduction of his Dharma formula, Shaoyang immortal sword, like the bright sunlight, came to the right place.</p>
<p>A stream of heat came, but Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s heart was as cold as ice. I don&rsquo;t know why, looking at the light coming from the front, at that moment, he suddenly remembered that morning a long time ago: he spent a thrilling night in the wild with Lin Jingyu, but when he returned to Caomiao village, he saw a sea of blood. In that morning, all his happiness was lost, and he even felt buried in that sea of blood In, desperately struggle, want to find their own relatives but ultimately can not do, pain into the heart.</p>
<p>The heat seemed to burn his skin, but in front of him came a quiet night, beside the green water pool, where a beautiful woman stood by the water, hugging her lover tightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; The 16-year-old groaned, groaned, and felt so much pain that he completely forgot the light coming from his face but bit his lips, and the red blood dripped gently.</p>
<p>It fell on the black, black and green fire staff with red silk like blood.</p>
<p>The next moment, he was engulfed by the brilliant light of the sun.</p>
<p>The audience cheered, and all the disciples of Chaoyang peak were jubilant, only a scream mingled with their laughter seemed so harsh.</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu, who suddenly appeared, ignored a dozen hostile glances and sighed loudly. He felt sorry for the new friend, but he couldn&rsquo;t help according to the rules of the big test. Otherwise, he would rush to the stage with indignation.</p>
<p>Even the old man with white beard sitting by seemed to be shocked by Zeng Shushu and took a look.</p>
<p>On the stage, the brilliant golden light and the rising sun are shining brilliantly. Chu Yuhong is very proud. At this moment, even he feels that his practice has reached a peak that he never had before. However, he will make great progress even if he wins the final victory! After all, after today, we just need to win four more games.</p>
<p>Reading this, he could not help but smile at the corner of his mouth. The light of Shaoyang immortal sword was even brighter. He saw the young man in front of him wrinkling his face painfully in the blazing light, even biting his lips.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, just at the moment, his heart pounded like someone had smashed him in the body with a heavy hammer. At a time when everyone could not see Zhang Xiaofan clearly, Chu Yuhong, the man standing opposite Zhang Xiaofan, saw him raise his head and open his eyes through the brilliant light of his Shaoyang immortal sword.</p>
<p>That pair of blood red eyes full of violent killing!</p>
<p>An invisible and unknown cold quickly spread. Chu Yuhong looked at the black fire stick as if it had survived at this moment. The black air was soaring. The round bead at the top of the stick was made of blue light. It was reflected on Zhang Xiaofan, as if he had completely become another person. All these changes happened in the light of Shaoyang Xianjian. No one saw it except Chu Yuhong.</p>
<p>Chu Yuhong was extremely shocked, but before he could react, the cold breath had been wrapped around him under the light of Shaoyang immortal sword, and he almost immediately felt a whirl of the sky, and his whole body was disgusting; a moment later, the light of the round bead on the burning stick shone on him.</p>
<p>Under the stage, Zeng Shushu nervously looked at Zhang Xiaofan who was surrounded by the light. When he thought of Zhang Xiaofan, he was like a monkey being barbecued (it should be thought of as a pig being barbecued by common sense, but somehow Zeng Shushu had the idea of a monkey in his mind), he almost didn&rsquo;t want to see any more. On the contrary, the disciples of Chaoyang peak were all clapping and cheering.</p>
<p>At this time, all of a sudden, people only heard Chu Yuhong&rsquo;s roar on the stage, and Shaoyang immortal sword rose to the sky, and the light immediately dissipated, showing the figure of Zhang Xiaofan. However, Chu Yuhong seemed to be seriously injured and retreated. A moment later, in the eyes of all the people, his seven orifices were bleeding at the same time. He held out his right hand and pointed at Zhang Xiaofan, as if he wanted to say something, but he could not say anything.</p>
<p>After a while, he swayed a few times, fell to the ground with a thump, fainted and didn&rsquo;t wake up.</p>
<p>On and off the stage, there was silence. Everyone looked at each other and couldn&rsquo;t speak.</p>
