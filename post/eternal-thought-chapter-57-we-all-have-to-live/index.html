      <p>With the help of the fire, you can see a big man standing outside the cave.</p>
<p>This big man is very big, holding a long gun, his eyes are cold, and his body is eight layers of condensate gas. He looks more powerful than Chen Yue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The young Lord has judged correctly. On such a cold and rainy day, you are injured and can&rsquo;t stand the cold. You will surely escape. Chen&rsquo;s company searched hundreds of mountains and found you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Almost at the moment when the big man opened his mouth, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s body suddenly burst out. His eyes showed ferocity. He immediately fought with the big man. The roar echoed. The big man looked arrogant, but he was always alert. He didn&rsquo;t enter the cave. His body immediately retreated.</p>
<p>In the twinkling of an eye, Bai Xiaochun chased out of the cave. In the thunderstorm, in the rain, he fought with the great man who was constantly retreating.</p>
<p>But obviously, the big man didn&rsquo;t attack at all. Bai Xiaochun saw this, and felt a thump in his heart. He knew it was not good. Under his teeth, he would not hesitate to get hurt and fight frantically in the past.</p>
<p>The cold wind blows along the cave, and the fire goes out. Hou Yunfei struggles to stand up, but he squirts blood again. Du Lingfei bites his silver teeth and barely controls the flying sword. He gets up and runs after him. He pinches a finger outside the cave to help Bai Xiaochun fight the great man together.</p>
<p>A moment later, a shrill scream came out in the thunderstorm night. The big man&rsquo;s chest was directly penetrated by a wooden sword. Before his death, the spear in his hand stabbed Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s right leg. Although it did not penetrate, it pierced a small part.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t escape, the little Lord will come soon!&rdquo; The big man stares at Bai Xiaochun, spits blood out of his mouth, his head tilts, and he dies.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun was pale and trembling. In order to kill this man as soon as possible, he had to replace his wounds with wounds. At the moment, there was a sharp pain in his right leg. When he bowed his head, the rain fell on him. The whole person was wet and the blood was red on the ground. Half of his body was cold.</p>
<p>Du Lingfei staggers over and sees Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s right leg. Her tears flow down. She comes near and slowly helps Bai Xiaochun pull out the long gun slowly.</p>
<p>In the middle of the process, as if in tearing flesh and blood bones, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s body trembled, but he did not snort. The words of the other party before his death, as well as the obvious delay, made his heart sink deeply.</p>
<p>He even felt the fluctuation of the wind around him, and he knew that before long, all the Luochen family members who had been chased would appear.</p>
<p>After a while, with Du Lingfei&rsquo;s help, they returned to the cave. Bai Xiaochun took the spear away. In the cave, Bai Xiaochun was short of breath, and his right leg was numb. Fortunately, he did not hurt the bone. At the moment, he was bound up. Although it had an impact, now the life and death crisis is nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go now. The Luochen family will come at any time!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun took a deep breath and stood up.</p>
<p>Look at Hou Yunfei. Now she is dying. After several days of struggling, her injury can not be suppressed. Du Lingfei is haggard. Her meridians have been broken. When she helped Bai Xiaochun before, she was shaking and gritting her teeth. At the moment, she looked up and looked at Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>Under the night, her eyes are very beautiful, there is a special look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Younger martial brother Bai&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about us, you are fast, you are Let&rsquo;s go Du Lingfei spoke in a soft voice. Hou Yunfei on one side also struggled to sit up. He looked at Bai Xiaochun tired and nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be able to get out of here in three days. You shut up&hellip;&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s eyes turned red, and before he finished speaking, he was interrupted by Hou Yunfei.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Younger martial brother Bai, after you escape, send a message to zongmen, and my younger martial sister Du and I may have a trace of life&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun laughs bitterly. He is not a three-year-old boy. How can he believe this lie? He knows very well that when he escapes, when the clan comes, even if it is fast Both Hou Yunfei and Du Lingfei will surely die.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if I die, you can go.&rdquo; Seeing that Bai Xiaochun seems to refuse, Hou Yunfei suddenly smiles.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s heart trembles. Seeing Hou Yunfei&rsquo;s little aura shaking, he seems to break his meridians.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Younger martial brother Bai, are you going or not?&rdquo; Hou Yunfei calmly looks at Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun wants to be sad. He steps back and looks at Hou Yunfei and Du Lingfei. His bitterness is extremely complicated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If There is hope, if And the next life, I hope to have a chance to know you again Younger martial brother Bai Live! &quot; Du Lingfei pulled her arm and was blown by the cold wind. Her hair was floating in front of her. She did not come to the back of her ear. Although she was pale at this moment, her face was more beautiful than ever. She looked at Bai Xiaochun and murmured softly.</p>
<p>When the words of &ldquo;live on&rdquo; came out, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s body suddenly vibrated, as if by a heavy hammer, which made him feel pain in his chest. He was staring at Du Lingfei and Hou Yunfei. He was silent. After a while, he did not know what his thoughts were. He did not say a word. His body suddenly retreated and disappeared in front of the two people and left the cave in the thunderstorm Straight into the air.</p>
<p>Seeing Bai Xiaochun choose to leave, Hou Yunfei&rsquo;s heart becomes loose. Du Lingfei stares silently, and her eyes reveal blessing and farewell. She really hopes You can go back to the time when you saw Bai Xiaochun for the first time. In that case, she can go back to Know Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>There was silence all around, but at this time, suddenly, Hou Yunfei and Du Lingfei suddenly changed their faces when they gazed at Bai Xiaochun in the air outside the cave.</p>
<p>I saw Bai Xiaochun in the air. His cultivation broke out suddenly in this moment. The aura in his body was constantly released. When it spread outward, even the rain was distorted.</p>
<p>Like a burning torch in the night, even the cold rain can&rsquo;t extinguish it. You can feel it clearly from a long distance.</p>
<p>The lightning in the sky and thunder roared past. All the people of the Luochen family who rushed to this place were aware of it.</p>
<p>In particular, Chen Heng&rsquo;s eyes flashed. At this moment, everyone was attracted by Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s body shook, and suddenly galloped toward the distance. As he leaped over the mountain where the cave was located, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s deep voice came from Du Lingfei and Hou Yunfei.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll lead them away. You&rsquo;ll find a chance Let&rsquo;s go</p>
<p>Du Lingfei tears, her heart at the moment turned the waves, Hou Yunfei is all in the body and mind are shaking.</p>
<p>At the same time, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s speed, burst out of full strength, toward the other direction, whistling away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All dead, all dead, Luochen family, I can&rsquo;t destroy your family, but Lingxi clan will come and destroy your whole family!&rdquo; At the same time, Bai Xiaochun made a sad laugh and a crazy voice. At this moment, he rushed to the direction and seemed to be able to escape from the range of thousands of miles. Moreover, he gave people the feeling that all his companions were dead, and he was hysterical. Even if he died, he would rush out to spread information and revenge for his companions.</p>
<p>This scene changes Chen Heng&rsquo;s face. Even if he knows that there may be fraud, Bai Xiaochun is too fast to gamble on the fate of his family.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First concentrate on killing this man. As for his companion, even if he is not dead, he must be seriously injured. After killing this man, go to find him again!&rdquo; Everyone broke out at full speed. During the thunder storm, he chased Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>After a while, Du Lingfei gritted her teeth and wiped away her tears. Her eyes showed a strong determination.</p>
<p>She knew that the only way to save Bai Xiaochun was to rush out of this area and send the news back to the clan.</p>
<p>At the moment, she looked at Hou Yunfei with the same firmness in his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t help me. We are divided into two ways. No matter who is the first to rush out, we will immediately let zongmen come to rescue younger martial brother Bai!&rdquo; Hou Yunfei has decided that even if he dies, as long as he has the last breath, he will rush out and let zongmen save Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>They took a deep breath, rushed out in the rain, separated from the cave, and ran away towards the distance. Their bodies had reached the extreme, but their will, at this moment, seemed to transcend the boundaries of their bodies and became a strong persistence.</p>
<p>Thunder roared and lightning flashed. Bai Xiaochun ran with all his strength at the moment. His right leg had already lost consciousness. At the moment, his eyes were red, and the crisis of death filled his whole body.</p>
<p>He was afraid. He was afraid of death. He felt that death was about to catch up with him and drag himself into the abyss.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t know whether his action was impulsive or not, and he didn&rsquo;t know whether he would regret it. After all, his aim of cultivating immortals was to live forever. He had no answer to these questions.</p>
<p>Even along the way, there was a voice in his heart telling himself Run away alone</p>
<p>He just can&rsquo;t forget the life and death together in this period of time. He can&rsquo;t forget the figure in his mind that Hou Yunfei threatened himself with death and let himself run for his life. He can&rsquo;t forget the more beautiful smile on Du Lingfei&rsquo;s pale face.</p>
<p>Between fear of death and friendship, he chose the latter!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elder martial sister Du, elder martial brother Hou, we all want to live!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun bit his teeth and ran with his life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Luo Chen family, you are so desperate to kill, so come on!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s eyes show fierce, like a wild animal with sharp claws in a desperate situation.</p>
