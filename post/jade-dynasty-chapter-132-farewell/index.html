      <p>Qilidong, an altar of Miao nationality.</p>
<p>The new day, as if even the sun shining on the altar platform, feel as if there is a new flavor. GUI Li and Xiao Bai stood on the platform in front of the altar in the middle of the mountain, looking at the land ravaged by the war.</p>
<p>Among the ruins that can be seen everywhere, Miao people come in and go out. From a high point of view, they are like ants busy for their own homes.</p>
<p>Xiaobai sighed, turned to the ghost standing beside him and said, &ldquo;you can think well, the monsters in the mountains are not so easy to deal with! &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid of death. What else am I afraid of? &quot;</p>
<p>Xiaobai shrugged his shoulders and shook his head with a wry smile. At this moment, there was a strange squeak. They turned their heads and looked, but Xiaohui came running, but the running posture was a little strange.</p>
<p>A moment later, their eyes suddenly fell on the monkey&rsquo;s hands. Xiaohui had one in each hand, carrying a big bag on both sides, which was the big wine bag used by the Miao people to hold wine.</p>
<p>After a long pause, he slowly turned his head and looked at Xiaobai. Xiaobai said with a bitter smile, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t look at me. I don&rsquo;t know. &quot;</p>
<p>Xiaohui quickly ran to the nearest place. Seeing its look, it was quite different from the owner and Xiaobai. Obviously, Xiaohui was excited. He could not close his mouth with a straight smile. He had a faint aroma of wine, which came out from his two big wine bags. The two wine bags were bulging, which seemed to be full of Miao liquor, which was quite different from the small bag left in the wine fight a few days ago.</p>
<p>Yesterday, when GUI Li and Xiao Bai talked with the great wizard carefully, little ash of the monkey was bored in the gloomy altar. The monkey was lively. How could he endure it, he slipped out quietly. At that time, GUI Li was full of thoughts, surprised and happy, but he didn&rsquo;t notice that the ash had slipped away.</p>
<p>Xiaohui unconsciously remembered the fine wine he had drunk that day. He was so addicted that he slipped to qilidong at the foot of the mountain. After the fierce war, the homes of the Miao people were broken. It is a busy time, plus small ash, it seems that it is just a gray haired monkey, how can someone pay attention to it, several times under the search. Taking advantage of the chaos, the monkey found two big bags of liquor in the ruins.</p>
<p>Last night, I didn&rsquo;t know where Xiaohui had hidden these two big bags of wine. Early this morning, I saw that she was about to leave. The monkey then ran out and dragged the two big bags of wine back, apparently planning to have a good taste along the way.</p>
<p>But at the moment, seeing the master&rsquo;s ghostly and Xiaobai&rsquo;s face a little strange, Xiao Hui was puzzled. The monkey opened his eyes and looked at the two men. After a moment, Xiaobai covered his mouth and chuckled, and said to the ghost, &ldquo;forget it, if you promise such a big thing to the Miao people, you can take it Well, take them two bags of wine. It&rsquo;s nothing! &quot;</p>
<p>Before she finished, she began to laugh, shook her head, and turned around slowly, leaving Xiao Hui staring at the monkey&rsquo;s eyes, looking at Xiaobai and GUI Li. She put down a wine bag and grabbed her head with an empty hand, which was quite confused.</p>
<p>Deep in the altar. Tu Magu, the leader of the Miao nationality, sits opposite the great wizard, and there is no one around.</p>
<p>Tu Magu was silent for a long time, and the great wizard did not speak. There was a suffocating atmosphere in the air. Finally. Tu Ma Gu&rsquo;s face changed. It seemed that he could not help saying, &ldquo;great wizard, you are so hurt. Why do you have to go with these two middle earth people? &quot;</p>
<p>The great wizard sighed softly and said, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say that to you just now. &quot;</p>
<p>Tu Ma Gu hated and said, &ldquo;the Li people have robbed our sacred vessels. We have risked our lives to take them back. Why should we ask outsiders for help? &quot;</p>
<p>The great wizard shook his head and said, &ldquo;you are wrong. &quot;</p>
<p>Tu Ma Gu was stunned and said, &ldquo;what? &quot;</p>
<p>The great wizard was silent for a moment and whispered, &ldquo;if Li people really robbed our sacred vessels, I don&rsquo;t have to worry about it. I&rsquo;m afraid that Oh! &quot;</p>
<p>Tu Ma Gu was puzzled and said, &ldquo;wizard, what do you mean by this? &quot;</p>
<p>The great wizard said, &ldquo;do you remember the legend of the beast demon passed down from generation to generation in the Miao people? &quot;</p>
<p>Tu Ma Gu&rsquo;s face changed greatly and he said, &ldquo;is that legend true? &quot;</p>
<p>With a wry smile, the great wizard said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s true. At that time, Linglong&rsquo;s mother sacrificed herself to seal the monster in the town Magic Cave. Later generations will never let the five beast demon sacred vessels return to the town Magic Cave at the same time. But up to now, all the five sacred objects have been lost. I&rsquo;m afraid it is really a sign of the rebirth of the beast demon. &quot;</p>
<p>Tu Ma Gu&rsquo;s face changed. As the head of the Miao nationality, he naturally knew the weight of the legend. But after a long time, he could not help saying, &ldquo;great wizard, under such circumstances, you can&rsquo;t leave here. In case With you there, our people will be at ease. &quot;</p>
<p>The great wizard shook his head in silence and said, &ldquo;my old life is no more than 30 days old.&rdquo;. &quot;</p>
<p>The figure shows Ma Gu&rsquo;s body shaking.</p>
<p>The great wizard sighed, &ldquo;in fact, I don&rsquo;t want to leave. I&rsquo;m afraid I will die in a foreign land.</p>
<p>But now the five ethnic groups in southern Xinjiang are divided, and all the talents are withered. If what I expected is good, I&rsquo;m afraid no one can cope with the crisis. Although he was young, that young man in the Middle Kingdom was very young, but he had a strange skill. The black stick around him was very evil and evil, which was the only thing I had ever seen in my life. But the most important thing is &quot;</p>
<p>He took a meaningful look at TU Ma Gu, lowered his voice and said in a low voice, &ldquo;the most important thing is that the Xuan Huo Jian, which is known as the essence of fire, is in him. &quot;</p>
<p>Tu Magu was shocked and said, &ldquo;what, this thing is not burning incense &quot;</p>
<p>The great wizard showed it with his eyes, and showed his understanding of the meaning. He was silent, but the color of surprise in his eyes increased.</p>
<p>The great wizard said slowly, &ldquo;when he met me for the first time, there was a sign behind me, and the holy fire was more warning. However, the black staff and bone jade of the two animal demon sacred vessels were both uneasy. If it were not for XuanHuo, the supreme sacred object of suppressing the demon, there would be nothing else. I don&rsquo;t know how this holy thing was lost from the incense burning valley. &quot;</p>
<p>Tu Ma Gu is silent.</p>
<p>After a pause, the great wizard continued: &ldquo;later, while I was talking, I deliberately told the origin of xuanhuojian. The two men were really shocked. Especially when it comes to the eight evil XuanHuo array, their faces changed greatly. I think they must have a close relationship with this magic weapon array. &quot;</p>
<p>Tu Ma Gu Long out of breath, obviously these words are he originally definitely did not think of.</p>
<p>The great wizard said faintly, &ldquo;you know, the legend handed down by our Miao people in the past dynasties is that only this xuanhuojian and the eight fierce XuanHuo array can suppress the beast demons. Now, let alone that the XuanHuo Jian is not in our hands, we snatch it from the young man&rsquo;s hand, for fear that no one can drive it. Moreover, the mysterious eight evil XuanHuo array is even more unknown. So, in this situation. That young man is really the only hope of all living beings in southern Xinjiang. Even if I die in a foreign land, I would like to go with him, just before I die. I hope he can save his friend&rsquo;s life. I hope he can help me in the future. &quot;</p>
<p>The figure numb bone lips slightly tremble, the old face wrinkles deeply, unconsciously. A little tear was oozing out. Facing the wizard, he slowly fell down and put his head on the cold ground.</p>
<p>The great wizard laughed, and his face was somewhat desolate. He said, &ldquo;after I leave, you don&rsquo;t have to worry about it. If the young man wants to come, he will send my bones back to his hometown. It&rsquo;s up to you.</p>
<p>&quot;</p>
<p>Tu Ma Gu doesn&rsquo;t look up and whispers. He choked and said, &ldquo;great wizard, don&rsquo;t worry. &quot;</p>
<p>The great wizard said leisurely, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to die. It&rsquo;s nothing. However, if you are in southern Xinjiang, you will face fierce waves in the future. The other four ethnic groups don&rsquo;t know the height of heaven and earth. If you look at our Miao people losing power, they are afraid that they will inevitably fall into the well; among the 100000 mountains, animal demons may revive at any time. Disaster is coming. You should take care of yourself. &quot;</p>
<p>Tugu bit his teeth and agreed.</p>
<p>The great wizard stood up slowly. Looking around, he suddenly said, &ldquo;if the situation is really critical in the future, although the qilidong is the place where we Miao people have lived for generations, we should not abandon it. As long as people are here, there will be hope in the future. &quot;</p>
<p>Tu Ma Gu looks pale again. He said slowly, &ldquo;yes. &quot;</p>
<p>The great wizard sighed and walked out slowly.</p>
<p>When the bent figure, supported by Tu Ma Gu, followed by Gui Li and Xiao Bai, walked down from the altar on the hillside, few people noticed.</p>
<p>However, with the sound of footsteps, the figure of the great wizard who did not appear on the qilidong street for a long time was finally noticed by the Miao people. With a cry of surprise, more and more Miao people left their work and gathered together.</p>
<p>With a smile, the great wizard waved to the Miao people around him, but he didn&rsquo;t stop. He walked to the exit of qilidong.</p>
<p>Finally, the Miao people gradually felt that something was wrong. Among the crowd, some people began to shout in Miao language. Although GUI Li and Xiao Bai didn&rsquo;t understand, they thought they knew what they were shouting.</p>
<p>The face of the great wizard seems to be some desolate. On his face full of vicissitudes, his smile gradually disappears. Instead, it is clearly a kind of sadness.</p>
<p>But he was still silent.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a wave.</p>
<p>Take your time.</p>
<p>Tu Ma Gu also stopped, standing in front of the crowd, silently staring at the rickety back.</p>
<p>Many people were panic stricken, and more people had knelt down to the old man who was walking away.</p>
<p>Walking behind the great wizard, he looked at the old man in silence. He was surprised to find that tears were streaming on his old face.</p>
<p>Finally, I came to the passage to the outside of the valley, and the cry behind it had already resounded through the whole valley.</p>
<p>The old man&rsquo;s body began to tremble slightly. Suddenly, he suddenly turned back and looked at the land, the valley and the sky again</p>
<p>The Miao people in the distance exclaimed, and many of them jumped up from the ground in surprise.</p>
<p>However, the next moment, the great wizard closed his eyes tightly, as if to engrave everything in the land in his heart, frowned and turned again.</p>
<p>There was a sudden silence in the valley.</p>
<p>Countless eyes, as if behind the silent cry!</p>
<p>The muscles on the wizard&rsquo;s face trembled slightly, and slowly stepped out of his feet and disappeared in that passage.</p>
<p>There was silence in the Seven Mile cave.</p>
<p>After a long time, I don&rsquo;t know who was the first to cry. In a moment, the whole valley was filled with sobbing sound.</p>
<p>100000 mountains.</p>
<p>Through the black forest, and then over seven dangerous mountains, is a year-round black air surrounded by the wind howling mountains. There is a big hole in this barren mountain without a tree or grass. The mouth of the cave is three feet high and five feet wide. The wind blows from it all the year round. It is even more mixed with sharp noises. It seems that some angry soul is constantly roaring.</p>
<p>In the middle of the cave, there stands a stone statue, which is the size of a real person. It looks like a beautiful woman standing in silence facing the depths of the magic cave. The cold wind howls all the year round. Never stop blowing on the stone statue, making a low voice, just like the fragile board in the storm.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just. She seems to never shrink back!</p>
<p>The Lich in black is standing in front of this stone statue and gazing silently.</p>
<p>The dragon around him seems to be particularly afraid of this stone statue, and subconsciously keeps away from it. Looking around for a while, he called, let go of his four feet and ran up the mountain. Before long, it disappeared into the black air.</p>
<p>The cold and piercing wind, blowing the Lich&rsquo;s black clothes, in this desolate landscape, the man seems to gradually appear ethereal, with a trace of unreal.</p>
<p>He looked at it for a long time. After a long time, even the Golden Vase began to wonder whether the man in black had become a stone statue.</p>
<p>Fortunately, he escaped from the black forest. At the same time, he accidentally found a killing knife which was deeply inserted into the rock under the cliff and huge rock, which made Jin Ping&rsquo;er guess vaguely that it was possible that the general of guiwangzong had entered here earlier than himself?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that although the killing knife is there, there is no sign of the killing monk. The magic weapon is there. We can imagine the danger. We are afraid that most of the killing monks have been killed. In a hundred thousand mountains, it&rsquo;s really killing every opportunity.</p>
<p>But after the Golden Vase son pondered, he still secretly followed the Lich&rsquo;s footsteps. Along the way, she learned that the Lich had a magic power. He was more careful and did not dare to be careless. He did not dare to approach the monster in black and the Dragon at will. In addition, most of the Lich thought that the pursuer was dead in the black forest. Unexpectedly, he didn&rsquo;t find the gold bottle behind him. In this way, the gold bottle son has been tracking to the town before the magic cave.</p>
<p>At the moment, the Golden Vase is lying behind a hill in the distance, looking at the black figure from a distance. He can&rsquo;t help but wonder whether the man in black wants to stand in front of the stone statue of the woman all his life?</p>
<p>The Lich has been staring at the statue for more than four hours since arriving at the cave.</p>
<p>Just as the Golden Vase was about to close her eyes and fall asleep, the figure of the Lich finally moved. The spirit of jinpinger is greatly improved. Take a look at it.</p>
<p>The Lich in black seemed to have made a decision after a long time of meditation or struggle. He bowed to the stone statue of the woman in silence and bowed respectfully.</p>
<p>Far away, the Golden Vase saw the Lich and said something low to the stone statue, but it was too far away to hear. Then, the Lich&rsquo;s body slowly turned to the depths of the ancient cave.</p>
<p>Jin pinger&rsquo;s brows are frowning, and the mystery is getting bigger and bigger in his heart. Obviously, there is a great secret in that ancient cave. It is likely that the mysterious figure mentioned by shangguance during his conversation with the Lich. But how could there be such a stone statue of a woman standing just in the middle of the entrance to the cave in this remote and poor place?</p>
<p>Seeing the Lich&rsquo;s expression on the stone statue, it is clear that it is closely related to the stone statue. I&rsquo;m afraid there are still unclear past events.</p>
<p>Just as the Golden Vase was watching the Lich disappear in the ancient cave, and intended to lean out and sneak in to have a closer look at the stone statue, suddenly, the Lich&rsquo;s body suddenly stopped.</p>
<p>Jinpinger was surprised. She almost thought that she had exposed her body in a hurry. She couldn&rsquo;t help but feel regret in her heart. When she was in a hurry, she found that the Lich did not look back at her. It didn&rsquo;t seem that she had found her own appearance.</p>
<p>Then she put down her heart and quickly hid her body. Fang once again secretly poked out her head and looked at the direction of the ancient cave.</p>
<p>At this glance, she could not help but straighten her eyes.</p>
<p>Just in front of the woman&rsquo;s stone statue, the entrance of the ancient Zhenmo cave suddenly rises into the air, forming a strong contrast with the surrounding black air and wind. And the Lich also stopped and silently watched the white air.</p>
<p>The white Qi gathered more and more, and gradually condensed into a human shape. From the Golden Vase, he was a tall man with a huge sword in his right hand and a big shield in his left hand. His body is completely composed of white Qi, which is unsteady in the Yin wind, but his body movements and even the expression on his face are completely visible.</p>
<p>Jin pinger was speechless with astonishment. After a long time, she took a breath and whispered to herself, &ldquo;what a spirit! &quot;</p>
<p>She was born in a demon sect, and she knows something about these ghosts: it is said that in ancient times, when people die of old age, only the soul can not be destroyed. At the end of one&rsquo;s life, the soul will be detached, and she will throw herself into the next life, and will continue to reincarnate. However, in the world, there are resentment spirits. They are greedy, angry and crazy. They are afraid, evil and afraid of fear. They are attached to the world, look back on the past, and do not want to die. They are called &ldquo;Yin spirits&rdquo;.</p>
<p>When GUI Li was a little disciple of Qingyun sect, Zhang Xiaofan, together with Lu Xueqi, fell into the dead spirit abyss in the ancient cave of thousand bats in kongsang mountain. At that merciless seaside, they met countless ghosts under the abyss. However, those spirits were mortal souls. They were killed by the blood refining hall and could not die. Ordinary people were killed, but in the eyes of the practitioners, they were not evil spirits. Therefore, Zhang Xiaofan and Lu Xueqi could not succeed in their ways and could still endure for a long time.</p>
<p>The ghost seen by Jin Ping&rsquo;er is by no means ordinary, but the most rare &ldquo;evil spirit&rdquo; in the legend. Most of these souls were high-level figures in their life, but after death, because of some great and deep indignation and infatuation, they even gave up their lives and were willing to guard something and become a desolate wild ghost, wandering in the Yang world.</p>
<p>This kind of evil spirit is very high in its own way. In addition, it has ghost power after death and is even more fierce. Ordinary people who practice truth are not rivals at all. They can be said to be ferocious ghosts.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that people in the cultivation of truth tend to pay more attention to the past life than ordinary people, and few people give up the past life. Therefore, the evil spirit is so rare. When Jin pinger suddenly saw it, she was really shocked.</p>
<p>But in the past, the Lich in black did not seem to show any accident. Facing the evil spirit blocking his way, he just looked up slowly.</p>
<p>The body of the evil spirit is very tall, almost blocking the entrance of the ancient cave. The Lich looked at the evil spirit holding the sword and shield like the God of war, and suddenly sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you finally come out to see me? &ldquo;He said.</p>
<p>The evil spirit looked at the Lich coldly. His white spirit and the black shadow of the Lich were like two extremes that would never compromise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You traitor who has betrayed his mother, how can you dare to say that? &quot;</p>
<p>The Lich&rsquo;s body seemed to tremble for a moment. He was stabbed by such a sentence, and his whole body was in sharp pain.</p>
<p>He looked up at the angry face for a long time, but he remained silent and lowered his head slowly. (to be continued. )</p>
