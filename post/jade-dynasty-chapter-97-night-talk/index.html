      <p>The three of them were silent for a while, or Zeng Shushu was lively and smart. Seeing the embarrassment between Lin Jingyu and FA Xiang, they started with a smile and said, &ldquo;brother Lin, how did you come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although Lin Jingyu and Zeng Shushu are not very familiar, they first get close to each other when they see their classmates in such a strange place. Secondly, he knows that Zeng Shushu and Zhang Xiaofan were good friends at that time. Somehow, he has some good feelings for him. At the moment, he points out: &ldquo;just now I was separated from my senior brothers in the miasma, and rushed out all the way, and fell not far away from here It&rsquo;s good to see that there&rsquo;s a magic weapon flickering here, so I&rsquo;ll come and have a look. &quot;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu smiled and put out his hand to wipe the rain on his face, saying: &ldquo;it seems that we are quite destined. In such a dangerous place, it is better to have more people, right! Senior brother Faxiang? &quot;</p>
<p>FA Xiang smiled and nodded: &ldquo;yes Well, it&rsquo;s stopped raining? &quot;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu and Lin Jingyu are stunned. They look up to the sky. They don&rsquo;t know when. The rain just kept falling. It&rsquo;s getting smaller. Now it&rsquo;s getting brighter. Even the sky seems to be wider.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu breathed deeply, and felt that the air in the forest after the rain was fresh and incomparable, as if it was still sweet and penetrated into his heart.</p>
<p>FA Xiang looked back at the flowers that had been completely closed, and said: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s very strange here. It&rsquo;s not a good kind of strange flowers. You can&rsquo;t stay for a long time. Let&rsquo;s leave here first!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu didn&rsquo;t speak. Zeng Shushu said with a smile: &ldquo;elder martial brother Faxiang is right. Let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said, he turned to look at Lin Jingyu, Lin Jingyu silently nodded.</p>
<p>At present, the three people, after finishing up, have mastered the magic weapon and soared into the air.</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu pondered for a moment in the middle of the air and said to the two of them, &ldquo;brother Faxiang, brother Lin, this forest is huge and amazing, and there are countless poisonous insects, beasts, and all kinds of ferocious things, even though the hearsay of the strange treasure is deep in the forest. What do we do next? &quot;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu said: &ldquo;elder martial brother Zeng, if you don&rsquo;t enter the tiger&rsquo;s den, how can you get a tiger?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu took a look at him, then turned his head and looked at each other. Seeing that the Dharma phase smiled in unison, there was obviously no objection. Then he said with a smile, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s so good. Let&rsquo;s explore the savage and evil land and find out what strange treasure is born.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All three are in a good mood. Activate the magic weapon, turn it into three millirays, and continue to fly to the deep forest.</p>
<p>The night began to fall and the sky was completely dark.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu and other three searched for half a day, but found nothing. The hearsay of the strange treasure didn&rsquo;t even see a shadow. It&rsquo;s all right. I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of monsters and poisonous insects in this strange forest. Some of them are quite strange, sometimes even they are in the air. Flying past a big tree, unexpectedly a dead branch on the big tree suddenly turned into a gray poisonous insect and bit it.</p>
<p>In this connection, although the three men, who have cultivated by themselves, are all outstanding talents in all disciplines, most of them have passed through with surprise or without danger, they can&rsquo;t help but be surprised.</p>
<p>At the moment, it was getting dark. The three discussed and found a big stone in the forest. It was even. The three settled down to rest.</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu carefully walked to one side, focused on the alert, and at the same time, controlled the magic weapon Xuanyuan sword, which set off the glimmer. Carefully watch out, pick and choose, and finally pick some dry branches for good or bad, and prepare to make a fire.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu is looking at it. He can&rsquo;t help but smile. Zeng Shushu is listening. With him to look at, know his mind, can not help but also ha ha laugh out.</p>
<p>In the two thousand years since the establishment of Qingyun sect, Zeng Shushu must be the most careful and careful in picking firewood!</p>
<p>Looking back, Zeng Shushu took out the fire fold from his pocket, but it rained heavily in the daytime, and the wood nearby was a little damp. After a long day, many thick smoke came out, which ignited the fire.</p>
<p>FA Xiang looks around and sees that the forest is dark. He ponders for a moment. He greets Lin Jingyu and Zeng Shushu and signals them to sit closer. Then he takes a deep breath and chants the mantra slowly. The magic weapon &ldquo;samsara bead&rdquo; is slowly sacrificed from his hands. After a while, the soft golden light flickered and extended, forming a six foot circle of golden halo around the periphery, covering the three of them.</p>
<p>In the night, the faces of the three of them are reflected with some light gold under the soft light of reincarnation beads. Lin Jingyu and Zeng Shushu are both from famous families. The skill of FA Xiang is naturally clear. Although Lin Jingyu has a bad heart for him, he is also like Zeng Shushu, showing the color of surprise and admiration.</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu said with a smile: &ldquo;elder martial brother Faxiang is good at magic power, admire, admire!&rdquo;</p>
<p>FA Xiang smiled and said: &ldquo;there are too many poisonous insects here. I&rsquo;m afraid that the light of this small fire is not enough to defend. With this&rdquo; Prajna heart circle &ldquo;, we don&rsquo;t have to worry about ordinary poisons tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, he smiled at the two people lightly, and looked at Lin Jingyu consciously or unconsciously. Lin Jingyu looked at him, lowered his head slowly, and didn&rsquo;t say anything. FA Xiang moved his eyes back slowly, and looked at the small fire in the middle of the three people. The fire reflected in his eyes, and didn&rsquo;t know what he was thinking?</p>
<p>At this time, the atmosphere gradually quieted down, the three people did not speak any more, only heard the deep night and darkness around them, and suddenly there was a wind.</p>
<p>The wind sounds like a sob, like a sad woman crying alone a long time ago, floating gently in the forest, sweeping the treetops and branches.</p>
<p>The whole dark forest, in the dark night, suddenly seemed to have life, opened its mind, let its descendants in its infinite broad mind, free and active singing.</p>
<p>The night was darker, and the wind was blowing through the trees.</p>
<p>The fire swayed.</p>
<p>FA Xiang closed his eyes and meditated. Zeng Shushu seemed tired. He was lying beside the fire with his clothes. He seemed to have slept. Only Lin Jingyu was still sitting on the other side of the fire, not sleepy, with bright eyes, staring at the burning fire.</p>
<p>Slowly, he stretched out his hand, took a dead branch, &ldquo;pa&rdquo; into two pieces, gently into the fire.</p>
<p>The flame slowly devoured the dead branches, and it seemed to be more vigorous. Lin Jingyu suddenly felt something and looked aside, only to see that FA Xiang did not know when to open his eyes and looked at him silently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Younger martial brother Lin.&rdquo; It seems that Zeng Shushu, who is sleeping, has lowered his voice and said in a low voice, &ldquo;why don&rsquo;t you rest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu took back his eyes and looked at the fire in front of him again. After a while, he said lightly, &ldquo;master, didn&rsquo;t you sleep?&rdquo;</p>
<p>FA Xiang said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always been meditating and resting, which has become a habit. It&rsquo;s younger brother Lin. We need more rest. &quot;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu was silent. After a while, he suddenly said, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t slept in these ten years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>FA Xiang frowns. Some strange, said: &ldquo;why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu&rsquo;s eyes reflected the flame burning in front of him, and said slowly: &ldquo;as long as I close my eyes, I will think of the villagers of Caomiao village who died miserably and innocently. I will think of Xiaofan brothers who are now in the evil way. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pa!&rdquo; A crisp sound reverberates gently in the deep night. Lin Jingyu broke the dead branch in his hand again, and then slowly put it into the fire.</p>
<p>It was dark at night, and the forest in the darkness seemed to roar in the silence of the distance.</p>
<p>FA Xiang silently looks at Lin Jingyu, the young man beside the weak fire light. At the moment, his figure seems to be a little lonely but stubborn.</p>
<p>For a while, he took back his eyes and looked into the air in front of him. &ldquo;You still remember Zhang Xiaofan, younger martial brother Zhang?&rdquo; he said suddenly</p>
<p>Lin did not answer, but his eyes were cold and he looked at each other.</p>
<p>There was a slight pain in the eyes of FA Xiang, but his voice was still calm, and he said slowly: &ldquo;in the past ten years, he has entered the ghost King clan of the demon sect, and now he is the vice leader of the ghost King clan. People all over the world know that sooner or later, he will be the next ghost King clan of the ghost King clan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it. He slowly turned his head and met Lin Jingyu&rsquo;s eyes. The corners of his eyes seemed to twitch for a while, but he continued: &ldquo;these ten years. He killed people like a hemp and killed people like a fish. Even the people in the demon sect were not named after the blood master. The justice of the whole world was regarded as a serious problem&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enough!&rdquo; Lin Jingyu suddenly had a drink, clenched his teeth tightly, clenched his fist and saw the green tendons.</p>
<p>FA Xiang looks at him. But still said: &ldquo;if one day, you face him, what do you do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The night is getting cold, as if the whole world is so cold and heartless.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu&rsquo;s handsome face is reflected by the golden light of the fire. He slowly closes his eyes and breathes deeply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is my brother!&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t know for a long time, in the silence, Lin Jingyu suddenly spoke like this, determined, without any hesitation.</p>
<p>FA Xiang looks at him and doesn&rsquo;t speak.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu slowly lowered his head, and his voice sank a little: &ldquo;I know that now he has fallen into the devil&rsquo;s way and can&rsquo;t return his head. When we meet him in the future, we will be sworn enemies&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pa!&rdquo; He broke the third branch, and then slowly put it into the fire, quietly saying: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s just that we fight for life and death, and we will never stand apart. I don&rsquo;t care what you righteous elders think. In my heart, even if the devil does not stand apart, sooner or later, whether he wants to kill me or I want to kill him, I will consider him my brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He smiled a little, with some bitterness and determination, and said lightly: &ldquo;he is the only brother in my life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>No one spoke.</p>
<p>In the old forest, it becomes more and more silent. In the cold wind, it seems that someone is in the treetop, in the distant sky, sighing quietly</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu suddenly opens his eyes, turns over and sits up with his brows locked. He seems to be listening attentively, but he startles both FA Xiang and Lin Jingyu.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu was surprised and said, &ldquo;elder martial brother Zeng, what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu, with a dignified face, said, &ldquo;something is wrong. Listen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both FA Xiang and Lin Jingyu were shocked. They were so absorbed in their conversation that they didn&rsquo;t notice the movement around them at the moment. At the moment, they immediately looked around and listened attentively.</p>
<p>In the forest, except for the wind still whining, it seems that there is still a silence, and there is no movement. But a moment later, they frowned at the same time. In the distance, there was a slight, but dense &ldquo;rustling&rdquo; sound, like a night walk of a hundred insects. Although they could not see it through the dark, the sound seemed to be very far away, but these small sounds, it was a few points creepy!</p>
<p>The faces of the three men were uncertain. Lin Jingyu frowned, &ldquo;what kind of poisonous insect is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu forced a smile and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid the number is not too much!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the three people look at each other, they can see the worries in the eyes of others. In this poisonous and unpredictable death pool, they have been a little wary of the murders here in just one day. Moreover, there are too many strange things here. I don&rsquo;t know what will come out again?</p>
<p>Just as the three of them were on guard, the noise of the forest in front of them was suddenly loud, and a moment later, a sound of angry drinking was mixed with the sound of insects. Lin Jingyu and other three people were shocked. Zeng Shushu first called out: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s senior brother Li Xun of incense Valley!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu looked shocked and said: &ldquo;elder martial brother Li may be in danger. I&rsquo;ll go out to meet you&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said that he was about to move. Suddenly, a hand stretched out beside the ground and pulled him down, but it was FA Xiang. He said quickly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go. It&rsquo;s very dangerous here. You two are in this Prajna heart circle, you can&rsquo;t move lightly. &quot;</p>
<p>Said, also don&rsquo;t wait for Lin Jingyu and Zeng Shushu to oppose or not, once the body floated, the white monk&rsquo;s robe lifted the body to fly in the air, a moment later his figure disappeared into the darkness in front of him.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu and Zeng Shushu were stunned for a while, but only a moment later, the noise in front of them was loud again. They were furious and the insects were loud.</p>
<p>There are several voices of surprise and doubt. It is obvious that FA Xiang has arrived near Li Xun and connected with the unknown monsters.</p>
<p>The night was deep, and the cold night wind in the forest suddenly seemed to rise up. The voice was bleak, and the noise in front of it was louder and louder, but the darkness was like an insurmountable high wall, blocking Zeng Shushu and Lin Jingyu.</p>
<p>Cry like a ghost, howl like a wolf!</p>
<p>In Lin Jingyu and Zeng Shushu, they were gradually depressed. Ready to rush out of the moment, suddenly in front of a sharp roar, the moment the insects died out, the dark deep shadow flash. The two figures come back at the same time. It&rsquo;s Li Xun of FA Xiang and burning incense valley. Their clothes are torn, and Li Xun&rsquo;s body is covered with blood.</p>
<p>They were so fast that within a moment they drifted back into the glittering circle. Lin Jingyu and Zeng Shushu hurry up to meet each other, but they both look tired.</p>
<p>Without waiting for Lin Jingyu&rsquo;s questions, Li Xun&rsquo;s sword eyebrow moved and suddenly shouted, &ldquo;be careful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were surprised again, but they only listened to the darkness of the surrounding forest. Suddenly, the sound of insects was loud. They surrounded them from all directions. They were surrounded in the middle. They didn&rsquo;t know how many strange and horrible eyes were shining, peeping at them in the dark!</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Zeng Shushu opened his eyes and looked around. He asked FA Xiang and Li Xun at the same time.</p>
<p>Li Xun said with cold face: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a lot of giant ants. Be careful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu and Zeng Shushu are stunned. Zeng Shushu wonders, &ldquo;what is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this time, the nearby Dharma phase suddenly whispered: &ldquo;be careful, here comes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they were surprised, they immediately focused on their guard. Under the light of fire and the golden light of reincarnation beads, the deep darkness of the surrounding forest, the rustling sound was loud, and gradually the dark shadows gathered and came from all directions.</p>
<p>When the shadow came to the nearby place, Lin Jingyu and others looked carefully, and took a breath of cool air when they arrived. They saw that the monsters that were constantly crawling out of the darkness around were ant like monsters, but each of these things was the size of a human calf, while the number seemed to be infinite, and the sound of the moment&rsquo;s gritty hair filled the glade.</p>
<p>Raoshi, Zeng Shushu and others are highly cultivated, and their faces are a little white at the moment. However, those giant ants are afraid of the Prajna heart circle arranged by the Dharma phase or the fire burning in the field. Although they are close, they are only half a foot away, and they are not close. But more and more giant ants emerge from the dark, which is not less than a few tens of thousands.</p>
<p>There were black shadows, some white faces on the four of them, and the wind was bleak. It seemed that they were laughing at these stupid people and harassing the ancient peace here.</p>
<p>That distant wind, as if there is a faint flute sound, drifting with the wind.</p>
<p>As soon as Li Xun&rsquo;s face changed, he suddenly raised his voice and shouted, &ldquo;which demon sect devil is playing tricks here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His voice was so strong that even the wind stopped for a moment.</p>
<p>This time, not only Zeng Shushu and Lin Jingyu, but also FA Xiang was surprised. He just went out to meet Li Xun, but also saw a lot of giant ants. He didn&rsquo;t find any demons. He immediately asked, &ldquo;what, these giant ants are the demons of demons?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li Xun snorted and looked around fiercely, saying: &ldquo;yes, at night, I suddenly met a strange man nearby. He immediately turned his face and started using the magic of the demon sect. As for these monsters, he didn&rsquo;t know what evil ways he used, but he could control such fierce things&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>Li Xun&rsquo;s voice didn&rsquo;t fall down. Suddenly someone chuckled in the dark and said, &ldquo;this righteous great Xia has a clear mind, but I remember that you started with me first, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The voice is a male voice. It seems that he is not old, but his voice is so erratic that he can&rsquo;t tell where he is?</p>
<p>Li Xun&rsquo;s face changed. In such an unfavorable situation, he had no fear. He said in a loud voice, &ldquo;since you are a demon of demon sect, I naturally want to get rid of demons and subdue demons. If you are a man, stand up. Let&rsquo;s fight for three hundred rounds alone. What kind of hero are we to use these ignorant beasts?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man suddenly smiled and said lightly, &ldquo;heroes are you righteous heroes. It&rsquo;s not up to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the sound of his voice and the sound of the flute, the giant ant suddenly separated and gave way. A young man came out of the dark slowly, standing outside the golden heart circle of Prajna, smiling and elegant.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the ten thousand poison gate Qin Wuyan!</p>
<p>FA Xiang&rsquo;s face was grim. He looked at him carefully. Suddenly, he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m young, and I can control thousands of poisonous insects. Is it not Mr. Qin Wuyan, the man of Wandu sect, who is called the poisonous childe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Qin Wuyan frowned, turned his eyes and looked at the view phase carefully. Then he said with a smile: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the master of Dharma phase in Tianyin temple. No wonder his Dharma eyes are like torches. I&rsquo;m Qin Wuyan.&rdquo; Speaking of this, he paused and said leisurely: &ldquo;it is said that among the young disciples of the three main sects of Zhengdao, it is generally recognized that master Faxiang of Tianyin temple is the best, with deep wisdom and high virtue. When he saw it today, it was indeed worthy of reputation. Qin Wuyan is polite here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Say, slightly nod, smile on the face.</p>
<p>With a frown on his brow, FA Xiang almost heard a slight hum from Li Xun&rsquo;s mouth, and his heart was full of awe.</p>
<p>Qin Wuyan had a smile on his face, but he was in a hurry. Different from other people, he was born in the world of Warcraft, and entered the inner water where there were countless fierce animals and poisonous insects. Others thought that he was afraid of the way. For him, he was just as happy as suddenly entering the treasure mountain.</p>
<p>The common but unsolicited poisonous things are everywhere now. There are countless strange poisonous insects that he has never heard of before. In the eyes of the expert who uses poison, they are ten times more precious than thousands of gold and silver.</p>
<p>The ten thousand poisons sect has always been unique among the demons. Although the cultivation method comes from the &ldquo;heavenly book&rdquo; with other sects, what they inherited and inherited is the magic cultivation method supplemented by various strange poisons. Therefore, for hundreds of years, the experts in this sect are often experts in poisons.</p>
<p>And to be able to find the strongest and most poisonous poison is immeasurable for the disciples of the ten thousand poisons.</p>
<p>Qin Wuyan is the close disciple of the poison God, the leader of the ten thousand poisons sect. He has a very high talent. He is even a genius in using poison. After entering the inner water, it was a surprise to see the scene here. Many poisons were collected in the past days, and the unique poisonous giant ant in the dead water. Qin Wuyan tried to control the demon flute with the ten thousand poisons gate. Maybe it was the God script of the demon cult that contained the unpredictable creation of heaven and earth. These savage beasts were also successfully controlled by Qin Wuyan in the law gate handed down by the heaven script.</p>
<p>When Qin Wuyan was overjoyed, he suddenly met Li Xun of the burning incense Valley, who fell nearby. When they met each other, they started. Qin Wuyan simply called out the countless &ldquo;dead giant ants&rdquo;. Although Li Xun had a high road, he was surrounded by them, and only had the ability to parry. If he didn&rsquo;t arrive in time, he would suffer a great loss.</p>
<p>But now, the situation, together with four people, such as FA Xiang, Zeng Shushu, Lin Jingyu and Li Xun, is trapped by Qin Wuyan, who is young at this age, but with all his means. (to be continued. )</p>
