      <p>GUI Li was stunned, but I saw the tenderness in Xiaobai&rsquo;s eyes. He was so watery that he reflected his figure and face. He couldn&rsquo;t help but jump in his heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re drunk.&rdquo; When he said this, he couldn&rsquo;t help but have a little sweat on his head.</p>
<p>Xiaobai&rsquo;s body, at this moment, seems to have been completely unable to stand, all the weight is leaning on the ghost. But see her white teeth gently bit a red lip, lazy there is a trace of tender pity, the mouth of a low voice * *, as if hook people&rsquo;s soul general amorous feelings, slowly, her head against the ghostly shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah&hellip;&rdquo; This is a drunk, soft and infinite woman, gently tunnel.</p>
<p>It seems to be because the wine is too strong, she gently turn her head on the shoulder, maybe it is a headache! Just her voice, soft or in the ear, gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are too tired to live! Do you know? Little fool</p>
<p>GUI Li was called by her last three words &ldquo;little fool&rdquo;. However, listening to the words was full of tender meaning. From time to time, a faint fragrance came from the woman, lingering.</p>
<p>The most powerful is that her unique face is so lazy and lazy on the shoulder, the whole body nestled in their own body, people dare not move, can not move.</p>
<p>If this scene was in the Middle Earth, it would have attracted countless rumors. However, in southern Xinjiang, the customs are open. Many Miao people don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s strange. On the contrary, most of them think that this is a couple. Especially Xiaobai&rsquo;s earth shaking drink just now really shakes the Miao Village, and no one says anything about it.</p>
<p>Only some young Miao men who adore Xiaobai are depressed for a time.</p>
<p>At the same time, ghost Li did not know what to do, and at the same time, he thought about the meaning of Xiaobai&rsquo;s words just now. The words &ldquo;living too tired&rdquo; slowly echoed in his mind, at a loss for a moment.</p>
<p>At this time, suddenly heard around the &ldquo;squeak&rdquo; a few calls, it is the voice of small ash. He remembered that Xiao Hui had been playing beside him. The scene of wine drinking just now was so shocking that he forgot Xiao Hui for a moment. Now look around.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, at this sight, he almost choked.</p>
<p>Xiao Hui ran back from the Bank of the river, squatting not far away from Gui Li and Xiao Bai, his three eyes rolling. Big is curious to see the situation in the field.</p>
<p>At the moment, seeing the end of the drinking fight, the people were busy cleaning up. Miao people went to help the drunken soldiers to take care of them. GUI Li was holding Xiaobai, who was half drunk, crying and laughing.</p>
<p>And the scene is more chaotic, the drunkard did not say. Weapons such as long handled spears and rattan armour, including the large wine bags that the Miao people fell on the ground after they were drunk were all over the ground. Among them, there were several liquor bags that were not filled properly, and slowly flowed out from the mouth of the bags, and there was a strong smell of wine in the air.</p>
<p>The monkey is curious. Xiaohui is born with a spirit. His curiosity is ten times stronger than that of ordinary monkeys. He stealthily sneaks up to a drunken Miao soldier on the edge and looks around with his head. Seeing that no one seemed to notice here, he carefully picked up the wine bag on the ground beside the soldier.</p>
<p>The smell of strong liquor suddenly came up. Monkey Xiaohui deeply smelled it, and his three eyes whirled together. It was obvious that he had never touched such things before.</p>
<p>Then he sat on the ground carefully. The monkey turned and looked around warily. Then he slowly put it to his mouth. Take a sip.</p>
<p>Wine into the mouth of the monkey, small ash put down the wine bag, monkey mouth how, how! Suddenly, she was in a state of great joy. She actually liked the taste very much. I can&rsquo;t help but make a squeak.</p>
<p>It was at this time that ghost Li heard the sound and turned around. He saw that even the monkey was drinking wine. After a shock, he was very angry. Xindao is really crazy these days. How come, no matter the fox and the monkey, they all start to drink wine</p>
<p>&ldquo;Xiao Hui, come here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li called out, and Xiao Hui was excited. Seeing the master&rsquo;s stern face, he reached out to grab his head and put down his wine bag and ran to Gui Li.</p>
<p>But it just ran a few steps, suddenly thought of something, turned back to the drunkard, ran to the drunkard, grabbed the small half bag of liquor bag in his hand, and dragged it back on the ground like this.</p>
<p>At this time, many Miao people, who noticed the monkey situation here, burst out laughing one after another.</p>
<p>The Miao people are forthright and forthright, especially the men&rsquo;s good wine. Seeing that the monkeys have common interests, they can&rsquo;t help feeling confidant. If you don&rsquo;t believe it, even the monkeys can&rsquo;t help drinking</p>
<p>For a while, many Miao people were so happy that they threw a lot of banana fruit to Xiaohui. Obviously, they liked Xiaohui and gave it food.</p>
<p>Xiao Hui was also shocked at the beginning. Suddenly, the sky and the earth changed color, and countless foreign bodies fell down on him. He could hardly avoid it. He was furious and squeaked and made a vicious appearance to the Miao people. However, after a moment, I can see that all the fruits are fragrant and beautiful. How can I not like it? I immediately reached out to the ground and picked up some bananas. Then I slowly trotted back to my side. I sat down on the ground and ate the banana skin. And the wine bag in his hand was still in his hand and was brought back.</p>
<p>Ghost Li looked at Xiao Hui, and saw that Xiao Hui was eating with relish. From time to time, he poked out his head and put the wine bag beside his mouth and drank it.</p>
<p>Look at the monkey drink several strong liquor, but the face seems to have no red change, actually the amount of wine is not small. GUI Li opened his mouth and was about to say something, but when he looked back, he was leaning on his shoulder. He suddenly sighed and drew back his words without saying anything.</p>
<p>However, Xiao Hui was smiling. The ghost Li looked at him from time to time. The monkey stretched out his hand, picked up a banana he had picked up from the ground and handed it to Gui Li. It seemed that he was very righteous and wanted to share happiness with GUI Li.</p>
<p>He shook his head slowly and turned away, no longer looking at the monkey.</p>
<p>Xiao Hui shrugged his shoulders and didn&rsquo;t know why the host was not interested in the delicious food. Anyway, he ate happily and didn&rsquo;t care about him. Look around, run out and pick up a few bananas back, put in front of the ground, slowly taste.</p>
<p>This messy scene is what Tu Magu, the leader of the Miao people, has just come out of the altar.</p>
<p>The soldiers in charge of guarding the altar were all drunk and fell to the ground in all directions, and the air was filled with strong liquor fragrance; the Miao people in the distance were watching from three to three levels, and from time to time, some people laughed; as for the two people from the Middle Earth, the men were OK and stood in the same place. However, her face was rather ugly, but the woman seemed to have been drunk. Her face was so red and gorgeous that she leaned on the man. However, they can still stand, which is much better than the drunken Miao soldiers.</p>
<p>Even the strange three eyed monkey they brought was sitting at their feet, eating a mouthful of fruit and a mouthful of liquor. He was cheerful and exuberant.</p>
<p>Tu Magu is not a fool. After looking at the wine bags all over the ground and the expressions of the Miao people around, we can see that it was not the two Chinese natives who used any tricks, but his own people who did not strive for success.</p>
<p>At this time, I saw the patriarch come down. Someone had already run up to him, whispered in his ear, and said the matter briefly.</p>
<p>Looking at this drunkard, Tu Ma Gu was so angry that he thought of these wastes. The whole business of guarding the altar was forgotten. What&rsquo;s more, a dozen or twenty men actually went down drinking with a weak woman. If this thing spreads out, the Miao people will inevitably lose their reputation and be ridiculed to death by the other four ethnic groups in southern Xinjiang.</p>
<p>He made up his mind to clean up the rubbish. After Miao people, Tu Ma Guqiang pretended to be blind to the underground mess and walked towards the ghost.</p>
<p>At this time, GUI Li also saw that Tu Ma Gu came over, and his heart slightly ascended. Although the scene of drinking is not a real sword, but this place drunk Miao people, anyone can see, let the Miao people greatly lose face. Just now when Tu Magu came down from the mountain, the ghost looked far away and saw that his face looked wrong. Obviously it&rsquo;s anger.</p>
<p>Although at the moment, a strong smile came over, but how did GUI Li not know that he was unhappy in his heart and could not help complaining that Xiaobai had caused so much trouble in his heart.</p>
<p>When Tu Ma Gu came near, he made a strong smile and said, &ldquo;uncle, I, my friend, she. She really didn&rsquo;t understand the rules, so she came up with this&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>Tu Ma Gu shook his head and said to him, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t have to say, I know it. It&rsquo;s all under me. These people are useless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he said cautiously, &ldquo;is that great wizard willing to see us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tu Ma Gu took a look at him, and then looked at Xiao Bai, who was leaning on GUI Li&rsquo;s body with his eyes half closed and breathing gently. He said with a bitter smile, &ldquo;you go up! The great wizard has promised to see you</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you very much,&rdquo; he said</p>
<p>Tu Ma Gu said lightly: &ldquo;I am the head of Miao nationality here. You can call me Tu Ma Gu.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although he saw that the old man had great prestige among the Miao people, he did not expect that he was actually the head of the Miao people. He nodded and said, &ldquo;thank you so much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tu Ma Gu shook his head and said, &ldquo;you go up quickly! The great wizard is still waiting for you</p>
<p>She was about to walk to the altar on the hillside, but she was caught by Xiaobai. However, when she saw her soft and boneless body leaning on her body, she could not fall to the ground.</p>
<p>Then he whispered to Xiaobai: &ldquo;Xiaobai, I&rsquo;m going to see the great wizard. Will you stand by yourself and wait for me here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaobai doesn&rsquo;t know whether he can hear clearly in the drunkenness, but he hears the ghostly voice ringing in his ear and doesn&rsquo;t open his eyes. He smiles gently on his face, which is extremely charming, but doesn&rsquo;t speak. He just grabs the hand of GUI Li&rsquo;s clothes, but he is tight again.</p>
<p>After all, this place is a strange place. Xiaobai is so drunk that she can&rsquo;t help but feel uneasy to leave her alone here. He turned his mind and sighed. He reached out and hugged him. He held Xiaobai and walked up the mountain together.</p>
<p>Figure Magu in front of the road, Guili holding Xiaobai walking, Xiaobai&rsquo;s body is still soft and soft, walking is generally light, most of the weight depends on GUI Li&rsquo;s hands. Grimly brow frown, in the heart cannot say the feeling, suddenly, he thought of what, turned to look.</p>
<p>Sure enough, Xiao Hui still didn&rsquo;t move. He sat on the spot eating fruit and drinking spirits. He made squeaks and laughs from time to time.</p>
<p>With a sharp kick on his feet, he kicked up a banana and hit it right on Xiaohui&rsquo;s head, which scared Xiaohui. The monkey turned around fiercely and touched the hit place with his hand.</p>
<p>GUI Li didn&rsquo;t have a good temper and said, &ldquo;go.&rdquo; With that, he helped Xiaobai follow Tu Magu to the altar on the mountain.</p>
<p>Xiao Hui grabs his head, stands up, drops the fruit in his hand and shakes the wine bag at the same time. The soldier had been drinking a lot of wine just now. In addition, the wine bag fell to the ground just now. A lot of wine came out. After being drunk by the monkey for a while, it has already reached the bottom.</p>
<p>Xiaohui threw the wine bag on the ground, and was about to follow the ghost. Suddenly, she suddenly got a meal. After a belch of wine, the monkey&rsquo;s face turned red. It seems that the Miao people&rsquo;s strong liquor is extraordinary after all, and they are also slowly taking the lead at the moment.</p>
<p>However, Xiaohui is a spiritual creature after all, although his face is gradually red. But still act as usual, quickly ran to catch up with the ghost.</p>
<p>Only when they walked up the mountain road behind, the Miao soldiers who had just stood guard just now fell drunk, and there were wine bags all over the ground.</p>
<p>GUI Li helped Xiaobai to walk first. Xiaohui stopped suddenly. He picked up a big wine bag from the ground and raised it to his hand. It made a noise. It seems that there are many more. I can&rsquo;t help but smile.</p>
<p>Under this surprise, Xiaohui was immediately happy, picking up a wine bag in the East and shaking it twice; picking up a wine bag in the west, shaking it twice. Walking and picking up, but the monkey had only two hands. He picked up one and dropped one. However, Xiaohui was greedy and unwilling to give up. He picked up seven or eight wine bags from east to west and put them together. But can&rsquo;t take together, only anxious to send out &ldquo;squeak&rdquo; cry voice.</p>
<p>Just want to look up to the master for help, but this look is startled, only to see the master with the Miao old man has gone far. It&rsquo;s almost to the altar on the mountain. Xiao Hui squeaks and jumps over, grabs his ears and catches his cheek. He is as anxious as an ant on a hot pot. Finally, he grabbed two wine bags and dragged them on the ground behind him. Run for the mountain.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the wine bag made by the Miao people is thick and firm. Otherwise, it would have broken if it was dragged around like this. Looking at the interesting appearance of the monkey, the roar of laughter among the Miao people gathered at the foot of the mountain reverberated in the qilidong valley.</p>
<p>Xiao Hui rushed all the way, and finally caught up with GUI Li and others in front of the altar.</p>
<p>GUI Li turned his head and looked at it. The monkey opened his mouth and breathed heavily. However, he held two wine bags tightly in his hand. He was stunned for a moment, then shook his head and turned his head.</p>
<p>Tu Ma Gu made a gesture to the altar and said, &ldquo;come with me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you very much,&rdquo; he said</p>
<p>With a smile, Tu Ma Gu walked into the Miao people&rsquo;s altar, followed him behind him and went in.</p>
<p>As soon as you enter the altar, a dark feeling comes over, which is quite different from the sunny world outside. I don&rsquo;t know if the great wizard ordered something down. On the way, Tu Ma Gu and GUI Li didn&rsquo;t see other people in the altar.</p>
<p>Xiaobai was drunk and worried. He didn&rsquo;t pay attention to his surroundings. He only dragged two big wine bags behind them. After a while, he belched wine and looked around curiously.</p>
<p>In the dark altar, above the stone walls, there was a faint red color, which seemed to be smeared with blood. And in the corner of the stone wall, there are often animal skulls, ferocious decoration.</p>
<p>Xiao Hui squeaked twice, and seemed to be a little uneasy. He took two quick steps under his feet and followed him closely. However, the wine bag in his hand was tight and did not let go.</p>
<p>There was no obstacle along the way, and they soon reached the deepest part of the altar, outside the stone chamber where the great wizard was.</p>
<p>GUI Li suddenly frowned. Although he was a little nervous at the moment, he was subconsciously agitated by the cold breath of blood sucking beads in his body. It seemed that there was a mysterious and unpredictable force in the stone chamber, which stimulated the soul biting.</p>
<p>Over the head, it&rsquo;s the big wizard inside</p>
<p>GUI Li nodded and followed Tu Ma Gu into the stone chamber. He saw the bent figure with his back to them and sitting in front of the fire.</p>
<p>Tu Ma Gu motioned them to wait for a moment. Then he walked forward and stopped at the place just now, respectfully saying, &ldquo;great wizard, here they are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old voice of the great wizard sounded slowly. Listening to the ghost&rsquo;s ears, he was actually very fluent and authentic Chinese language, and said, &ldquo;please come here! Tumagu, there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with you here. Go ahead! &quot;</p>
<p>Tu Ma Gu answered, turned his head to the ghost and said, &ldquo;then talk to the wizard! I went out first. &quot;</p>
<p>GUI Li nodded to him and said sincerely, &ldquo;patriarch, thank you very much indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tu Ma Gu laughed and said, &ldquo;nothing.&rdquo; Said and looked at the ghost Li arm bend in the small white, in the heart this world actually has the liquor capacity such big woman, is really incredible. Thinking so, I walked out slowly.</p>
<p>After the figure of Tu Ma Gu disappears, GUI Li turns around and looks forward.</p>
<p>The bent figure of the back flickered in the light of the fire, and the darkness of the light was uncertain. There is a vague feeling, full of mystery.</p>
<p>He was hesitating how to open his mouth to entreat, and the voice of the great wizard had already sounded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young man, come here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Listen to the old voice. There was a sense of respect in my heart, and I said, &ldquo;yes.&rdquo; Holding Xiaobai, he slowly walked past. Six feet behind the great wizard, he hesitated for a moment and did not move on. It&rsquo;s about standing where you are.</p>
<p>Xiao Hui followed up with two big wine bags, closely following the ghostly feet, but his three eyes kept looking east and West, looking at the surrounding scene, and finally his eyes fell on the strange stone statue of dog God in front of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down!&rdquo; The old voice of the great wizard was quiet.</p>
<p>GUI Li sat down according to his words, and Xiaobai&rsquo;s body was already unstable at the moment, and seemed to be drunk, which meant to sleep. He unconsciously leaned on GUI Li. Rubbing his head against his shoulder twice, he fell asleep.</p>
<p>As for Xiaohui, it seems that he was also affected by the quiet atmosphere in the stone chamber. He did not dare to breathe in the atmosphere. He sat down quietly beside Xiaobai, put two wine bags beside him, quietly picked up one and put it to his mouth for a drink. The monkey&rsquo;s eyes turned and looked at the great wizard&rsquo;s figure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you come to me for?&rdquo; The great wizard still faced the fire and did not turn around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The great wizard. It&rsquo;s a friend of mine who has lost two souls and seven spirits, and only one remains. Now it has been ten years. Like a dead man. I heard that you, the great wizard, have the magic of resurrection, which is just able to save her. Please, the great wizard, you must and must save her&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>In the end, his voice seemed to tremble.</p>
<p>Ten years of sad waiting, searching, as if all in the heart at this moment.</p>
<p>The great wizard did not speak. Silence, stone chamber into a quiet, only the big wizard in front of the pile of fire, burning, open and extinguish indefinitely.</p>
<p>For a long time, the great wizard broke the silence and said, &ldquo;how did your friend have this disease?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He hesitated for a moment and said slowly, &ldquo;ten years ago, I and The enemy&rsquo;s fighting method is unfathomable. I can&rsquo;t resist it if I cut it down with a magic sword. She, she risked her life, burned her blood essence and melted into her soul and soul, which saved me, but she also became&hellip; &quot; His voice was choked, and after a long pause, he continued: &ldquo;but fortunately, she still has a foreign treasure&rdquo; Huanhuan bell &ldquo;. In a critical moment, she has a soul in her soul and captured it in the bell. Only in this way can there be a ray of vitality. Great wizard, please save her. &quot;</p>
<p>The big wizard&rsquo;s back suddenly seemed to be old again in the light of the fire. He said slowly, &ldquo;the friend you mentioned just now is a member of the demon cult?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just now, he was afraid of the bad reputation of the cult, so he didn&rsquo;t dare to make a special explanation. Unexpectedly, the great wizard heard it and said it directly. At the place of suspicion, the old voice of the great wizard said again: &ldquo;she must be a woman! What&rsquo;s more, the mantra used is the &ldquo;infatuation mantra&rdquo; in the magic cult. Is that right</p>
<p>The old man in the dark altar in the southern frontier was a stranger. He was glad that the greater his ability, the greater the hope of saving Biyao.</p>
<p>No matter what else, he nodded repeatedly and said, &ldquo;the great wizard is really wise, indeed. However, although the world has slandered the demon religion, my friend is really very kind-hearted. Please use your rejuvenating skills to save her once! &quot;</p>
<p>The big wizard&rsquo;s shoulder seemed to move slightly. In the sound of the fire burning, there was a slight sigh, which was a light sad voice, with a faint sad taste.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You decent demons in the middle earth have nothing to do with me, a wild man. You don&rsquo;t have to worry about this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he was about to say something, the great wizard went on to say, &ldquo;I really know a little about the kind of soul returning magic you&rsquo;re talking about. But I&rsquo;m not sure if I can save your friend&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>GUI Li&rsquo;s heart trembled and his eyes were hot. In the past ten years, today, at last, he saw a little hope in the darkness.</p>
<p>However, the voice of the great wizard continued: &ldquo;however, before this, I have a question, you have to answer me first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He nodded his head and said, &ldquo;great wizard, please speak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The great wizard said slowly, &ldquo;who told you that the great wizard in the Miao&rsquo;s altar inherited this kind of soul returning magic?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost Li hears the speech one Zheng, subconsciously turns a head to see to Xiaobai. Xiaobai didn&rsquo;t know when to start. His body was soft and soft, and he had fallen down from his shoulder. He put his head on his fierce thigh. He had a smile on his mouth and was sleeping soundly.</p>
<p>GUI Li was so absorbed in talking with the great wizard that he didn&rsquo;t notice her.</p>
<p>At this time, his eyes were far away. He saw that the monkey&rsquo;s face turned red. It seemed that the two bags of residual spirits were drunk by him.</p>
<p>At the moment, it leans on Xiaobai&rsquo;s body. The monkey head pillows Xiaobai&rsquo;s stomach, spreads out its limbs, and lies on the ground in all directions. Its stomach is bulging and it is sleeping soundly.</p>
<p>GUI Li turned his head and looked at the back of the wizard. He didn&rsquo;t know what to say for a moment. He shook his head and grinned bitterly. (to be continued. )</p>
