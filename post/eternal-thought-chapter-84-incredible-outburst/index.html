      <p>When Bai Xiaochun heard the roar, he was startled. He turned around and saw elder Zhou, who had rushed to kill him. His eyes suddenly widened, and he only felt that he was out of his wits.</p>
<p>In particular, Zhou Chang was ferocious. Although his words didn&rsquo;t mean Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s life, he could feel the sadness of the Phoenix in person. When Bai Xiaochun thought that the Phoenix had almost all the birds in Xiangyun mountain all day, even the Lingwei chicken, he felt creepy.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t help but fantasize in my mind. I replaced the Phoenix with my own. My pupils suddenly enlarged, and the whole person shivered violently. I turned and ran quickly.</p>
<p>Although he is not timid, although he is only afraid of death, but At the moment, he suddenly realized that there are actually more terrible things in the world than death, such as becoming a Phoenix</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elder martial brother, help me, I don&rsquo;t want to be a bird!&rdquo; When Bai Xiaochun thought of it, he screamed bitterly.</p>
<p>On the stage, the leader Zheng Yuandong coughed, pretending not to hear.</p>
<p>Under this strong stimulation, Bai Xiaochun screamed and screamed, and the speed burst out at once. With a bang, he ran straight, and almost appeared a shadow. In the blink of an eye, he caught up with the group of disciples who were the most backward in front. These disciples only felt a gust of wind passing by. When they looked up in a daze, they could only see Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s back from a distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This What speed is this They were all shocked, but then, they saw the old figure of perimeter, whistling past, chasing after Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>In this scene, all the disciples took a breath.</p>
<p>Even those outside disciples who look at the outside of the stone bridge are also open their eyes at the moment, and their eyes are incredible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bai Xiaochun is so fast</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems that the effect of being chased is not so good&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the public outcry, Bai Xiaochun wanted to cry without tears. He was extremely aggrieved. At the moment, he ran like a devil. Soon, he surpassed one disciple after another. All the disciples who were surpassed by him all took breath. They couldn&rsquo;t believe Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s speed. Even one even ran away with his teeth in his disbelief. But he could only watch Bai Xiaochun go further and further 。</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn it, he&rsquo;s like a rat with a tail on it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment, all the disciples inside and outside the stone bridge were shocked by the speed of Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s explosion. Even the leader on the platform and others were stunned. They were very surprised at the speed of Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Er It&rsquo;s still the master Li Qinghou smiles bitterly and says to Zheng Yuandong.</p>
<p>Xu Meixiang and the old man of Qingfeng mountain also looked strange. All the elders around could not help laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This son is naughty This is the only way. &quot; Zheng Yuandong had a dry cough.</p>
<p>At the same time, with Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s gallop, the crowd outside the stone bridge gradually raised a greater outcry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is more than half of the people. If he goes on like this, he will certainly be able to enter the top 100!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, uncle Bai&hellip;&rdquo; And then there&rsquo;s laughter.</p>
<p>At this time, the stone bridge suddenly shook, and a puppet appeared. The puppets&rsquo; eyes flashed, and they immediately roared and rushed to the bridge breaking disciples around.</p>
<p>The front Shangguan Tianyou looks as usual. As soon as his sword is swept, the puppets around him suddenly collapse one by one. The speed is not reduced by a little, and continues to be the first.</p>
<p>Lu Tianlei, Zhou Xinqi and the three or five hidden strength behind him are all very relaxed. They kill puppets all the way and rush out.</p>
<p>These puppets also appeared around Bai Xiaochun. He was in a hurry. Seeing the puppets approaching, he was about to make a move. Suddenly, the wind howled behind him, and the perimeter caught up with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bai Xiaochun, I&rsquo;ve changed my mind. After catching you, I won&rsquo;t let you experience the sadness of the Phoenix in person, but let you experience the misery of other birds on that day!&rdquo; Elder Zhou uttered the voice of Jie Jie. In order to stimulate Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s potential, he really worked hard</p>
<p>When Bai Xiaochun heard this sentence, he felt the whole body&rsquo;s blood burst into his mind, and his eyes were blackened. Some did not respond. When he realized the meaning of this sentence, he thought of the miserable birds that were attacked, the howling of the spirit tailed chickens, and finally the strong body of the male Phoenix He gave out the most miserable and shrill scream of his life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help, I don&rsquo;t want to be attacked&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment, his fear even exceeded that when he was chased by the Luochen family. He was so big that he had never been so stimulated. In the scream, his whole body trembled, and suddenly a silver light appeared. This light covered his whole body, making the whole person directly become a silver man.</p>
<p>His speed seems to break through a certain limit at this moment. At the moment when the perimeter elder grabs him, he bursts out like a wild boar.</p>
<p>Boom! Boom!</p>
<p>This speed is too fast. As soon as countless puppets get close, they are directly hit by Bai Xiaochun. They run all the way. Countless puppets are hit and fly, and the whole person turns into a long line and gallops away.</p>
<p>From a distance, we can&rsquo;t see his figure. We can only see countless puppets flying out.</p>
<p>This speed is too much faster than the first four hundred, the first three hundred, the first two hundred until Top 100!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too fast!</p>
<p>All the way, the countless disciples who were surpassed by him all stood in awe and looked at Bai Xiaochun, who was like a Tyrannosaurus Rex. Bai Xiaochun screamed and ran, and his eyes were red. He swore that he would never let elder Zhou catch him.</p>
<p>At the moment, he had forgotten that this was a trial. He had no place in front of him. He had only one idea in his mind, running and running Get out of this bridge!</p>
<p>Even some of his disciples were in front of him. He felt that he was in the way. He grabbed them and threw them aside. The whole person ran away and roared all the way.</p>
<p>Some of the disciples outside the stone bridge stood at the top of the mountain and looked far away. Seeing this behind the scenes, they took a breath and showed shock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He He&rsquo;s still a man</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is this man? This is a wild boar Tyrannosaurus!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhou looked at the statue in front of him. He didn&rsquo;t want to dodge the statue. He just took a breath and felt that he had just Is it too exciting.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s speed seems to have no limit, which is too fast to describe. However, he is still accelerating. When the sound of breaking the sky is shocking, there is no puppet in front of him, but there is a big net. These nets are illusory and block people&rsquo;s progress.</p>
<p>Just in front of Bai Xiaochun, as soon as these big nets appeared, he immediately knocked out a big hole. When the sound of banging reverberated, he couldn&rsquo;t stop him.</p>
<p>It seems that under this extreme speed, his body has become the most sharp weapon!</p>
<p>Then, the ground rose and fell again, just like a swamp, and sometimes whirlpool appeared. As long as it was covered by the whirlpool, it was very difficult to rush out. It was here that many people were limited in speed.</p>
<p>But Bai Xiaochun He just noticed these things. His body swished and ran by. Even if there were vortices around him, he couldn&rsquo;t reduce his speed any more and carry those vortices forward.</p>
<p>Soon, he passed the top 80, the top 50, the top 30, until he reached the top 10</p>
<p>In this scene, the elder Zhou took a deep breath, not to mention the watching disciples outside. At this moment, almost everyone&rsquo;s eyes were focused on Bai Xiaochun. As for Shangguan Tianyou and others, no disciple went to see it.</p>
<p>In front of Bai Xiaochun, there is a bald young man with a cold look in his eyes. He has hidden his fighting power for many years. He does not contact with outsiders. Today, he is full of energy to let the so-called three Tianjiao understand what there is a mountain outside the mountain.</p>
<p>His whole body is shining, and there are three beads flying rapidly around him. All the way, there are more than ten whirlpools outside his body. Under his explosion, although these eddies are not small, he knows that if he rushes out of this area, the whirlpool will disappear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The stronger you are, the more whirlpools there will be when you enter here. I don&rsquo;t know how those people in front of you are. I have more than ten whirlpools here, which is amazing.&rdquo; When the bareheaded disciple was talking to himself, he suddenly heard the voice of breaking the sky behind him. He was stunned for a moment, thinking that he had heard something wrong. How could there be such a sound here</p>
<p>But before he looked back, he felt that the wind was blowing behind him, and then he saw a figure, rushing out from his side, surrounded by hundreds of whirlpools!</p>
<p>The bareheaded youth almost glared out of his eyes. He was shocked to see the figure surrounded by hundreds of whirlpools, but the speed was not slow at all. He felt that he was wrong. He rubbed his eyes vigorously and went to see it again. When he went to see it, the other side was far away, leaving only his back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; The bald youth lost his voice.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun shivered, screamed out, hundreds of whirlpools outside his body. After he rushed out of this area, he immediately disappeared. His speed was faster, and he ran directly. He surpassed several people all the way. These were the disciples who entered the top ten. Before the war, they had their own nature and hidden their strength. Now they want to make a big splash. But now, when we see Bai Xiaochun, we can see them The incredible monsters were shocked.</p>
<p>Zhou Xinqi is biting her silver teeth. The area she is in is different. There is infinite pressure around her. It seems that she is going to solidify here, which makes her speed slow down.</p>
<p>But just as she was about to rush out of this area, suddenly, a click came from behind her. Zhou Xinqi was stunned. In the moment of looking back, her eyes suddenly contracted, revealing that she couldn&rsquo;t believe it.</p>
<p>With a bang, Bai Xiaochun rushes directly past her. Because of the speed, the impact all the way. Actually, after touching his body, the solidification here sends out the sound of clicking, and there are cracks emerging from the void. Unexpectedly Smashed by him!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bai Xiaochun?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No way!&rdquo; Zhou Xinqi opened her eyes and felt the solidification around her collapsed after Bai Xiaochun Chong. She looked at Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s back in front of her. The whole person was shocked by the thunder.</p>
