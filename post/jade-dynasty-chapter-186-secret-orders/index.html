      <p>In a blink of an eye, monkey Xiaohui has been back on the Dazhu peak for several days. During this period, it seems that he has been away from Dazhu peak for almost ten years. The monkey is still so familiar with the plants and plants here. All day, Xiao Hui and rhubarb are playing and running around. It seems that in the past few days, it seems that Xiaohui and rhubarb have become more and more lively.</p>
<p>The barking of dogs and the shrill shouts and laughter of monkeys always reverberate on the bamboo peak, which makes them more angry.</p>
<p>In the morning, the disciples of dazhufeng who came out of their bedrooms in twos and threes looked at a monkey and a dog that had been playing and running in the outer space of Shoujing hall, and they all couldn&rsquo;t help smiling.</p>
<p>He Dazhi smiles and turns back to all humanity: &ldquo;since the little younger martial sister got married, we haven&rsquo;t been so busy for a long time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All of them nodded their heads in succession, quite sighing. At this moment, they suddenly heard someone cough in Shoujing hall. The voice was loud and dignified. They were surprised. They saw that Tian was not easy to stand there. He quickly saluted and paid a visit to the master.</p>
<p>Tian is not easy to wave, is to send the public, and then his eyes were attracted to the rhubarb and small ash in the past, looked for a while, hummed, and said: &ldquo;two ignorant animals, early in the morning, like crazy like shouting, sincerely do not let people sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The disciples were stunned for a moment, but they didn&rsquo;t dare to say more. Tian Bu Yi swears a few more words to the effect that he has kept this stupid dog for so many years in vain, but in the end it is still so useless. He has a hot fight with a stupid monkey. Everyone is amused, but he dare not laugh.</p>
<p>But after a while, rhubarb, who had been playing and playing in the distance, suddenly barked at Shoujing Tangtian</p>
<p>&ldquo;Woof, woof, woof, woof, woof, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo.</p>
<p>At the same time, all the disciples thought to themselves, did rhubarb really have some Taoism. Otherwise, after such a long distance, even if the dog&rsquo;s ears are smart, I&rsquo;m afraid that I won&rsquo;t listen carefully, but if it&rsquo;s an old dog with good morals. Naturally, it&rsquo;s another matter.</p>
<p>People are speculating about the darkness in their hearts, but Tian Buyi is attacked by the sudden rhubarb, and his face is red with anger. He says angrily, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the opposite. Now even the dog dares to jump out and shout.</p>
<p>Old six</p>
<p>Du Bishu, standing beside the crowd, was excited. Startled, he quickly stood out and said, &ldquo;master, I&rsquo;m here. What can I do for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi seemed to be in a rage. He pointed to the barking rhubarb and small ash in the distance, and said angrily, &ldquo;this afternoon, you will kill that stupid dog for me, and stew a pot of dog meat to eat!&rdquo; Finish saying, hate to turn around, entered the guard quiet hall.</p>
<p>Du Bishu stays where he is. &ldquo;What?&rdquo; he said? Master, this &quot;</p>
<p>After a moment, everyone behind Du Bishu burst out laughing. Song Daren and others almost lost their breath. Du Bishu was anxious and angry, and said, &ldquo;what are you laughing at? This is what master ordered. What can I do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren came forward. Put away the smile, although the eyes are still full of smile, but the face is correct, make a serious look. He patted Du Bishu on the shoulder and said, &ldquo;younger martial brother, this is the great responsibility entrusted to you by the master. You must complete it well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Du Bishu burst into tears and said in a hurry, &ldquo;who are you cheating on? Who don&rsquo;t know Master&rsquo;s favorite in the past is rhubarb. Don&rsquo;t say to kill it, we tore off a piece of dog&rsquo;s hair, and master didn&rsquo;t give us a good look. Now this, this, this, if I really take the master&rsquo;s will and turn back to regret it, will I still live? &quot;</p>
<p>Song Daren laughed, turned his head and left. Wu Dayi, the second disciple next to him, nodded to Du Bishu and said, &ldquo;Laoliu, you are really a clever person. You know the true meaning of master. If so, you will not listen to master&rsquo;s will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next to him, he Dazhi looked up at the sky and walked away slowly. However, he didn&rsquo;t know whether or not he said, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s said that the most annoying thing about Shifu is that we disciples disobey the teacher&rsquo;s orders. Once the master knows that Laoliu dares to be a master, it&rsquo;s not in his ear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughs with the wind, but people go far away. Du Bishu is like an ant on a hot pot. When he looks back, he sees that everyone has already gone to the kitchen. He can&rsquo;t help but shout at the back of the elder martial brothers: &ldquo;you ungrateful guys, sooner or later you will have retribution!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His voice passed, and I don&rsquo;t know if song Daren and others heard him. He only saw song Daren&rsquo;s head not returning from a distance. He just stretched out his right hand and waved it in the air. It seemed that they were laughing again</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stupid dog, stupid dog, dead dog&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Woof, woof, woof!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, you dare to shout at me Du Bishu clenched his teeth and cursed the rhubarb tied to the tree stump, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s you who are so troublesome that my master has sent such a ghost job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Near noon, Du Bishu caught the galloping Rhubarb in the eyes of his senior brothers. He tied him to the stump at the door of the kitchen and hung the ash on the branch with his tail. It seemed that he didn&rsquo;t understand what Du Bishu was going to do. He swayed back and forth on the tree and watched people and dogs fighting under the tree.</p>
<p>As for rhubarb, it is obvious that at the moment, Du Bishu has no good feelings. His dog has a vicious face and barks at him.</p>
<p>Du Bishu scolded rhubarb incessantly, but he did not dare to kill rhubarb stewed dog meat as tianbuyi said. It&rsquo;s just that his master has a strange temper. He can&rsquo;t be sure. When he comes out to see rhubarb here, he may be angry with him. Think of these, Du Bishu heart really worried, do not know what to do.</p>
<p>Obviously, rhubarb was not satisfied with being tied to the stump. The dog&rsquo;s mouth was wide open, showing sharp fangs, and growled at Du Bishu. Du Bishu was upset. He glared at rhubarb, shook his head, and said to himself, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s all. Anyway, it&rsquo;s my bad luck. I&rsquo;d better cook first. I hope master will be in a better mood. &quot;</p>
<p>With that, he turned back to the kitchen, frowning and no longer dealing with rhubarb. When he went into the kitchen, the barking of rhubarb was still coming, but it was probably a dog barking alone, which was not very meaningful. It soon became quiet.</p>
<p>In order to win the favor of Tian, Du Bishu made this meal with all his heart and soul.</p>
<p>I heard several yelling of rhubarb outside the kitchen, and then it went down again. Then it seemed that it was a low &ldquo;Wuwu&rdquo; voice. Du Bishu didn&rsquo;t pay attention to it. I&rsquo;m so obsessed with cooking. Anyway, all the senior brothers and sisters will not come here at the moment. He is very happy.</p>
<p>After finishing a good table of dishes, Du Bishu was relieved and took a towel to wipe his sweat and walked out of the kitchen. Unexpectedly, he just came out and was stunned. He saw a rope above the stump, but rhubarb and Xiaohui had disappeared. Du Bishu was very anxious. He looked around, but there was no sign of the monkey yellow dog. He thought that the elder martial brother was joking with me at this time?</p>
<p>At the moment, he ran to the bedroom where all the disciples lived and inquired about the past one by one. Unexpectedly, everyone knew nothing about it. Some people even made fun of him. Just Du Bishu at the moment where there is any joking mind. Under the head hair stuffy, round and round. At this time, suddenly a loud dog barked in the distance. Everyone was surprised. Du Bishu was the first to rush out and identify it carefully. However, it came from Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s room at that time.</p>
<p>Du Bishu rushed to the room. Other disciples of dazhufeng rushed to the room. When he came in, he saw rhubarb standing in the courtyard. He barked at the sky, but the ash disappeared.</p>
<p>People looked up at the sky, but saw the sky high, blue infinite. There&rsquo;s nothing unusual about it. Song Daren and others search in a hurry, but they look for all the rooms, but they don&rsquo;t see the shadow of Xiaohui. As if to come mysterious, Xiaohui this monkey, once again mysteriously disappeared.</p>
<p>Somehow, in the bark of rhubarb. All of them were lost.</p>
<p>At noon that day, when Du Bishu ushered in lunch in a nervous mood, Su Ru was the only one who appeared in front of all the disciples. People are surprised, Du Bishu is a mixture of surprise and joy, but the surface is still concerned, prepared to ask: &ldquo;Shiniang, why is not the master?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru gave him a white look and didn&rsquo;t care about him. She just looked back at the direction of Shoujing hall. There was a strange look on her face. After a while, she said, &ldquo;your master, he has some thoughts. He is not in a good mood. I don&rsquo;t want to eat today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The crowd was stunned, but seeing Su Ru&rsquo;s face, they did not dare to ask.</p>
<p>On Dazhu peak, it seems that from then on, it seems that nothing happened except the occasional barking of rhubarb to the sky.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>A figure floated down from the depth of Qingyun Mountain range. It was light, mysterious and ethereal, like a legend about the spirits of Zhongshan. But this figure swept to the foot of Qingyun Mountain, and suddenly it was in shape. The original rapid speed made a low and low sound in the air, and stopped abruptly. The sound of &ldquo;sand&rdquo; in the grass and trees under the foot was blown forward by the wind.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just fierce.</p>
<p>No one knows that Gui Li came out of Qingyun Mountain, but on his shoulder, Xiao Hui once again lies on his shoulder and meets his host again after a long separation. Xiao Hui is obviously very happy. His long tail is curled up and his end is still wrapped around his arm. In particular, I don&rsquo;t know when, the big wine bag on Xiaohui&rsquo;s body is bulging again, and the fragrance of wine is overflowing. Xiaohui is even more happy about this. He hugs the big bag and loves it. Instead of just pulling out the bag and having a drink, he looks satisfied.</p>
<p>However, GUI Li is obviously not the same as Xiao Hui. At the moment, his face is light, and his eyes look around him. He can see the dense forest around him. There is only a faint birdsong in the distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come out,&rdquo; he said with a sneer</p>
<p>No one answered, and he didn&rsquo;t say anything more. He just slowly turned around and stood quietly in front of some place. After a while, someone suddenly sighed: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s only a few days. I don&rsquo;t want you to be so diligent in your conduct. It&rsquo;s really amazing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a flash, a man in black came out of the deep woods. It was Mr. ghost.</p>
<p>This man, as if he had always been so mysterious, always appeared in unexpected places.</p>
<p>He looked at him with light eyes. Although he didn&rsquo;t show his disgust, he didn&rsquo;t like him very much. He said, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter with you waiting for me here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. GUI&rsquo;s eyes wandered. First, he looked at the small ash on his shoulder, especially at the third eye on Xiaohui&rsquo;s forehead. Then he looked at GUI Li and said, &ldquo;why, vice Lord, don&rsquo;t you want to meet me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He snorted and did not speak.</p>
<p>Mr. ghost nodded and said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s up to you, but I don&rsquo;t have a word this time, but the Lord ghost king sent me a letter a few days ago and asked me to tell you something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ghost Li eyebrow a wrinkling, way: &ldquo;what matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. GUI said: &ldquo;the Lord ghost king was very concerned when he heard that you were injured in front of the magic moon cave in Qingyun Mountain. It is clear that the people in the Central Plains must find you and send a message for him. If you find the deputy leader, if he is injured, he can return to the wilderness and cultivate himself. If he is lucky that the vice leader is not in a big way, there is one thing that needs to be bothered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was silent for a moment and said, &ldquo;say it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Behind the black veil, Mr. ghost seemed to have a faint smile and a deep laugh. He said, &ldquo;the Lord of the ghost king has already known that the beast God has been defeated and fled in this Qingyun war. On that day, this Liao killed countless members of our holy religion. He was the enemy of our holy religion. Now it is a rare opportunity to kill this Liao. He must have fled to the southern Xinjiang he was familiar with, and only the vice patriarch was familiar with southern Xinjiang, because he hoped that the vice patriarch would pursue him in southern Xinjiang, which is a great event for our holy religion. &quot;</p>
<p>He was silent for a moment, nodded and said, &ldquo;OK, I&rsquo;ll go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost nodded slightly, but at the moment, he suddenly stepped forward a few steps, came to Gui Li, lowered his voice, and said, &ldquo;but this trip, the Lord specially told me in private that I must tell you that it is important to hunt down the beast God, but there is one more thing that is most important.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; he said</p>
<p>Mr. ghost&rsquo;s eyes twinkled and said in a low voice: &ldquo;the Lord told me that there was a vicious beast eating gluttonous food beside the beast God. In any case, even if the animal God escaped, but this evil beast Taotie must be captured alive and brought back to the wild. It&rsquo;s a very important matter. Remember, vice patriarch! &quot;</p>
<p>GUI Li frowned and looked at Mr. GUI deeply. He said, &ldquo;what does the master master do for Taotie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost stood up straight, tone returned to normal, light way: &ldquo;this, is not what I can know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a long time, the ghost suddenly turned around and didn&rsquo;t look back. His body shape was like lightning. In an instant, he swept out and disappeared in a flash. Only Mr. ghost stood in his place, looking at the direction of the ghost&rsquo;s far away, and suddenly said to himself:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s strange why he has been so refined in a short period of time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On that day, who was sacred to save his group of people in black?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whispering, drifting with the wind, quietly echoing in the dense forest, and finally disappeared. (to be continued. )</p>
