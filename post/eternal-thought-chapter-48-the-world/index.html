      <p>One day later, when the first spirit stone in the boat was exhausted, Feng Yan withdrew his sails and the three fell on the top of a mountain. It was dusk. The sun was setting in the distance, and the earth was getting dark.</p>
<p>At the foot of the mountain, the sound of birds and beasts was heard from time to time, and there was a lot of moisture around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After this forest, we&rsquo;re resting. What do you think?&rdquo; Feng Yan spoke faintly and looked at Du Lingfei and Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s getting dark. Maybe there are some fierce animals in the jungle. We&rsquo;d better fly over with sails.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rest, rest yourself. It&rsquo;s just a jungle.&rdquo; Du Lingfei snorted coldly. She couldn&rsquo;t stand Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s fear of death. Her body shook and rushed out first.</p>
<p>In the depth of Feng Yan&rsquo;s eyes, there was contempt, but on the surface, he laughed at Bai Xiaochun and ran down the mountain.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun frowns tightly. Seeing that they are like this, he sighs and is more alert. With the two of them, they go down the mountain and rush into the jungle.</p>
<p>The jungle is more humid, and sometimes you can see some marshes. From time to time, there are all kinds of birds and beasts. However, all three are condensing gas friars. Their bodies are flexible and their speed is not slow. They are constantly shuttling through the jungle and gradually move towards the deep.</p>
<p>As time went by, the sky gradually darkened. When the moon was high, the three had already gone half way. On the way, they did not meet any fierce animals. It was very smooth. Seeing Bai Xiaochun at the back, as if there was a little movement, would jump up. Du Lingfei despised him even more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be careful!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun suddenly opened her mouth, and her feet stopped, and her expression showed uneasiness.</p>
<p>Du Lingfei sneered and was about to sneer.</p>
<p>But at this time, suddenly, there were gusts of wind blowing around, in the wind with a fishy smell, Du Lingfei&rsquo;s face changed, when he looked up, he immediately saw countless pairs of eyes in the distant jungle.</p>
<p>Those eyes are red one by one. Almost at the moment of seeing these eyes, the sound of flapping wings suddenly spreads out. Bats with two heads, the size of palm, fly out in groups.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two headed bats, their claws and teeth are highly toxic, hemolytic seal!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Separate and gather at the top of the hill at the other end of the jungle.&rdquo; As soon as Feng Yan&rsquo;s face changed, he immediately exclaimed. His body shook and changed his direction, and his speed suddenly burst out.</p>
<p>Du Lingfei&rsquo;s eyes also contracted. When she waved, a piece of Rune paper appeared in front of her body, slowly burning and emitting blue light, which turned into a light curtain covering her whole body. She quickly got up, changed her direction and quickly separated. When she looked back, she was stunned and found that Bai Xiaochun, who was supposed to be the last one, had already disappeared.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun here, as early as the wind appeared, he immediately retreated. He likes to be safe and careful. Therefore, he is more sensitive to danger than ordinary people.</p>
<p>At this moment, as they retreated, the bats, with a hum, broke into three parts and pursued them respectively.</p>
<p>In the jungle, Feng Yan sneered at the corner of his mouth and quickly took away a piece of incense in his hand. The reason why these bats appear is because of this fragrance. He chose to stop here and shuttle through the jungle because he once went out on a mission and realized that there were such two headed bats in the jungle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any one of them is not inferior to three layers of condensate. Bai Xiaochun, don&rsquo;t blame me. Someone wants you to die.&rdquo; With a faint smile, Feng Yan patted the storage bag, took out a piece of black wood and blew it slightly. The wood was burning and emitting black smoke. All of a sudden, the bats chasing after him made a sharp sound, as if disgusted by the smoke and dispersed in a crowd.</p>
<p>Feng Yan laughed and walked forward with ease, gradually disappearing.</p>
<p>In the jungle, Bai Xiaochun is very fast. The bats behind him roar after him. However, no matter how fast these bats can speed up, they still can&rsquo;t catch up with Bai Xiaochun. After a while, Bai Xiaochun completely pulls away the distance. Sometimes, a bat makes a sharp sound and falls down.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun trots all the way, stops after a stick of incense, looks behind her eyes, but frowns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with these bats.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun went back along the original road and picked up a bat that he had killed with a flying sword. After a careful look, his eyes suddenly brightened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is not a double headed bat. This is a Purple Striped bat. Although it is equally poisonous, its teeth are the main material for refining the second-order miraculous medicine burning blood fragrance!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This kind of material can only be exchanged for 50 contribution points within the clan.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun was immediately surprised. This is the content of the fifth chapter of the spirit beast. There are not many people who can recognize it.</p>
<p>Under his heart, he quickly collected the corpses of bats. Before long, he found more than ten bats. After pulling out their teeth, he was quite moved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This bat is very weak&hellip;&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun laughs. The light curtain outside his body appears. He begins to look for it in the jungle. Soon, a group of Purple Striped bats find him and come roaring.</p>
<p>When Bai Xiaochun pinched the formula with his right hand, the speed of the flying sword suddenly increased, and he went straight to the bats. The speed was too fast. Before the bats came near, they all screamed bitterly and were penetrated and fell down. Even though a few of them were near, they bumped into the protective light curtain outside Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s body and were bounced up.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun put all of them away and found that there was no danger at all. He felt more at ease and held his head high and looked for it again.</p>
<p>In this way, he was alone in the jungle, constantly searching, collecting more and more teeth</p>
<p>Two hours later, Feng Yan left the jungle and went to the appointed peak. He sat cross legged, smiling and waiting in silence.</p>
<p>Another hour later, Du Lingfei rushed out in a panic. She looked back at the dark jungle and left quickly. When she got to the top of the mountain, she saw Feng Yan. Her eyes swept, but she didn&rsquo;t find Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bai Xiaochun hasn&rsquo;t come yet?&rdquo; She asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Younger martial brother Bai, please help yourself. Unfortunately, the two headed bats in the jungle are most active at night. If we rush in again, we will be unable to protect ourselves.&rdquo; Feng Yan sighed and shook his head with a bitter smile. In order to be more realistic, he simply did not rest, but put on a nervous and worried appearance, staring at the jungle below.</p>
<p>Du Lingfei was silent. Although she hated Bai Xiaochun, she could not hope that Bai Xiaochun would die. After all, she was a member of the same family. At the moment, she sat down cross legged and looked down at the jungle below. After a long time, she sighed.</p>
<p>Time went by, and soon it was dawn.</p>
<p>After waiting for a night, Du Lingfei did not see Bai Xiaochun appear. She had some premonitions in her heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It hasn&rsquo;t come out yet. Bai Xiaochun is afraid that It&rsquo;s more dangerous than lucky. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all my fault. If I hadn&rsquo;t proposed to walk in this jungle, younger martial brother Bai would not have Ah Feng Yan got up and didn&rsquo;t rest all night. He had blood in his eyes. He looked sad and angry and looked at the jungle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elder martial brother Feng, don&rsquo;t blame yourself. We didn&rsquo;t expect that there would be double headed bats here. Maybe Bai Xiaochun hasn&rsquo;t died. Even if he did, we, as fellow disciples, took his body away!&rdquo; Du Lingfei&rsquo;s heart is a little complicated. She doesn&rsquo;t know what kind of emotion it is. She thinks of Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s appearance. Although she still hates her, she can&rsquo;t bear it more. After all, there is no deep hatred between them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What Ms. Du said is that we can&rsquo;t give up anyway.&rdquo; Feng Yan took a deep breath and nodded solemnly. They were about to go down the mountain to look for it.</p>
<p>But at this time, they immediately saw that in the jungle at the foot of the mountain, Bai Xiaochun gasped and walked out unsteadily. Even when she came out, she stretched herself.</p>
<p>Du Lingfei&rsquo;s eyes widened, and Feng Yan&rsquo;s eyes on the other side were incredible. He looked at Bai Xiaochun, who was very relaxed and walked up the mountain road.</p>
<p>In particular, the appearance of each other, as if they had a good sleep and were in high spirits. On the contrary, it was the two of them who had little rest this night and were slightly tired.</p>
<p>After a while, Bai Xiaochun went up the mountain. After seeing them, she ran over and said hello.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning, elder martial brother Feng and elder sister Du. It&rsquo;s so terrible in the jungle that I almost lost my life.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun did have a good rest. He killed almost all the bats in the jungle. He not only gained a lot, but also had a good sleep in the cave of bats.</p>
<p>Du Lingfei looks ugly. She stares at Bai Xiaochun and snorts coldly. Seeing the other party&rsquo;s appearance, she remembers her previous complex intolerance. She suddenly feels that Bai Xiaochun is more hateful.</p>
<p>There was a flash of cold light in Feng Yan&rsquo;s eyes, but on the surface he showed joy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Younger martial brother Bai is fine. We worried all night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun ha ha smile, seems as usual, but in the depth of his eyes, the same cold flash.</p>
<p>After a while, Bai Xiaochun suggested a boat flight at night and a hike during the day. Du Lingfei rarely objected. Feng yanlue thought and nodded.</p>
<p>Three people slowly away, along the Tongtian River, toward the downstream.</p>
<p>Time went by, and soon it was a month.</p>
<p>In this month, Bai Xiaochun has gone through the most roads in his life. He sees mountains after mountains and forests, and the whole world is like a wilderness.</p>
<p>Once, when the three of them were on their way, suddenly the earth trembled. Bai Xiaochun was shocked to find that there was a giant with countless hair all over his body among the mountains in the distance. He walked slowly and step by step. Every time the giant fell, the ground was shaking.</p>
<p>This giant, let Bai Xiaochun take a breath.</p>
<p>Another night, their boat was flying, and suddenly lightning roared in the distance. Bai Xiaochun saw one There are giant birds about the size of Xiangyun mountain, whistling by, and countless lightning are swimming on it. It looks amazing at night.</p>
<p>What impressed Bai Xiaochun most was that they saw a fierce beast with short limbs and a small head like a hill. On the Bank of Tongtian River, a golden crocodile with a length of ten thousand feet leaped out of the Tongtian River and devoured the fierce beast with cold eyes. They also took a distant look at the white Xiaochun three people who were hiding in the distance 。</p>
<p>Only at one glance, all three people&rsquo;s minds were buzzing, the corners of their mouths overflowed with blood, and their headache was about to crack for several days before they recovered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s terrible, outside, it&rsquo;s terrible!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun shivered and muttered for a long time.</p>
