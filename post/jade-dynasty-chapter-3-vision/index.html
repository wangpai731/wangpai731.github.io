      <p>In Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s eyes, the clouds in the sky, whether it is white clouds or dark clouds, have never seen as close to the ground as the black clouds tonight, the thunder has never been so deafening, the lightning has never been so dazzling, almost making it difficult for him Look straight.</p>
<p>It seems that this day is about to fall.</p>
<p>He stood there staring blankly, watching the men in black and the old monk in the grass temple glaring at each other as a way of fighting.</p>
<p>Suddenly, at the moment when a thunder blew and his ears buzzed, he saw a bright flash of lightning appearing in the sky, and he broke into the earth and fell on the black man&rsquo;s long sword.</p>
<p>For a moment, the clothes in the black man&rsquo;s body bulged high, his eyes wide open, as if they were about to burst. At this time, in this grass temple, under the strong illumination of electric light, it was like the day.</p>
<p>The lightning that bloomed on the tip of the sword in the night was so beautiful that Zhang Xiaofan held his breath, and in the eyes of Pu Zhi, strange fanaticism appeared again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this the power of Taoism?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hearing a loud cry from the man in black, the sword tactics on his left hand spurred his wrist with all his strength. The thunder blew, and the sword was shot with electricity and directed towards Pu Zhi. Along the way, the plants, trees, and bricks were all shocked, and only the middle road left a deep scorching mark.</p>
<p>Pu Zhi retreated three steps in a row, removed his handprints, folded his palms together, his face was solemn, his body gleamed with a faint golden light, and said lowly, &ldquo;My Buddha is compassionate!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a &ldquo;snap&rdquo; sound, I saw only the seven jasper rosary beads left in front of him were broken into pieces, and the word &ldquo;Buddha&rdquo; was magically formed three feet in front of him.</p>
<p>At the next moment, Dianguang and the Buddha character collided together.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan suddenly felt that his heart was beating suddenly, as if all the blood in his body was flowing back in an instant. He had soft hands and feet and could not breathe. He only felt that at that moment, the wind stopped, and the rest stopped, and the whole world stopped.</p>
<p>Then, he flew back involuntarily, and when he was too scared to see it, he saw the white light and golden awn, which was more brilliant than the sun in the sky. The entire grass temple was torn apart, centered on the two of the fighting methods, and flew out in all directions, including the sky.</p>
<p>In one heart, he was empty, only felt the fierce wind, and flew through his ears constantly.</p>
<p>He felt scared and subconsciously wanted to curl up, but he was powerless and had to let himself drift to unknown places.</p>
<p>In his mind, an idea came up: Am I dying?</p>
<p>Severe fear suddenly hit his heart, and he sweated coldly and shivered slightly.</p>
<p>When death stands in front of it, how to face it?</p>
<p>He fainted and did not wake up personnel.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Pu Zhi walked slowly, staggering, with Zhang Xiaofan and Lin Jingyu sandwiched under his ribs, to a slightly clean place, put the two children down gently, and suddenly felt a severe pain in the whole body, almost cracked, and never again Unable to support, he sat down.</p>
<p>He looked to his chest and saw that through the burnt monk&rsquo;s clothes, he could vaguely see that a black air had gradually closed around his chest, leaving only a small place in his heart, which had not been attacked.</p>
<p>He grinned bitterly and reached for a grope in his arms. His hands shook violently, and after a while, he slowly figured out a red pill, about the size of a finger, flat.</p>
<p>Pu Zhi sighed and whispered: &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think of Ghost Doctor&rsquo;s words. I still have to serve him with this&rsquo;three days of death pills&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He hesitated and finally nodded, swallowing the pill.</p>
<p>Then he raised his head and looked to the distant mountains.</p>
<p>It finally rained in the sky.</p>
<p>Qingyun Mountain stands in the wind and rain, hazy and mysterious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Taoist technique, which is really amazing, can actually make the gods of the heavens. If you and my Buddhists prove each other and learn from each other&rsquo;s strengths and weaknesses, you will be able to participate in the mystery of immortality. But it is a pity that Daoxuan Zhenren&rsquo;s practice is far superior to me, but after all it is with me. The three brothers are average, they can&rsquo;t let go of the door, they can&rsquo;t let go of their status. Alas!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pu Zhi sighed, withdrawn his eyes, and fell on the two children. At this time the rain was getting bigger and wet their heads and faces. The Cao Temple has been torn apart in the fighting method just now, and there is nothing nearby that can completely shield the wind and rain.</p>
<p>His heart tightened suddenly, and he could not help worrying about the two children. He just fortified Zhenyuan and used the power of the &ldquo;Great Brahma Prajna&rdquo; in Tianyin Temple to borrow the power of the &ldquo;Jadeite Rosary&rdquo; from the Buddha&rsquo;s treasure, and gave birth to the magic power of the demon, only to block the magical magic weapon of the evil man. &ldquo;, and frustrated and hit him so hard that he escaped in shock. But he was seriously wounded, and he was hit by Taoism&rsquo;s thaumaturgy again. He was so exhausted that even the last line of vitality was extinct. Right now he is just relying on the miracle medicine given by the ghost doctor &ldquo;Three Days To Die Pill&rdquo; to prolong his life and extend his life by three days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The demon was seriously wounded, but he didn&rsquo;t hurt at all. After I left, he would go back to killing and killing. By then, not only these two children, but also the lives of the whole village are in danger. This, this, how is this good? ?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was very upset with Taoism, but he knew he was going to die, and his mind was a bit chaotic. Second, he worried about the lives of innocent people, but the demon seemed to be a person with great status in Qingyun Gate. If you rush to the mountain for help, you are afraid that the success will be insufficient and the failure will be more than enough.</p>
<p>But the most regrettable thing in his mind, but there is one thing, that is, his lifelong wish, he could not finish it. As the four great monks of Tianyin Temple, he admires the world and has great honor, but for him, what is more important is to break the mystery of life and death and untie the knot of long life and death. Only 50 years ago, he realized that no matter how diligently he practiced Buddhism and Taoism, he could only enhance his skill and practice, but not solve the mystery of life and death.</p>
<p>He thought hard about it, and after decades, he really thought of an unprecedented way. Fang today, the three religions of Buddhism, Taoism, and Devil are the most prosperous, and their skills are the highest and deepest. Demon religions have a bad reputation, evil arts are cruel, and people do not want them; while Taoist magic arts are profound and magical, and they are good at the field with Buddhism. If they can work together to study, they will definitely break the deadlock.</p>
<p>But he never thought that the three brothers who had always been open-minded objected in unison, thinking that the heresy was whimsical, and the anti-bitterness advised more than heart. He was unwilling, but visited Taoist famous gates several times. Qingyun Mountain went up several times, but all refused to teach the Taoist Xuanzhen people.</p>
<p>Thinking of this, he laughed bitterly, quite self-deprecating, and said, &ldquo;He only has three days of life, but he still wants to live forever, wouldn&rsquo;t he be disturbing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was just that although he opened his chest, but when he saw the two children lying on the ground, he couldn&rsquo;t put it down in his heart, and he couldn&rsquo;t think of any good strategy at all. He looked to the left and right, and saw a pine tree in the distance, It is still possible to cover up one or two winds and rains, and talk better than nothing. At the moment, fight hard, pick up two children, and try to walk there.</p>
<p>Finally, he walked under the tree and put down the two carefully. Pu Zhi was exhausted, and he fell to the ground all at once, leaning back against the tree trunk and kept breathing.</p>
<p>Heaven and earth are benevolent, with all things as ruminating dogs!</p>
<p>This Taoist famous quote brought a little bit of anger and slowly read it out of Pu Zhi&rsquo;s mouth.</p>
<p>The sky is like ink, and it covers the earth. The endless dark clouds pressed the top, and the rain fell from the sky, thin and dense, the cold wind blowing, bit by bit, hit the face, and the cold reached my heart.</p>
<p>He looked up at the sky for a while, and then slowly withdrawn his gaze, looking at the two children in front of him, and whispered: &ldquo;Two little donors, Lao Guan has a heart to save each other, but has no choice but to be powerless. The matter started from me, but it hurts. Two people, what a sin! Alas, if you two are disciples of Qingyun, on that Qingyun Mountain, among the people, I am afraid that they are safer, but now&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly, Pu Zhi shuddered and muttered in his mouth: &ldquo;Qingyun disciple, Qingyun disciple&hellip;&rdquo; His thoughts changed sharply, as if he had caught what he had thought of, but he was about to lose it in the blink of an eye. In a moment, he had a cold sweat.</p>
<p>Then, in his eyes, somehow, the inexplicable fanaticism reappeared.</p>
<p>He laughed in the sky, but there was a trace of madness in the laughter!</p>
<p>&ldquo;MiaoJiao, MiaoJi! Although my life is about to end soon, but if I teach a Buddhist skill, and then let him invest under the Qingyun Gate, to practice Taoist techniques, wouldn&rsquo;t it kill two birds with one stone, both save his life and accomplish it for me? wish!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The two schools of Buddhism and Dao have been separated from each other since ancient times, and they have never communicated with each other. Qingyunmen never expected that a young boy who lived under the Qingyun Mountain since childhood and would be pregnant with Buddhism. As long as there are two people who are both The puzzle of immortality over the years. Hey, if so, why should I die?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as he thought about it, the whole person was extremely excited, his cheeks were red, his eyes were bloodshot, and he subconsciously saw Lin Jingyu&rsquo;s body, his hand stretched out. But when he reached halfway, he stopped again and thought in his mind: This matter is of great importance. The views of the portals of various schools today are extremely important, and it is extremely taboo to steal the teacher. If it is known to everyone, the matter is exposed, it will definitely die. Lin Jingyu is a child with excellent qualifications. If it is included under Qingyun Gate, it will surely attract the attention of the teacher. At his young age, he was afraid that he would not be able to hide the big secret of this day!</p>
<p>Thinking of this, his heart moved, and his eyes turned to Zhang Xiaofan, remembering his stubborn nature during the day and not bowing his head, nodded and said, &ldquo;The qualifications are less, don&rsquo;t hurry, look at your own in the future Made it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After finishing speaking, without hesitation, reached out and took a few shots on Zhang Xiaofan, with the residual Buddha power, to wake him up.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan woke up wandering, his eyes blurred and his buzzing in his ears. It took a while for it to return to normal, seeing what was right in front of me, and he was startled and opened his mouth wide.</p>
<p>I saw the old monk with bruises all over his body. He was sitting in front of him. His left body was burnt, burnt and ugly, his face was black, and his face was dead. But somehow, the old monk looked excited and smiled. In addition, he also saw the playmate Lin Jingyu lying aside, unconscious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You, what are you doing?&rdquo; Zhang Xiaofan froze for a while before asking.</p>
<p>Pu Zhi didn&rsquo;t answer. He asked him in detail and asked, &ldquo;Little donor, this wind and rain, you are a child&rsquo;s home, why come to this remote place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was startled and said, &ldquo;I saw you still standing in the temple in the evening, and it looked like it was going to rain in the evening. It&rsquo;s very broken here. I think it will be cold and I will give you something to eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pu Zhi&rsquo;s mouth twitched, and he said: &ldquo;Sin Zai, Shan Zai. Everything is destiny, and it is destined to be doomed early, my Buddha is compassionate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan wondered: &ldquo;What are you talking about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pu Zhi smiled and said: &ldquo;Lao Qu is saying that the little donor is destined to me. That being the case, Lao guan has a set of practice methods. Can the little donor be willing to learn?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan said: &ldquo;What is Famen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pu Zhi froze for a moment, then laughed, stretched out his thin palm, and touched his small head, saying, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not something, it&rsquo;s just teaching you some breathing methods. After you learn, you have to promise me a few Things, okay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan seemed to understand, but still said: &ldquo;You say it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pu Zhidao said: &ldquo;You never talk about it to anyone else, even a loved one can&rsquo;t say it, can you do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan nodded and said, &ldquo;Got it, I won&rsquo;t die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pu Zhi was shocked. When he saw his young age, his face was so stoic. The rain in the sky was like a sword like a frost, which wet his little face, and he was a little haggard.</p>
<p>Suddenly took a deep breath, Pu Zhi lowered his eyes and stopped looking at him, but continued in his mouth: &ldquo;In addition, you must practice this method once a day, but you can&rsquo;t practice in front of people. You can only do it in the deep night and when people are quiet. Finally, you must not perform this technique at the critical moment of life or death, otherwise there will be a big disaster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Speaking of which, he opened his eyes again and stared at Zhang Xiaofan, saying, &ldquo;Have you done it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan hesitated, tilted his head, and scratched his head again, his face confused, but eventually nodded heavily.</p>
<p>Pu Zhi smiled slightly, and without further ado, he began to preach a set of mantras.</p>
<p>This set of mantras said that it was not long, only about a thousand words, but it was awkward and difficult. Zhang Xiaofan tried his best and spent three hours before he could do everything.</p>
<p>Pu Zhi treated him completely and remembered this time. He was relieved this time, and he looked very tired. He looked at Zhang Xiaofan and couldn&rsquo;t help but have the color of love in his eyes. He said: &ldquo;Lao Qin has practiced his entire life and has never touched the idea of ​​accepting a disciple. When he was about to die, he had a relationship with you. I should know my name.&rdquo; He paused and said, &ldquo;My name is Puzhi, and I am a monk of Tianyin Temple. Er, boy, do you know Tianyin Temple?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan thought about it and shook his head.</p>
<p>Pu Zhi laughed dumbly and said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really a child.&rdquo; Then he remembered something and reached out to find a deep purple bead in his arms. After looking at it for a few times, he handed it to Zhang Xiaofan and said, &ldquo;You also put this bead Keep it away and don’t let outsiders see it. When you settle down in the future, you will find a deep valley cliff and throw it down, that’s it. Also, I’ve just told you the name, and you must not talk about it to outsiders. .&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan took the beads and said, &ldquo;I see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pu Zhi touched his head and said, &ldquo;You and I have this kind of fate. I don&rsquo;t know if you can meet each other in the next life? Child, just kneel down and knock me three heads, call me a master!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan looked at Pu Zhi, but he saw that he had put away his smile, and his face was solemn. Now he nodded and said yes, &ldquo;Master.&rdquo; He knelt down on the ground and knocked three heads heavily. He had just finished tapping, and in order to raise his head, he heard Pu Zhi chuckling softly, but the laughter was quite sad and decisive.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was about to look up at him, but suddenly his back was beaten, and his eyes suddenly turned black, and he was unconscious again.</p>
