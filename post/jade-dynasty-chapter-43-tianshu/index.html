      <p>I saw Biyao stand up and take a look at Zhang Xiaofan. He looked elsewhere and stood still. His brow frowned, but he didn&rsquo;t say anything. He said lightly, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan had some good feelings for the woman when he came in the tunnel, but when he saw these two evil gods, he thought of the difference between the sects and the teachings of his teacher since he was a child. Naturally, he was cold, nodded slightly, and said, &ldquo;OK.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After seeing him, Biyao went deeper in. Zhang Xiaofan followed her. This time, she didn&rsquo;t go far. She went into a spacious place. But it&rsquo;s not like the stone room outside. It&rsquo;s a grotesque cave with all kinds of stalactites hanging upside down. In front of the two people, there is a huge stele standing at the entrance. On the top of it, there are ten words: Heaven and earth are not benevolent, and everything is the ruminant dog!</p>
<p>Each of these ten characters is almost half the size of a person. It has an ancient and unsophisticated brushwork and vigorous brushwork. It goes straight to the dragon and snake, but it comes out face-to-face and roars in the sky.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan didn&rsquo;t see much at first, but after looking at it for a moment, he suddenly felt that his head was in a daze, and the whole person could not help but step back.</p>
<p>He was startled and quickly calmed down, but saw that the word was still on the monument, motionless, but it was really scary.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was surprised. In a second, she saw that Biyao had bypassed the monument and walked deep into the cave. Then she followed. Around the stone tablet, I saw that behind it, there were all kinds of strange stalactites. They walked around in the stone forest for a while, and Biyao who was walking in front of them suddenly stopped and cried softly.</p>
<p>And almost at the same time, Zhang Xiaofan suddenly found that the firebrand he used to fix his arm suddenly flashed a strange light, especially the bead in the front of the firebrand. But this time it was soft. It was like meeting old friends and acquaintances that we haven&rsquo;t seen for many years. With endless thoughts and thoughts.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan looked forward in surprise, and looked through the side of Biyao. He saw the scene that surprised Biyao in front of him: the bottom of the cave is a smooth stone wall, and there is a tunnel on both sides of the stone wall leading to the unknown place. But under the stone wall is a bluestone platform, on which there is a skeleton, sitting in the shape of an end, sitting there quietly.</p>
<p>And the bead on the fire stick, at the moment, glowed a soft blue light on the skeleton.</p>
<p>Biyao stood in front of him and didn&rsquo;t notice Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s strange expression and the change of his firestick. After the initial shock, she quickly calmed down.</p>
<p>After all, she is a member of the demon sect. How can you be afraid of a skeleton? Go ahead and look carefully, but you don&rsquo;t see any accidents. Turn your head to smile at Zhang Xiaofan and say, &ldquo;maybe this is the black heart old man who was famous eight hundred years ago!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan naturally had no good feelings for the people in the demon sect. He snorted and said, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s find out if there is any way out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biyao took a look at him, sipped her mouth, and said, &ldquo;you should find it yourself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan stayed for a while, some of them could not face it. Hum, unexpectedly turn around and walk into the left tunnel.</p>
<p>Without two steps, he shook his head to himself secretly, and felt that he could not hold his breath in the face of the demon woman. When she was stimulated, she would react so much, for fear that she might be sneering and laughing in her eyes at the moment.</p>
<p>But want to return to think, since stepped out of the footsteps can not turn back, walked a few steps, there is no movement behind. It seems that Biyao didn&rsquo;t keep up with Zhang Xiaofan. Somehow, Zhang Xiaofan seems to be lost, but then he secretly scolds himself for being &ldquo;unproductive&rdquo;. Cheer up and walk carefully to the depth of the tunnel. Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s tunnel is the same as the road when he came from outside, but it&rsquo;s so deep and quiet. Looking into the deep distance, it&rsquo;s almost dark, and the road seems to be relatively long. I can&rsquo;t imagine how those people in the blood refining Hall of the demon cult started such a huge project.</p>
<p>After walking like this for a long time, Zhang Xiaofan suddenly found that the front was gradually brightened. He was three summers in his heart. He stepped forward quickly, only to see the soft light at the end of the road ahead. It was clear in the dark, like a soft touch, tempting people in the world.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan breathed deeply and stepped into the light.</p>
<p>Seeing Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s figure disappear in the tunnel, Biyao was shocked and her face sank. Her father is a high-ranking figure in the demon sect. She has been like a princess since she was a child. No one dares to disobey her.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, she was in a desperate situation today, but she met a middle-aged man with a good temper. She couldn&rsquo;t help being angry.</p>
<p>When Zhang Xiaofan was in Qingyun Mountain, he was also a kind young man. Why did he bump with Biyao? Apart from his opinions, he was afraid that he could not make it clear.</p>
<p>These things are unknown to Biyao. However, Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s repeated disagreements with her are really in his eyes, and the eldest one&rsquo;s discomfort. At present, both of them are in the Jedi, and it&rsquo;s not easy to teach him a lesson, so he just snorted and remembered them. But it&rsquo;s impossible for Biyao to go with Zhang Xiaofan.</p>
<p>She turned, almost without thinking, and went into the tunnel on the right.</p>
<p>After a few steps, Biyao felt that it was a road similar to the outer tunnel, but there were fewer things shining on both sides of the stone wall, which made the tunnel a little dark.</p>
<p>Fortunately, this road is not very long, and soon Baguio came to the end and stepped into a stone chamber again.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a medium-sized stone chamber with many shelves on one side and a pile of rubbish on the other. Most of the iron tools, such as knives, swords and guns, are damaged. The obvious purpose is to throw an axe on the top at will. The whole body of iron is quite huge and complete. It looks like it&rsquo;s made of iron.</p>
<p>After two eyes, Bagao lost interest. She turned to the shelves and looked at them. Her face first showed the color of great joy, but soon she could not help but change into the color of disappointment.</p>
<p>There are labels on the shelves one by one. Some of the words on the shelves have been blurred for a long time, but some of them can barely be seen clearly. However, all of them are names like &ldquo;five mountain halberd&rdquo;, &ldquo;guanyuesuo&rdquo; and &ldquo;departing cone&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Since she was a child, Biyao grew up in the demon sect. Her father is a wizard who knows all the time and has a profound family knowledge. Naturally, she knows that these are the first-class magic weapons in the rumors of the demon sect. How unhappy? Unfortunately, on these shelves, most of them have labels but no real objects. I&rsquo;m happy.</p>
<p>She sighed, but she was still lucky. She looked at the shelves one by one, and saw that every shelf was empty. Maybe the emperor is willing to help others. I found a small iron box for her in the last grid, but there was no label on the shelf, and I didn&rsquo;t know what was in it.</p>
<p>A burst of joy filled Biyao&rsquo;s heart. She carefully reached out and picked up the box. She felt that her hands were heavy. Gently shake a few times, but no sound.</p>
<p>As soon as Baguio pondered, he put the iron box on the ground, took a deep breath, and was alert. With a wave of his right hand, the white light in the stone chamber suddenly rose, and a jade like flower suddenly appeared in the air, giving off a faint fragrance.</p>
<p>Baguio looked solemn and turned her right hand. The little flower standing in the air is full of light, flying to the top of the iron box, and the white light covers the whole iron box.</p>
<p>Then, Biyao carefully reached out to open the small box. As soon as she pressed the lid of the iron box, Biyao felt that it didn&rsquo;t seem to be locked. She frowned and her eyes were more alert. She bit the teeth of the shell and opened the lid of the iron box.</p>
<p>He only heard a soft sound of &ldquo;Ka&rdquo;, but he didn&rsquo;t see what was in the iron box. A black gas came out first.</p>
<p>Biyao&rsquo;s face changed greatly, almost turned over like an electric shock, and the white flower on the top of the iron box rushed down immediately, and the black gas was suddenly covered by the white light. Several impulses did not come out. After a while, he saw that the black gas was gradually shrinking, while the jade like white flower was gradually turning black, which was actually sucking in the black gas.</p>
<p>Until the black gas completely dissipated, Bagao also waited for a long time before coming. She looked at her little flower with concentration. Her father devoted great efforts to make her special treasure &ldquo;sad flower&rdquo;. At this moment, the petals of white jade had become purple and black, which was somewhat ferocious.</p>
<p>Biyao&rsquo;s face changed slightly, and she said in a low voice: &ldquo;ancient corpse poison&rdquo;! Black heart old man is really black heart. He even tried this kind of thing! &quot;</p>
<p>At the same time, she cursed the evil cult elder blackheart in a low voice and threw her eyes into the iron box.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very simple. There is only one thing in a small iron box: a small bell with golden color, intact as a prayer.</p>
<p>After staying for a while, Biyao didn&rsquo;t expect that there was such a rare and highly poisonous thing as &ldquo;ancient corpse poison&rdquo; in the iron box. She just kept such a small bell. She looked left and right, but she didn&rsquo;t see anything strange. She pondered for a while, and slowly reached out to pick up the small bell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jingle&rdquo;.</p>
<p>A clear sound, like reverberating in people&rsquo;s hearts, resounds in the secret stone chamber which has been quiet for 800 years.</p>
<p>Baguio picked up the bell, but saw that the bell was delicate and delicate. A thin iron rope was tied to the bell, and when it was shaken slightly, the bell struck the bell gently, making a sound again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ding Jingle. &quot;</p>
<p>In the eyes of Biyao, the girl&rsquo;s heart and nature are very fond of it. The disappointment just now has also diluted a lot. Now, after carefully checking it, it&rsquo;s true that it&rsquo;s not weird. It seems that it&rsquo;s a common bell with exquisite production.</p>
<p>But black heart old man&rsquo;s collection is so mysterious and prudent. This bell must have something extraordinary. I&rsquo;ll ask my father when I have a chance to go out.</p>
<p>Baguio thought so, and settled down. But seeing the little bell, she liked it more and more. She tied it to her waist and turned her body. As expected, there were a series of clear bells, which were very pleasant. Baguio was very proud and nodded.</p>
<p>After that, she examined the stone chamber carefully, but there was no harvest. Even after she checked the garbage, she had nothing to pay attention to, let alone a way out.</p>
<p>After busy, Biyao slowly stood up. It&rsquo;s time to see the situation of that silly boy.</p>
<p>Before going out of the stone room, she finally looked back and saw that the stone room was still messy. After she turned over the garbage, it was even messy. All kinds of weapons were lost, and the big axe was also randomly thrown in the corner.</p>
<p>Then she walked out of the stone chamber.</p>
<p>The tunnel on the left that Zhang Xiaofan just entered is much longer than the road on the right that Biyao entered. Biyao walked for a long time before she saw the light come on, but she still couldn&rsquo;t see the situation clearly, but somehow there wasn&rsquo;t any movement in it. She had a faint worry in her heart. There are many strange and cruel things in the magic town. It&rsquo;s strange and unpredictable. Will it</p>
<p>Subconsciously, she quickened her pace, stepped into the stone chamber, and looked carefully. This just put down the heart to come, see Zhang Xiaofan standing in the stone room, looking at the stone wall, stunned.</p>
<p>Biyao is relieved. Then I carefully observed the stone chamber. I saw that the stone chamber was much larger than the one she had just arrived in, but it was empty and had nothing. But on the hard wall of the stone chamber, there are many stone inscriptions. It&rsquo;s these things that Zhang Xiaofan is frowning at.</p>
<p>Biyao frowned and went to see it. When she saw it, her face looked happy. At the beginning of the whole stone carving, she only had two characters.</p>
<p>Tianshu!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tianshu, this is Tianshu!&rdquo; Baguio could not help cheering.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s body shakes, only to find that Biyao comes to him, but his attention seems to be only on her words: &ldquo;Tianshu? Do you know what this heavenly book is? &quot;</p>
<p>Biyao gave him a look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can I not know that this&rdquo; Tianshu &ldquo;is our Holy Scripture. It has been passed down from ancient times to the present, and all the holy disciples&rsquo; magic skills have come from this Tianshu.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s body was shocked again, and his face was very confused. He turned to stare at the stone carvings on the wall. After a while, he whispered, &ldquo;no, it&rsquo;s impossible!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bagao&rsquo;s face sank. &ldquo;This is our Holy Scripture, but our top secret. Don&rsquo;t you say that we are evil?&rdquo;? How can I still peep? &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan seems to listen to the words on the wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Book of heaven Volume I&rdquo;</p>
<p>Man makes heaven and earth. When Gai called chaos, he was ignorant and undivided. The sun and the moon were full of splendor. Heaven and earth mixed with each other. The outline of the universe changed, and the turbidity was Chen.</p>
<p>So heaven and earth can grow long. Because it doesn&rsquo;t live on its own, it can last for a long time. However, all things in the world have their own aspects. All living beings are obsessed with me, people, living beings and longevity people. They think that all of them have their own reasons. They are afraid of three terrors and three poisons. It will not be long.</p>
<p>The heaven is without punishment and the Tao praises the nameless. That&rsquo;s why people who have no self, no one, no living beings and no life are able to reach the light. He who holds one right way, inner body and self nature, and heaven and earth take this as the heart.</p>
<p>Therefore, in the world of motion and rest, the mind of heaven and earth sees.</p>
<p>Therefore, there is no reality, no emptiness.</p>
<p>Therefore, the heaven and the earth are free of nature, and nothing can be done without creation.</p>
<p>Therefore, if things are not kept, they are not enough to be prepared!</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>Biyao snorted. She wanted to get angry, but when she thought about it, she didn&rsquo;t say anything. She also looked at the wall. After a few words, she felt dizzy and admired Zhang Xiaofan. He could read such dry and astringent words.</p>
<p>However, when I turned around to see Zhang Xiaofan, I was slightly shocked. I saw that his face was full of pain and confusion, and the whole person was a little trembling, unspeakable strange feeling.</p>
<p>In fact, for anyone in the world, I&rsquo;m afraid that Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s mood is not excited at this time. In Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s eyes, the so-called &ldquo;heavenly script&rdquo; of the so-called &ldquo;general outline&rdquo; almost stabbed into his heart, even more than when he was a child, he found that the practice method of Qingyun Taoist school was opposite to that of the &ldquo;great Brahma Prajna&rdquo; which was spread by general wisdom.</p>
<p>From this passage, he found that there was a trend of different paths and the same destination in the practice of Taoism and Buddhism, which he thought secretly from childhood.</p>
<p>Even though he was surprised, he could still accept it. But then he looked pale, because he found a big secret in the so-called &ldquo;heavenly book&rdquo; of the demon sect.</p>
<p>All kinds of miracles and methods in this demon sect are extreme and special, but the root is in the &ldquo;heavenly book&rdquo;. Taoism pays attention to body control and nature creation, Buddhism pays attention to self-awareness, but in the book of heaven, it seems to be all-around, including Taoism and Buddhism.</p>
<p>Another person, such as Biyao, naturally has no idea after reading these words. He always thinks it&rsquo;s a great magic power left by his grandfather. But in the eyes of Zhang Xiaofan, the only one in the world who knows the truth of Tao and Buddhism, it&rsquo;s a terrible thing.</p>
<p>An idea that never existed haunted him.</p>
<p>What is right?</p>
<p>He couldn&rsquo;t help but look down, pale and excited, with fanatical and strange curiosity. He only felt that a big secret was in front of him, but he couldn&rsquo;t touch it all the time. He couldn&rsquo;t see it, but he was more attracted to himself and ran towards that goal.</p>
<p>But, in his heart, there is also some fear. Is that right?</p>
<p>After watching Zhang Xiaofan for a long time, Biyao saw that he was still absorbed in the stone carvings on the wall. His expression was strange. He seemed to completely forget that he was standing next to him. He was angry for no reason. He snorted coldly. Unexpectedly, Zhang Xiaofan turned a deaf ear and didn&rsquo;t hear anything.</p>
<p>Baguio was annoyed when she took a sip at the corner of her mouth, but somehow she didn&rsquo;t want to teach this man a lesson. She turned around and walked out. She stepped on her feet when she left, but the silly boy didn&rsquo;t respond at all.</p>
<p>Biyao angrily went out of the stone room and went back to the stalactite cave. She was angry at the skeleton. It was nothing to think about, but she was not pleased with the boy. The more she thought about it, the angrier she was. Then she saw that the beautiful sad flower at hand was dark. She moved her anger to the black heart old man.</p>
<p>She pointed to the skeleton and said angrily, &ldquo;you dead old man, you&rsquo;ve been killing me for eight hundred years, making my Jade Flower become Become&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>A word can&rsquo;t go on, and Biyao&rsquo;s anger is getting bigger and bigger, let alone more. With a wave of his sleeve robe, &ldquo;sad flower&rdquo; flies out and turns around on the skeleton. A moment later, he hears the sound of bone crack. At the sound of &ldquo;KaKa&rdquo;, the skeleton falls in half.</p>
<p>After she made the move, Biyao&rsquo;s anger slowed down, and she regretted it. She didn&rsquo;t know where she came from. But when she saw it in a flash, she was surprised. There were several lines on the stone wall which was just covered by the skeleton. She hurriedly went to have a closer look, only four lines were written on the wall.</p>
<p>The bell swallows, the flowers wither,</p>
<p>The figure is becoming thin and frosty.</p>
<p>Love is bitter, life is bitter,</p>
<p>Infatuation is only bitter.</p>
