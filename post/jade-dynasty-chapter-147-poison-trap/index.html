      <p>Thousands of miles away, is also the general night, that bright moon hanging in the sky, quietly looking at this earthly world.</p>
<p>On the wilderness, there was also a man who looked up at the cold moon. His robe and long sleeves were still in Taoist costume. On his angular face, his momentum of not being angry but powerful was still vaguely visible.</p>
<p>The night wind on the field is blowing, and the weeds are shaking. Between the fluttering of clothes and the silence, it seems that time is still.</p>
<p>Just, who can keep time, in your trance, after all, or ten years.</p>
<p>Some people sigh, the voice is light, slowly drift in the wind.</p>
<p>In the silence, a voice came from afar, with a little smile, and said, &ldquo;the Taoist priest is in a good mood to enjoy the beautiful scenery on this beautiful day alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The voice was still far away at the beginning, but after one sentence, he was behind the Taoist. The Taoist took a deep breath and turned around. Under the moonlight, he was the Taoist Cangsong who had colluded with the evil cult and betrayed Qingyun ten years ago.</p>
<p>Standing not far behind him, however, was the smiling ghost king, the head of the ghost King&rsquo;s clan. At the moment, although the ghost King&rsquo;s face was as usual, his hair was white, and his appearance seemed to be haggard. Only in his eyes, there was another hot light, which was more dazzling than ever.</p>
<p>Cangsong Taoist looked at the ghost King&rsquo;s hair, and his calm and calm expression changed. He was shocked and said, &ldquo;Lord, how about your hair&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ghost King light smile, Cangsong Taoist have this kind of reaction, in fact, as early as he expected. For a man of profound practice, his appearance will not change much in the next hundred years. However, when his head suddenly turned white for three days, such as Cang song, the outsider who didn&rsquo;t know what to do with his practice was surprised and thought that he had encountered some problems in his practice.</p>
<p>The ghost king did not explain, and even there was no big change in his face. He only said with a smile, &ldquo;although you and I are all Taoist practitioners, we are mortals after all. We always have sad things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taoist Cangsong&rsquo;s face is restrained. &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m talkative,&rdquo; he said</p>
<p>The ghost King shook his head and laughed. He went to the Taoist Cangsong with his negative hand and said with a smile: &ldquo;no more. But since the Qingyun war ten years ago. I heard that Taoist priest was worshipped by Wandu gate. I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;ll meet here tonight. What&rsquo;s the matter? If this matter is known by the poison God, I will not care. But I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s inconvenient for the Taoist priest. &quot;</p>
<p>Cangsong Taoist looked at the ghost king for a long time, and the ghost king did not ask much. He still kept a smile and waited with a smile. After a long time, Cang song sighed: &ldquo;master, you are really not comparable to other people. To tell you the truth, I will meet the Lord tonight and discuss important matters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost king said, &ldquo;Taoist priest, please say so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cang song looked at the ghost king and said, &ldquo;master, you know, the master of the ten thousand poisons sect is the poison God. He died three days ago. &quot;</p>
<p>The voice of Taoist Cangsong was not very loud, but it was like a thunder in silence. Rao was such a determined figure as the ghost king. He could not help shaking his body and changed his face. He blurted out and said, &ldquo;what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cang song stares at the ghost king and says, &ldquo;the poison God has passed away three days ago. After his death, he left his will to pass the position of the sect leader to Qin Wuyan, the youngest disciple.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost King gradually calmed down, but his brows were still deep locked. Calm on the surface, but in the heart, as if thousands of troops came together, all kinds of ideas stirred.</p>
<p>Today, the three sects of the demon sect are facing each other. What he worries most about is that the old man has become a fine old poison of ten thousand poisonous sects. He will be there one day. Guiwangzong almost had no chance to pull down the Wandu gate from the position of the first faction of demon sect. But now, the old poison, which once seemed never to die, died so quietly!</p>
<p>The ghost King inhaled deeply, looked back at Taoist Cangsong&rsquo;s face again, and suddenly said with a smile: &ldquo;the old master of poison God is a highly respected elder of our holy religion. Unfortunately, he died. It&rsquo;s really sad. &quot; He said mourning words, but there was no sadness in his smile.</p>
<p>The Taoist Cangsong, who stood opposite him, was indifferent. It was obvious that neither of them had any memory of the dead old man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;However,&rdquo; the ghost King seemed to show a trace of caution and said, &ldquo;I have never heard of this news before I came here! During these three days, although the ten thousand poison gate was very calm, it did not reveal any news. &quot;</p>
<p>Taoist Cangsong chuckled and said with disdain: &ldquo;after the old man died, although Qin Wuyan was ordered to take over the position of headmaster, the other disciples who came back together to see him die were not willing to give up. They argued constantly for the position of the master, and temporarily suppressed the news of the old man&rsquo;s death. Now, most of the disciples of the ten thousand poison sect don&rsquo;t know about it except for a few offerings including me. &quot;</p>
<p>The ghost King&rsquo;s character was understood as soon as he heard it. A smile appeared on the corner of his mouth. He pondered for a moment. He said to Cang song, &ldquo;this is a very important thing. The Taoist priest told me about it. I am very grateful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cangsong Taoist laughed and said, &ldquo;I dare not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost King&rsquo;s eyes flashed and said, &ldquo;is there anything else the Taoist priest has to say, but it doesn&rsquo;t matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cangsong Taoist priest hummed and said, &ldquo;the master is a great master of great talent and vision, so I will not go around in circles. Now there is no place for Cang song in Wandu gate. I hope that the master will remember that time and accept me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The king of ghosts said in astonishment: &ldquo;where do you say that Taoist priest? I can&rsquo;t look forward to such a person as Taoist priest. I have been longing for him for many years. It&rsquo;s just that the Taoist priest has always been at the top of the Wandu sect, and he is also a member of the holy sect. I dare not invite you rashly. Is it possible that after the death of the poison God, what changes have not taken place? &quot;</p>
<p>Taoist Cangsong nodded his head and said, &ldquo;the Lord is so dazzling that the poison God is really good to me, but Qin Wuyan has always been at odds with me. Moreover, all the masters in the ten thousand poison sect are all fighting against each other according to the mountain top. In my opinion, even if someone can unify the poison gate, he must be very weak and can&rsquo;t fight for a long time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost King laughed, and the laughter was quite loud and clear. After a moment, he stopped smiling and said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t worry about the Taoist priest. Qin Wuyan is a yellow mouth child. I don&rsquo;t know the Taoist priest. Please come to my ghost King&rsquo;s sect and worship him. Everything should be done from the heart and without any worries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cang song Taoist face was happy, nodded: &ldquo;thank you so much, Lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost King nodded with a smile, and his eyes flashed: &ldquo;since the Taoist priest and I are already a family, I would like to ask the Taoist priest for advice. Who is the most hopeful one among the poison God&rsquo;s disciples to inherit the position of sect head?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cang song pondered for a long time and said: &ldquo;although the masters in the gate are divided and confronted, in my opinion, I&rsquo;m afraid that Qin Wuyan still has the best chance of winning. Although he was young, he had a deep mind, and he got the true story of poison God, which should not be underestimated. It&rsquo;s just that he died in the west a few months ago and was hurt by a ghost. It&rsquo;s said that the blood sucking demon is strange and incomparable. It goes deep into the bone marrow and has not yet recovered. So it was taken advantage of by some of his senior brothers. Otherwise, with his ability. Those bad senior brothers are far from his rivals. &quot;</p>
<p>When the ghost king was stunned, the ghost fierce ambush Qin Wuyan. Although it was also in the dead pool, GUI Li did not reveal it to the outside world, and he knew nothing about it. Suddenly, he heard Taoist Cangsong say this, and his heart couldn&rsquo;t help passing the ghost figure, and his eyes were full of light.</p>
<p>His eyes were so strong that even the Taoist Cangsong was surprised. He said in amazement, &ldquo;Lord, what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost King responded. Relieved, he said with a smile: &ldquo;nothing, but I didn&rsquo;t expect that I had cultivated this ferocious. Now it has become a big tool. I am very happy in my heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taoist Cangsong looked at him, his face was as usual, and he didn&rsquo;t say anything more. However, the figure of Zhang Xiaofan who was on the top of Qingyun Mountain ten years ago also appeared in his heart. He could not help but sneer at the expression of the ghost king just now.</p>
<p>Huqishan. The hall of ghost king.</p>
<p>Falling from the sky, the magic wand flickering with green light quietly flew back into the sleeve, and the ghostly figure once again appeared in front of the entrance of the guiwangzong hall.</p>
<p>In front of the door guards several ghost King clan disciple to be startled, then quickly to the side to let go. In the mouth one after another cries: &ldquo;vice patriarch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li didn&rsquo;t say anything. He walked in directly. Xiao Hui was lying on his shoulder, looking around as usual. But after a while, he took his eyes back. After all, it is too familiar here.</p>
<p>As like as two peas and a few thousand people walked back to their room and pushed away Shimen, everything in the room was exactly the same as before he left. He stood in the room for a long time as if he was thinking something. There was a rare hesitation and fear on his face. Xiao Hui jumped down from his shoulder, jumped onto the bed two or three times and went to play by himself.</p>
<p>GUI Li closed his lips and sighed suddenly. As if he had made some determination, he turned around and went out, and then went to the cold stone room in the deep of the mountain.</p>
<p>On the way, they met many disciples of the ghost King sect. But for the vice patriarch who disappeared for a long time and suddenly appeared, they all bowed their heads and walked away. In their eyes, it seemed that the farther away from this man, the better. However, GUI Li obviously didn&rsquo;t pay attention to the attitude of these people. He just walked forward silently. His room was not far away from the cold stone room. Soon before he got to the stone room, he saw the figure standing outside the stone room.</p>
<p>You Ji.</p>
<p>Suddenly, such an idea passed through my mind: how could it seem that every time I came to visit Biyao, you Ji seemed to be standing outside the stone chamber? It seems that she really has feelings for Biyao</p>
<p>Just as he was thinking about it, Youji seemed to hear the sound of footsteps. Looking up, she seemed to have no idea that the ghost would suddenly appear and her body would shake slightly.</p>
<p>GUI Li nodded to her in silence. He said hello. Then he passed by her and went to the door of the cold stone room.</p>
<p>Under the black veil, Youji is silent.</p>
<p>Just as GUI Li was about to reach out and push open the stone gate, he suddenly stopped, turned to look at you Ji and said, &ldquo;you&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He seldom talks with you Ji, but suddenly he doesn&rsquo;t know how to call you Ji.</p>
<p>You Ji light way: &ldquo;what does Biyao call me, you also call me what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was silence between the two men for a moment, but at last they said: &ldquo;aunt you, when I left last time, please send the ashes of the great wizard back to southern Xinjiang&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>You Ji black gauze ordered two times, low voice way: &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t worry, big brother has already sent, but I don&rsquo;t know how, he has not come back yet.&rdquo; She said, although you can&rsquo;t see the expression of Youji, but her voice still reveals a trace of rare anxiety. &ldquo;In southern Xinjiang, where the beast demon is rampant recently, elder brother, although he has profound Taoism, he still doesn&rsquo;t know why he hasn&rsquo;t come back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost frowned and remained silent for a moment. He said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t worry! The green dragon saint is good at Taoism, but those monsters can&rsquo;t do anything about him. &quot; He paused and said, &ldquo;then I&rsquo;ll go in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Youji nods silently and doesn&rsquo;t speak again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boom&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The heavy stone door made a low voice, opened and closed behind him. Once again, he was in the cold stone room and looked at the peaceful and beautiful figure silently.</p>
<p>From the ice gently floating on the silk white gas, a wisp of floating in the air, slowly swimming. It makes people feel a bit unreal. On the smooth ground, you can still see the remains of the original soul stirring magic method, and the dark red color seems to melt into the stone.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why. He began to tremble gently. Slowly, he walked step by step, stepping on the traces of residual red and passing through the faint white smoke. The serene face of Biyao appeared in front of her eyes.</p>
<p>It seems that she has never changed. In this way, she still vaguely remains the beautiful girl she met ten years ago</p>
<p>In front of the stone platform of Biyao, he leaned down gradually. In the stone chamber, he faintly heard the choking voice that he tried to suppress but could not suppress.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, the body swayed violently, with a backhand. It was a heavy slap on his face. The loud voice from the slap of his hand and face immediately reverberated in the stone chamber. It seemed that only in this way could the man&rsquo;s pain and regret be released.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry, Biyao, I&rsquo;m sorry&hellip;&rdquo; The low voice, trying to suppress his own voice, said so low, repeated.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how long it took. The quiet restored in the stone chamber was broken again, and the stone door was opened. A silver haired ghost King slowly came in and stood behind the ghost. GUI Li Fu&rsquo;s body moved and stood up slowly. And then turn back and look.</p>
<p>The two men&rsquo;s eyes contact each other, but they are all in a daze. What GUI Li sees is the ghost king with white hair, while the ghost king sees the five fingerprints slowly emerging on his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re back.&rdquo; Ghost King&rsquo;s voice sounds a little strange, there is a touch of comfort in the plain, but there is another kind of strange feeling that can not be said.</p>
<p>GUI Li nodded in silence. The ghost king is obviously used to the character of GUI Li. Don&rsquo;t care, said: &ldquo;you come with me for a while! There is an old acquaintance. I think you should see it. And there will be a big event in our ghost King clan soon. &quot;</p>
<p>GUI Li Wei was surprised. Obviously, he didn&rsquo;t know who the so-called old acquaintance was. However, judging from his appearance, he didn&rsquo;t want to know in his present state of mind. At the moment, he turned his head and looked at Biyao again. It seemed that he wanted to engrave this pale face in his eyes and never changed from now on. Then he turned and walked out.</p>
<p>The ghost King&rsquo;s eyes also turned gently on his daughter&rsquo;s body. There was a kind look in his eyes, and then he retreated out. When he turned around, no one could see the weakness.</p>
<p>Youji is still standing outside the door. The ghost king takes two steps and suddenly turns his head to Youji and says, &ldquo;come on, too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>You Ji slightly nods, also followed up.</p>
<p>The three men left the cold stone room, walked through the winding corridor, and came to a secluded house deep in the mountain. The ghost King pushed the door first and entered the stone room. The ghost king followed him and walked into the stone room. At the moment, there were two people in the stone room, one of whom was a mysterious ghost master with a black veil; the other had a square face and was a Taoist priest Cangsong.</p>
<p>Hearing the sound of footsteps, Cang song Taoist and Mr. ghost turned their heads.</p>
<p>When GUI Li and Cang song Taoist priest&rsquo;s eyes met, both of them were stunned. Ten years of time seemed to be a sudden pause, and it was like the merciless joke that heaven played to people with mockery. The people at Qingyun Mountain in those years! Now we meet under such circumstances.</p>
<p>In the dark, who controls everything?</p>
<p>The atmosphere in the room was a little silent for a moment, and no one spoke. Ghost Li and Cang song Taoist looked at each other without expression, but the expressions in their eyes were so complicated that no one could understand the clue.</p>
<p>Finally, the ghost King walked over and said with a smile, &ldquo;how, it&rsquo;s rare for us to meet old friends. Sit down and talk!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as he opened his mouth, the atmosphere was better. GUI Li and Cang song Taoist both moved their eyes and sat down.</p>
<p>The ghost King first said to the ghost: &ldquo;Taoist Cangsong is now the sacrifice of our ghost King clan. In the future, everyone will be the same person. If you have a chance, you should be more close to each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li&rsquo;s eyes flashed and said, &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t the Taoist priest in the ten thousand poison gate? How can he come to the ghost King clan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cangsong Taoist seems to have long expected to be asked this question. His face never changed and he did not speak. Sure enough, the ghost king said with a smile: &ldquo;because great changes have taken place in the ten thousand poison gate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, big change?&rdquo; As soon as this was said, it was not only ghostly, but also two mysterious figures, Youji and Mr. ghost, who were both covered with black veil, were shocked. Nowadays, the evil cult is divided into three parts, and the three sects hold each other in check, and the great change of Wandu sect is naturally a great opportunity for the other two schools.</p>
<p>Youji was the first to ask, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the big change?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost King smiles. &ldquo;Poison God is dead,&rdquo; he said</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; This news is even more astonishing than the ghost King&rsquo;s words just now. GUI Li and other people are people who know the relationship between them, and naturally understand what the death of this person means.</p>
<p>The ghost king looked around and said with a smile, &ldquo;you are not stupid people. You should know that we are facing an opportunity now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A moment&rsquo;s silence.</p>
<p>Seeing the Taoist Cangsong, he said, &ldquo;this news is this Did the Taoist priest bring it? &quot;</p>
<p>The ghost King nodded: &ldquo;yes, and these days I also secretly verify that it is true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li took a deep breath and said, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the situation of Wandu gate now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost King took a look at Cang song. Cang song understood and said, &ldquo;before the poison God died, he left the position of the head of the sect to Qin Wuyan, but his other disciples refused to accept it. Now, the ten thousand poison sect is in a mess. In order to fight for the position of the master of the sect, the great masters in the sect fight against each other endlessly. &quot;</p>
<p>The ghost king said: &ldquo;the chaos is good, the more chaotic, the better. This is the great opportunity for us to unify the holy religion.&rdquo; He stopped for a moment, and then he suddenly said with a sharp smile: &ldquo;speaking of it, you have made a lot of contributions to Qin Wuyan after you severely damaged Qin Wuyan in the dead marsh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li moved in his heart and looked up to the ghost king. Seeing the ghost King&rsquo;s eyes as usual, his eyes twinkled, but he could not see any abnormal look, so he had to be silent.</p>
<p>The ghost king did not say much on this topic. He said: &ldquo;today, I&rsquo;d like you to come here for discussion. The main reason is that Taoist Cangsong has a plan to help our ghost King Zong clean up the gate of ten thousand poisons at one stroke&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everyone was surprised. The ten thousand poison sect was always the first among the three sects of the demon sect. Although the poison God was dead at this time, the hundred footed insects were not stiff. Even if all the strength of guiwangzong is poured out, it is still very difficult to topple the ten thousand poison gate at one stroke. Even if it can be done, I&rsquo;m afraid that I will be greatly damaged. In vain, it&rsquo;s just the Huanhuan faction who stands on the sideline coldly.</p>
<p>GUI Li knew that the ghost king had always been careful and could never fail to see the truth that he could easily understand. For a moment, he was curious about Taoist Cangsong&rsquo;s so-called ingenious plan and said, &ldquo;Oh, there is such a clever plan. I&rsquo;d like to ask for advice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cang song Taoist is not humble. He nods to the ghost king, looks around the crowd and says, &ldquo;you know what the world is afraid of most at present?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When asked, GUI Li and others were stunned. Youji said, &ldquo;naturally, it&rsquo;s those monsters that eat people in southern Xinjiang. Taoist priest, what do you do with these monsters?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost gentleman sitting next to the ghost king was surprised at the beginning. At the moment, he nodded slightly under the black veil and uttered a light voice, as if he had thought of something.</p>
<p>Cangsong Taoist said to you Ji: &ldquo;this strategy is to fall on these monsters. Otherwise, with the strength of the ten thousand poison gate, anyone who wants to swallow it will lose his vitality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the moment, most of the people in the audience understood it, and nodded their heads fiercely: &ldquo;yes, if you can make the ten thousand poison gate and the beast demon fight with each other, it&rsquo;s best, but how can it be done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cangsong Taoist priest chuckled and said: &ldquo;in fact, it&rsquo;s very simple to say that those monsters will kill people when they see people. Moreover, there are many animal demons with sensitive noses and good taste for human flesh, so long as we do&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>His voice was gradually low, and his carefully planned strategy was gradually revealed in front of the public. The time slipped quietly in the public deliberation.</p>
<p>When the secret meeting was over, people did not know how long it had been. The ghost king and Mr. ghost left first. After seeing the ghost, Youji left quietly. Soon, there were only two people left in the room, GUI Li and Cang song Taoist, and they did not immediately get up to leave.</p>
<p>He withdrew his eyes from other places, wandered slowly in the quiet stone chamber, and finally fell back on the face of the man in front of him, only to find that he was looking at him.</p>
<p>Stone chamber, quiet, suddenly, it seems to be able to hear the sound of breathing and heartbeat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you have something to say to me?&rdquo; he said suddenly</p>
<p>Taoist Cangsong gazed at him. After a long time, he said slowly, &ldquo;yes, but I don&rsquo;t know what to say now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a while, he said faintly, &ldquo;have you ever been to Qingyun in the past ten years?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taoist Cangsong&rsquo;s face was indifferent, but his eyes suddenly became complicated. He sighed and said, &ldquo;yes. But it&rsquo;s just a few glances from afar. And you? &quot;</p>
<p>GUI Li stood up slowly, moved the corner of his mouth, and said, &ldquo;I have been there, and the landscape there has not changed much since it was ten years ago. Only people have changed. &quot;</p>
<p>The Taoist Cangsong gave a faint smile, but there was an indescribable bitterness in his smile. He said in a low voice: &ldquo;yes! Only people can change&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>GUI Li turned and walked out. At the moment when he went out, he heard the Taoist Cangsong who was still sitting in his seat behind him. His mouth murmured: &ldquo;Qingyun Qingyun Hey, Qingyun&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>The next moment, he left the stone room, never looking back.</p>
<p>On the bridge above the blood pool, in the strong smell of blood, the king of ghosts and Mr. ghost who came back here looked side by side into the blood. The yellow bird and Kui Niu were still lying in the blood water without any spirit, while the Fulong Ding in the air was slowly turning, emitting red light from time to time.</p>
<p>Ghost King light way: &ldquo;these two spirit beast already almost?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost nodded beside him and said, &ldquo;yes, the spirit and power of huangniao and Kui Niu have been suppressed by Fulong Ding. It seems that the inscription on Fu Long Ding Ding&rsquo;s body about the &ldquo;four spirit blood array&rdquo; is indeed true. &quot;</p>
<p>The ghost King nodded and said, &ldquo;the Fulong Ding is a foreign body in ancient times, and its spiritual power is very important. Even these two spirits have been taken by them. As long as we take the other two spirits, we can achieve great things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost hesitated for a moment and said, &ldquo;Lord, do you think this person is credible about the plan of Taoist Cangsong just now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost King&rsquo;s eyes flash and smile. He said: &ldquo;Cang song is not the Cang pine ten years ago. Although the world is big now, only my holy religion can protect him, and his strategy. But it&rsquo;s just that some ordinary disciples will die. It doesn&rsquo;t matter. &quot;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost moved his black veil and suddenly said, &ldquo;well, I have another idea. Maybe the patriarch can solve the problem of Hehuan sect as well as deal with the Wandu sect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost king was shocked. &ldquo;What?&rdquo; he said? Please teach me this, sir</p>
<p>I dare not, sir. I mean, since the patriarch doesn&rsquo;t care about the death of some ordinary disciples, he just wants to do everything to the end. After leading the animal demons to fight with Wandu gate, the patriarch sent a letter to Mrs. Sanmiao of the Hehuan sect in the name of the ghost king, saying that they were disciples of the holy sect. They could not be saved. Moreover, the animal demons were rampant, and they could kill people if they were right or wrong. In the long run, our holy religion would be in danger. It&rsquo;s better to fight with one of the three schools, or have some chance of winning. &quot;</p>
<p>The ghost King frowned and said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s nice to say, but Madame Sanmiao is also a cunning figure. I&rsquo;m afraid she won&rsquo;t believe it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ghost Mr. indifferent way: &ldquo;just say not do, she naturally does not believe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost king was shocked and said, &ldquo;Sir, you mean&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost said: &ldquo;if more than half of the ghost King&rsquo;s disciples died in the war, and there are dead bodies everywhere, doesn&rsquo;t she believe it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost king was astonished and could not speak for a long time. After a long time, he frowned and said, &ldquo;Sir, you mean to abandon more than half of the disciples of the ghost King clan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost covered his face with black veil and could not see his expression clearly. He only listened to his words. He seemed to have no mood fluctuation when he was talking about the lives of many people. He said, &ldquo;Lord, if you want to achieve great things, why do you care about the lives of these people?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost King couldn&rsquo;t help but struggle. His desire for power and his heart could not bear to fight again and again. The smell of blood in the air seemed to aggravate.</p>
<p>Mr. ghost stood by in silence and waited patiently. For a long time, the ghost King&rsquo;s eyes became more and more bright, and his face seemed to be faintly red, as if the smell of blood in the air penetrated into it. He took a deep breath and suddenly let out a long cry. He said, &ldquo;Sir, what you said is very true. But how can you know that Madame Sanmiao is not falling into the well and eating us in turn?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost gave a sneer and said, &ldquo;Madame Sanmiao is naturally a character who has fallen into the stone. Among the three major sects of the demon sect, which one is really a character who really intercedes with the Taoist priest for the sake of the saints?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost king was stunned, then his eyes brightened and he said, &ldquo;ah! You mean Clever plan, clever plan In addition to his admiration, the ghost King couldn&rsquo;t help clapping his hands and said, &ldquo;Sir, you are indeed a rare genius. He has such wonderful strategies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. GUI said coldly: &ldquo;we are taking these half of the disciples of the ghost King sect as bait. We might as well take the leader to lead us to fight with the beast demon. When the death and injury are almost exhausted, the Huan sect will surely lead a large group of people and horses to kill them. When the time comes, with the master&rsquo;s magic power, we can find a chance to escape quickly in advance Young, and the rest of the matter will be left to the monster to do. In view of the invincible situation of those beasts and demons in these days, it is very difficult for the Huan sect to think that it will not be completely annihilated. &quot;</p>
<p>The ghost King nodded again and again, unable to restrain his joy. However, at this exciting moment, he could still keep calm and suddenly turned around and said, &ldquo;but Sir, since then, our ghost King sect can unify the holy religion, but the holy religion has been greatly damaged. If the beast demon comes back&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost shook his head and said, &ldquo;master, have you forgotten that our holy religion is in the wilderness of Northwest China, and there is still a temple? As long as we unify the holy religion, and then take all the remaining backbone of the ghost King clan to the wilderness, and integrate the holy cult forces there, although the beasts and demons are rampant, they will still be rampant in the middle land for a while, and can not catch up with the wild land. After that, it&rsquo;s time for those decent people here in the Middle Kingdom to use them? &quot;</p>
<p>Finally, the ghost king was completely relieved and sighed, &ldquo;Sir, I am a good teacher and friend from heaven!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost said with a smile: &ldquo;since then, those so-called righteous ways and demon fighting, no matter who wins or loses, must have suffered. Although the beast demons are rampant, I think the power of Qingyun&rsquo;s&rdquo; Zhuxian sword array &ldquo;ten years ago must still be remembered?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost King nodded and said, &ldquo;yes, it&rsquo;s really tight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost said with a smile, &ldquo;so it&rsquo;s not so easy for the demon to win easily. We recuperate in the wilderness. Once the four spirits blood array is successfully cultivated, we will look at the world, and who can resist the sacred power of our religion</p>
<p>The ghost king was stunned and said, &ldquo;why, did Mr. Fei also have news about the other two spirits?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. GUI said: &ldquo;yes, after the Fulong tripod completely took over the divine beast&rdquo; huangniao &ldquo;and the spirit beast&rdquo; Kui Niu &ldquo;, the inscription on the tripod body has reappeared. The next one is the demon beast&rdquo; candle dragon &ldquo;guarding the wild Temple of our holy religion. After we go back to the temple, only the southern evil beast&rdquo; Taotie &ldquo;is left. Then, as long as you find Taotie, the world is not all in your hands! &quot;</p>
<p>The ghost King took a step forward and looked at the blood pool below. The thick smell of blood in the air surrounded him. In a trance, he felt that the world was in his hands.</p>
<p>He couldn&rsquo;t help laughing up to the sky. The laughter was loud and loud, and the smile was so wild! (to be continued. )</p>
