      <p>The red light and shadow twinkled ceaselessly, and the huge space was as bright as day. There was a pungent smell of blood all around. A wide platform road extended from the entrance to the middle of the huge cave. Xiaohui stepped out of the passage carefully and jumped onto the platform. Its weak body looked very small in the huge cave.</p>
<p>Obviously, this is a place that is quite different from other places. Even Xiao Hui, who is active and curious, feels something at the moment. Instead of running forward immediately, he stands still and looks around with three eyes. At the entrance, there is a kind of red tone everywhere. The red shadow in the air flickers. Occasionally, there will be some noise in the silence. However, a strange red wind is passing by. At the foot of Xiaohui, the ground on the platform also shows a strange dark red.</p>
<p>Xiaohui looked around for a long time in situ, then moved forward slowly. In the huge space, only a small figure of Xiaohui was moving. The flashing red light from high places sprinkled down, reflecting its figure, leaving a long shadow behind it.</p>
<p>As he walked along slowly, Xiao Hui turned his head and looked around from time to time, but although the atmosphere here was very strange, there was nothing unusual happening on the way to Xiaohui. Soon, Xiaohui came to the end of the platform. Standing at the end of the platform, the bloody air here is the most intense. Even if it&rsquo;s a little gray, he can&rsquo;t help but feel disgusted on the monkey&rsquo;s face, stretching out his palm and fanning it in front of his nose.</p>
<p>At the end of the platform, in the middle of this huge cave, is a deep pool of blood. Xiaohui slowly walks to the edge of the platform, carefully lies on the rock, and looks down.</p>
<p>In front of it, it was a huge blood pool. The water in the pool was as red as blood, and countless small bubbles constantly came out from the bottom of the blood pool and burst on the water. It gives off a strong smell of blood. But in these blood and water, there are four huge spirit animals, as if they were imprisoned, most of their bodies are immersed in blood and water. It seems that they are weak and tired, and they are still most of the time. Suddenly, Xiao Hui&rsquo;s body seems to be stiff for a while, and the eye in the middle of his forehead. It suddenly lit up.</p>
<p>Among the four spirit beasts, one is a dragon like monster with sharp teeth and fangs. At first glance, it looks like a three point pig, which is a wild &ldquo;candle dragon&rdquo;; the other is a huge one legged, thunder like sound, soaked in blood but still like a hill. It is a &ldquo;Kui Niu&rdquo; in the East China Sea.</p>
<p>The two spirit beasts Xiaohui had never seen before, and after taking a glance at them, they passed away, but the remaining two were the spirit beasts that he had seen before. The yellow bird, which is shaped like a phoenix and has gorgeous plumage, is the spirit animal &ldquo;yellow bird&rdquo; guarding the treasure house of the emperor of heaven in the Western swamp on that day; the last spirit animal, which makes Xiaohui frightened and angry, is the fierce beast &ldquo;Taotie&rdquo; who followed the animal God on that day and made friends with Xiaohui after the animal God died.</p>
<p>The other three spirit beasts were trapped. Anyway, Xiaohui didn&rsquo;t know them very well. Among them, huangniao had some enmity with Xiaohui. Xiaohui saw it like this. Most of them have to jump and clap. However, the friendship between Taotie and Xiaohui is not shallow. Looking at the listless and powerless appearance of Taotie soaked in blood and water, Xiaohui is in a hurry, and &ldquo;zhizhizhi&rdquo; screams at the top of the platform.</p>
<p>This is called. The peace of the blood pool was suddenly broken. The four spirits were all unusual animals. Although they were imprisoned by the weird array here, their aura was almost exhausted, but they still looked up almost at the same time.</p>
<p>Away from the surface of the blood pool, high on the edge of the platform. A monkey appeared and screamed down.</p>
<p>The other three spirit beasts haven&rsquo;t responded, but Taotie recognized Xiaohui at a glance. The giant turned around and roared. However, the roar was only half roared, and then it went down powerlessly. Obviously, Taotie lost nine of his aura and was exhausted.</p>
<p>Seeing Taotie&rsquo;s tragic situation, Xiao Hui was extremely angry. However, he was shocked and angry, but he didn&rsquo;t know what to do. He scratched his ears and scratched his cheek on the platform and was in a hurry. In the blood pool below, it seems that other spirit beasts also see that Xiao Hui behaves differently. It is not like the human beings who cast their magic and array on it. For a time, the wind and thunder roar and the strange &ldquo;hum and roar&rdquo; of candle dragon were heard, and others were imploring.</p>
<p>The four spirit beasts, which were imprisoned by the four spirit blood needles, were originally the most powerful spirit beasts of heaven and earth. They had never put anything in their eyes, let alone were forced to beg like this. Therefore, we can imagine the sinister nature of the four spirits blood array. Even if these animals were left behind in the flood and famine, they could not resist the torture of being soaked in blood by devouring spirits.</p>
<p>Bursts of mourning came, Xiaohui was as anxious as ants on a hot pot. Suddenly, it seemed to have made a sudden decision, stamped its feet, and jumped out of the platform. This move was seen in the eyes of the four spirits below, and there was a sudden commotion. However, the little gray tail kept shaking, and suddenly turned back in the air. It was like being blown by the wind, and landed on the stone pillar under the platform with a sound of &ldquo;pa&rdquo;. Monkey is the best climber. Although the stone pillar is tall, it is still very rough, and there are sudden rock blocks everywhere. Ordinary people are afraid of it. It is the best foothold for monkey Xiaohui.</p>
<p>I saw a small gray figure quickly falling on the stone pillar, tens of Zhang high distance, in a short time, it had climbed down from the platform close to the water surface of the blood pool. The blood was close at hand, and the smell of blood smelled like vomiting. The red water was all around, and bubbles came out from the sleep around, and then burst out with a gentle sound.</p>
<p>The spirit beast nearest to the stone pillar is not Taotie, but a huge kuixiu in the East China Sea. Taotie is in the left front of kuixiu. Xiaohui grabs the stone pillar and looks down. With its cleverness, it naturally doesn&rsquo;t want to touch the terrible and strange blood below.</p>
<p>A moment later, Xiao Hui seemed to see something, his limbs all retracted, and then his feet kicked on the stone pillar. With this momentum, his whole body jumped out. This jump actually jumped half a foot far, just landed on Kui Niu&rsquo;s bleeding belly. Then, with the foot pad, he tried his best to jump. The gray figure passed a smooth track on the blood surface Good fall on the top of Taotie&rsquo;s only surface.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cheep, cheep, cheep&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as he fell on Taotie, Xiao Hui immediately called out, and at the same time, his hands were groping around his bare skin on Taotie&rsquo;s head, as if he were extremely concerned. He wanted to see what kind of damage his old friend had suffered. In the past, the ferocious gluttonous food in the past can be seen now. It seems to be very pleased with the arrival of Xiaohui, and he makes a low roar in his mouth, while his head slowly rotates.</p>
<p>Around them, the other three spirit beasts immersed in the blood pool were silent at the moment. No longer to make a sound, just silently watching Taotie and Xiaohui here.</p>
<p>Xiao Hui groped for a while on the hard skin of Taotie&rsquo;s head, and stopped. He seemed to be confused. He couldn&rsquo;t figure out the surrounding situation for a moment.</p>
<p>Squatting on the top of Taotie&rsquo;s head, Xiaohui grabs his head. Unexpectedly, Xiaohui seems to be careless for a moment. He looks at Taotie as if he is not as good as Kui Niu. Only his head is exposed, and there is not much room left for him to stand. When he relaxes a little, he accidentally falls into the surrounding blood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Squeak, squeak&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seems that the ash was suddenly scalded by boiling water. Suddenly jumped up, and several other spirit beasts around him were also in a commotion, and the Taotie at Xiaohui&rsquo;s feet was also startled. However, it held Xiaohui&rsquo;s head and did not dare to move. For fear that it would move too violently, it would lift the small ash into the blood water, which was worth 2 low roars. At the same time, two copper bell big eyes rolled up to see Xiaohui to the end What happened? It looks like a person rolling his eyes. It&rsquo;s very funny.</p>
<p>Xiao Hui grabbed his tail and put it in front of him. He saw the short tail touching blood. Although it was not fleshy, it was a bit anxious. However, it seemed to be burned by the fire. It stayed for a while, then he puffed up his gills and blew hard at his tail. I don&rsquo;t know if it can reduce the pain slightly.</p>
<p>Then. Xiaohui loosened his tail, stood carefully, and then patted Taotie&rsquo;s head, indicating that he was no different. Taotie was quiet, and the other three spirit beasts around him were calm.</p>
<p>Just a moment later, Xiao Hui&rsquo;s eyes glanced over Taotie and the other three spirit beasts. Seeing that they were all powerless and confined in the pool of blood and water, his eyes were filled with anger. Just now the monkey&rsquo;s tail only touched the blood. The four spirit beasts were immersed in the blood pool all day long, and their suffering was unimaginable.</p>
<p>Xiaohui&rsquo;s anger in his eyes became more and more fierce. He suddenly jumped up on Taotie&rsquo;s head and called &ldquo;creaky&rdquo; in his mouth. At the same time, he reached out to pull Taotie, as if he wanted to pull it out of the blood. Looking at Xiaohui&rsquo;s movements, the other three spirit beasts are crying again. At the same time, Taotie doesn&rsquo;t stand up with Xiaohui&rsquo;s pulling. On the contrary, its huge head is slowly shaking.</p>
<p>Xiaohui stayed for a while and squeaked twice, seemingly puzzled.</p>
<p>At this moment, there was a low thunder in front of me, but it was from Kui Niu.</p>
<p>Xiaohui, Taotie and other two spirit beasts, candlelong and huangniao, looked at the past at the same time. It seemed that Kui Niu was trying to explain something. After a low roar, the whole huge body was shaking slowly. Judging from its appearance, it had the meaning of standing up.</p>
<p>The other several spirit beasts are staring at Kui Niu. Kui Niu is the largest among the four spirit beasts, and seems to have the best physical strength. Just after struggling for a while, the body is about to kneel and stand up. Suddenly, four dark red columns of light appear from the top of the blood pool where they are, just like substance, and immediately cover the four spirit beasts in dark red The light is hard. However, Kui Niu&rsquo;s huge body, which had been struggling for a long time, seemed to lose its strength. For example, the hill was toppled over, and the doctor fell into the blood again. The blood splashed everywhere, and there was a bit of desolation in the desolation. The other spirits covered by the dark red light column also showed the color of pain. Xiaohui stood on the top of Taotie&rsquo;s head. Under the dark red light column, it naturally covered it. But for some reason, probably because there was no prohibition on Xiaohui, Xiaohui found that he was no different after being frightened.</p>
<p>Four beams of light shot down from the sky above, and soon after they were covered with the four spirit beasts, in the flickering of dark red light, wisps of white aura were absorbed from several spirit beasts and floated up quietly.</p>
<p>Seeing this situation, Xiaohui naturally understood everything. He suddenly raised his head and opened his eyes. Especially the golden eye in the middle of his forehead, the light flashed and the brilliance flowed. From the bottom up, the dark red light column shrouded in the four spirit beasts slowly changed from thick to thin, and gradually increased. Finally, it was launched from a strange tripod suspended in the void more than ten feet higher than the platform in mid air.</p>
<p>Xiao Hui stares at the strange tripod tightly and suddenly makes a scream. With one kick of both feet, the body has left the head of Taotie and jumped straight to Kui Niu. Several other spirit beasts stare at Xiaohui one after another, only to see Xiaohui sliding in the air. However, the body has become abnormal, and the golden eyes between the forehead are full of golden light, which radiates dazzling light, and the inside of the body is even more &ldquo;clucking and clucking&rdquo; violent sound, as if the bones were shaking.</p>
<p>The distance is more than ten meters.</p>
<p>When Xiaohui leaped over and landed on Kui Niu&rsquo;s huge body, its body was covered with a layer of golden brilliance. Its body was more than twice as big as usual. But this was not the end. Little ash hardly stayed on Kui Niu. In the roar, it jumped again and again, and the body jumped into the air again. This time, it was towards the stone pillar.</p>
<p>And this time in mid air. Xiaohui&rsquo;s body is regenerated and changed. From the golden light, a strange red awn suddenly emerges, interwoven with the golden light. The sound of &ldquo;boom&rdquo; is like thunder and wind howling, and the body of three eyed monkey rises like a legend. It has become a Giant Monkey more than ten feet tall. Its eyes are red as blood, and its mouth has sharp fangs. It is majestic and full of evil spirit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poof!&rdquo; With a loud noise, the small ash which had already incarnated as a giant beast fell on the stone pillar, and the whole huge stone pillar was shaking. At the same time, Xiao Hui is not hesitant. Roar constantly, climb up quickly.</p>
<p>The stone pillar, which is tens of feet high, is just a short distance between the hands and feet of the Giant Monkey. In a short time, the huge body of Xiaohui has turned over the platform and landed on the ground. Looking up at the Dragon tripod suspended in the air, the Giant Monkey beat his chest with his hands and raised his head and cried out: &ldquo;roar!&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sound was amazing. With a roar, there was a sense of change in color. The silence in the huge cave was finally completely broken. The roar spread far away, and the dark red light and shadow trembled in the air, and the aperture on the Fulong tripod also shook. Then the Red Mansions, which seemed to have spirituality, slowly turned around.</p>
<p>In the face of this strange array and unknown things, Xiao Hui bares his teeth and looks fierce. After a moment, he suddenly puts his feet on the ground. In an instant, the huge monkey rises in the air. At a distance of more than ten feet, the Giant Monkey flies up with a terrible voice. The red shadow disappears in the middle of the journey, and he is about to hit the Fulong Ding.</p>
<p>However, the four spirit blood array is very important. When Xiaohui was about to rush up the Fulong Ding, a layer of red light mask appeared around. Xiaohui&rsquo;s huge body hit the mask. Such a huge force was invisible, and it could not be moved in and fell back.</p>
<p>And then, the four spirit blood array has begun to fight back.</p>
<p>In mid air, countless dark red lights and shadows gathered one after another. From a distance, Fulong Ding looks like a strange red sun, surrounded by thousands of Red Mansions, forming a huge light curtain.</p>
<p>On the light screen, hundreds of red bumps gradually appeared, each three feet square. A moment later, the sound of &ldquo;boom&rdquo; filled the whole cave. The hundreds of red bulges burst together, shooting out strange and terrifying round objects like blood bubbles. They fell from the sky like rain, and shot at the bodies of small ashes like a storm.</p>
<p>Xiao Hui roared up to the sky and roared like thunder. The golden red light of his whole body became more and more intense. As soon as he landed, he turned over and turned over. He was as flexible as if he had no weight at all. The strange objects shot from the mid air hit the platform ground one after another, which instantly eroded the hard rock ground into big holes and made a &ldquo;silk&rdquo; strange sound, which was breathtaking.</p>
<p>The storm like attack just passed. Before the little ash could breathe back, the terrible light curtain in the air changed again. On the huge red light screen, dozens of bulges were raised again. But this time, each one was half a foot in size and the speed was extremely fast. Before the small ash reacted, those huge heart bulges burst again. What burst out of them was not the round corrosion monster They were all bloody skeletons, holding swords, spraying venom, and other monsters, such as fire and freezing. All of them roared down from the air and jumped at the ash with their teeth and claws.</p>
<p>These horrible scenes are as terrible as hell. In the huge cavern, the wind is howling and the blood in the blood pool is boiling. The four spirit beasts seem to be very angry. They all look up and roar.</p>
<p>On the platform, dozens of huge skeletons swooped down together, but Xiaohui didn&rsquo;t retreat from the scene. He punched his hands in his chest and yelled loudly. Instead of retreating, he went forward. It was the skeleton group that was rushing towards the front, turned into a huge gray shadow and rushed into the blood red array in an instant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roar&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A huge hissing sound like thunder. Tearing the world apart, Xiaohui rushes into the skeletons, rushes to the left and kills the right, and the giant hand dances wildly. At that time, he beat several skeletons in front of him and flew out. As soon as a skeleton in front of him was about to chop it with a knife, Xiaohui punched him with a fist, and then he cut the blade on top of the skull, and flew up again. The &ldquo;Dong&rdquo; sound kicked the skeleton a long way, flew straight out of the platform and fell into the blood pool.</p>
<p>The surrounding skeletons roared and surrounded one after another. It seemed that they didn&rsquo;t know how to be afraid. All kinds of vicious moves rushed at Xiaohui from all directions. But in a moment, the gray hair on Xiaohui&rsquo;s body had been burned out for five or six wounds, and some of them were blackened in an instant. It&rsquo;s obviously poisonous. Under the severe pain, the Giant Monkey seems to be ferocious. He turns around and hits him with one hand, like thunder and lightning. The huge wind blows through. Under the roar, Shengsheng knocks the heads of the three skeletons to the ground, and turns around several times. The rest of the headless body rushes forward a few steps. Just fell down.</p>
<p>In this round, Xiaohui is extremely fierce, and has already discarded half of the dozens of skeletons, but there are also many places to hang colors on his body. But these wounds seemed to stimulate Xiao Hui&rsquo;s ferocity, and his eyes between his forehead were full of blood. He roared and rushed at the remaining skeletons.</p>
<p>Those skeletons rushed forward fearlessly, and Xiaohui rushed into the array, and raised his feet to kick a skeleton next to him. Then the back suddenly didn&rsquo;t hurt. A skeleton with a big knife in his back yelled and cut the knife deep into Xiaohui&rsquo;s back. Xiao Hui yelled and turned around abruptly. The blood splashed all over his back. The skeleton seemed to be stunned for a moment. He didn&rsquo;t respond for a moment. Xiaohui grabbed the skeleton with his hand and threw it far away in a roar, Life smashed on the hard wall of the cave in the distance.</p>
<p>There was no time to look at the results of the battle. Xiaohui&rsquo;s eyes were even more fierce. He turned back and rushed. A skeleton was stabbed by a long gun. Xiaohui didn&rsquo;t look. He grabbed the spear in his hand and pulled it over. Unexpectedly, the skeleton was also fierce. He held the spear and didn&rsquo;t let it go. The whole body was brought over and wanted to stab Xiaohui in the air.</p>
<p>Xiaohui is even more angry. He grabs the spear and suddenly stretches out of his head. He whirls away like a windmill. &ldquo;Wuwuwu&rdquo; sounds suddenly. The skeleton is turned into a huge blade in Xiaohui&rsquo;s hands by the spear. At the same time, more than a dozen skeletons nearby are shot to fly out. Although the platform is spacious, it is almost round for Xiaohui and the huge bodies of these skeletons The table is no different, this suddenly fell out of the platform, fell to the blood pool.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poop, poop, thump&rdquo;, the sound was continuous. Dozens of skeletons fell into the blood pool, and most of them were still struggling. It seemed that they still had to complete their mission, and then returned to the platform to fight the fierce monkey.</p>
<p>However, before they could stop in the blood pool, suddenly several huge body shadows appeared in front of them. At the moment, the four spirit blood array was busy fighting with the small gray, and the dark red light shield of the four spirit beasts had been removed. Although these spirit beasts had been empty for a long time, how could they be ordinary people</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pa Pa Pa Pa Pa Pa Pa Pa Pa&rdquo;, the sound is endless. Although the four big spirit beasts can&rsquo;t look at each other like before, their huge bodies are still there. They lean directly against it, turn around and crush more than a dozen skeletons</p>
<p>These days, these animals have been bullied, and their anger is very important. They have been pressed and pressed for seven or eight times, panting for breath. It seems that they have not yet cleared their hatred</p>
<p>Fortunately, one or two places where they fell were relatively remote, and the skeletons escaped from being crushed. They were about to paddle away, but they suddenly turned their heads and opened their mouths one by one. They were actually directly biting them and swallowing them alive.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the blood pool, several spirit beasts spit out evil gas, and the fierce battle on the high platform continues. A dozen skeletons are beaten down, and only three or four skeletons are left on the platform, chopping away at the ash. However, for Xiao Hui, these are more than words. He threw himself on the body, smashed and kicked around, and then several were discarded. Only one skeleton still rushed forward. Xiao Hui was so fierce that he didn&rsquo;t look at the knife he had cut. He roared at him and knocked down the skeleton with one hand, opened his mouth and bit it on the skull. His sharp fangs also stabbed him in the past</p>
<p>The skeleton shook twice, and then broke away. Xiaohui stood up and looked around, very proud. The four spirits blood array in the air seemed to have no idea that Xiaohui was so strong and had a pause for a moment, but then the red light curtain lit up again. This time, the light was restrained. The red light on the Fulong tripod flowed slowly, and the devil&rsquo;s face on the ancient tripod suddenly twinkled. It is hard to express the ferocity of it.</p>
<p>However, although the Fulong Ding is fierce and violent, it seems that the lock of heaven and earth tightly nailed to the devil&rsquo;s face like a light dagger is not moved by it at all. Let the red light on the Fulong tripod impact several times. Still like a nail in the devil&rsquo;s forehead, so that the surrounding blood can not gather.</p>
<p>When the blood of the Fulong tripod returned to attack, the atmosphere of the battle just now appeared. Xiao Hui&rsquo;s huge body stood on the platform and roared at the Dragon tripod suspended in mid air. Fu Ding, it seems that there is no response from Fu Ding.</p>
<p>Xiaohui looks at it for a while. Her golden eyes twinkle. Suddenly, she feels like she sees something. She shouts. She grabs a skeleton which is broken on the ground beside her and throws it to the Fulong Ding in mid air.</p>
<p>As soon as the skeleton arrived around the Fulong Ding, it was still the same as the previous small ash impact. Being blocked by a layer of red light shield, Xiaohui roars on the ground, picks up the broken bones scattered by his hand, and continuously throws them to the Fulong Ding.</p>
<p>The sound of breaking through the sky is endless, and the sound is more and more sharp. How powerful is Xiaohui&rsquo;s strength after transforming at the moment. Although the mask of Fulong tripod in mid air is well guarded, somehow, it seems that most of the spirit power of the Fulong tripod has been restrained to deal with the small light column, and the outer light mask still remains motionless at the beginning. Later, it was shaking.</p>
<p>Standing at the bottom of the small ash to see real, suddenly doubled confidence, strange roar repeatedly, suddenly broken bones such as rain. All of a sudden, Xiao Hui&rsquo;s three eyes lit up, and he stretched out his hand on the ground to fight wildly. All of a sudden, Xiaohui didn&rsquo;t hesitate. On the spot, they snatched those large pieces of gravel and threw them to the Dragon tripod again.</p>
<p>The stone is hard, far better than those skeletons and broken bones. Just now the bone breaking attack turned into a storm of gravel at the moment, and its strength increased by three points. Moreover, the ammunition was endless, surging and roaring like a storm. At the same time, the stable light shield was in chaos at the moment, and finally, after a crisp sound, the red light shield faded away, The real body of Fulong Ding is revealed.</p>
<p>Standing on the platform, Xiao Hui saw it vividly. With a roar of excitement, even the four spirit beasts in the blood pool were excited and roared.</p>
<p>Xiaohui didn&rsquo;t hesitate. He grabbed the biggest piece of boulder beside him. It was the size of a man. He yelled and threw it to the Fulong Ding.</p>
<p>The stone was as fast as lightning, and it was extremely powerful. On the way, it was not covered by the light shield. After a moment, it finally hit the body of the Fulong Ding Ding, making a dull sound of &ldquo;Dong&rdquo;</p>
<p>The body of the Fulong Ding Ding Ding was shaken, and the red mounton on it was in chaos. The blood gathered around the devil&rsquo;s face also flowed back. The ancient tripod, which had been stably suspended in the air, was finally hit by the small ash, which was tilted a little bit and disordered its position.</p>
<p>However, perhaps because of this, the red awns on the Fulong tripod all lit up in an instant, and the whole ancient tripod almost turned red. A huge and strange mysterious force finally reappeared. As if echoing with it, the heaven and earth lock light dagger on the Fulong tripod suddenly showed its light.</p>
<p>The strong smell of blood spread all over the world in an instant, and the whole huge cave began to vibrate. There were huge stones falling in the cracks on the four sides of the stone walls, such as the devil waking up, the blood rose violently, staring at the rampant Giant Monkey from the air.</p>
<p>The shock changed from a smile to a violent force, which shocked the whole Huqi mountain range. Far from the blood pool, the ghost King cave was once again enveloped by a desperate fear. In the ghost King&rsquo;s stone chamber, GUI Li and Mr. GUI suddenly raised their heads. The unprecedented strong blood gas even filled their stone room. The ground was shaking violently. After their initial astonishment, the astrolabe in front of them, like a sudden summoned by some mysterious force, finally changed again.</p>
<p>All the ancient jade pieces on the astrolabe were lit up in an instant. The soft white light was so bright that people could not see it in a twinkling of an eye. However, the speed of the small jade blocks sliding on one side was more than ten times faster than that of a sudden. It seemed that the fate of the days had changed dramatically in an instant.</p>
<p>Further away, in the ice chamber, the violent earthquake and the debris falling from the surrounding stone walls were also better than before.</p>
<p>In this scene like the end of the world, the ghost King slowly stood up, his face appeared strange expression, like ecstasy, like excitement, like fierce, like * *, his voice also turned to be low and hoarse, reverberating in the empty stone room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this day finally coming&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the top of Huqi mountain, Xiaobai&rsquo;s figure standing in the wind also suddenly shook, and there were bursts of tremor from the bottom of her feet. She didn&rsquo;t feel wrong. It was the whole Huqi mountain range shaking, which had never happened in thousands of years. Today, it happened.</p>
<p>A sneering smile flashed over her cold face. Suddenly, she lifted her clothes, and her white shadow fluttered. But she swept down the mountain. Looking at that direction, it was the entrance of the cave of ghost king. (to be continued. )</p>
