<p>Until a month later, the wind was so tight that even the old lady in Zhang&rsquo;s mouth and Xu Meixiang, the palm of ziding mountain, had heard something about it. Bai Xiaochun and Zhang daphou had to give up and stay in ziding mountain. Under Zhang&rsquo;s agenda, they decided to rescue black sanniu.</p>
<p>So they went to Qingfeng mountain.</p>
<p>Black sanniu has also lost some weight. Although it is not obvious, she also shows her graceful posture, which makes Bai Xiaochun and Zhang Da Pang stay for a while, and they can hardly recognize her. Even her once black face, now it looks like some moving charm. It can be imagined that if she finally loses her weight, she must be a beautiful woman.</p>
<p>Just, a listen to the spirit tail chicken, black three Niu&rsquo;s eyes suddenly bright.</p>
<p>From then on, the Lingwei chicken of Qingfeng mountain began to be lost</p>
<p>At this moment, the name of &ldquo;chicken stealing maniac&rdquo; has become a complete success on the south bank, causing a sensation in all directions. Almost no one in the outside school knows about it, even the servants have heard about it.</p>
<p>Fortunately, it didn&rsquo;t last too long. When some elders began to pay attention to it, the chicken stealing maniac suddenly disappeared and no longer appeared. However, both black sanniu and Zhang daphou recovered obviously. Although they were far from being able to return to their former power, they were all too strong.</p>
<p>And Bai Xiaochun here, finally After the 9981 day cycle, the hunger was no longer so strong, so the three gave up stealing chickens.</p>
<p>Although the 81 cycles of the immortal longevity work are not completed continuously, but accumulated, the effects are the same and there is no difference.</p>
<p>On this day, Bai Xiaochun looked dignified in the courtyard of Xiangyun mountain, and his whole body skin exuded iron color and black light. A strong breath came from his skin, which turned into a sense of wildness.</p>
<p>At this moment, the pain of 9981 days, together with the hunger of 9981 days, formed an amazing force, which continued to explode in Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p>Each outbreak contains countless vitality. All of these elements melt into Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s skin with the explosion, which makes his skin more iron colored, black and dazzling, and the degree of tenacity is also doubled.</p>
<p>Even if he stood there, if anyone saw it, he would think it was an iron man, not a real man.</p>
<p>His mind roared ceaselessly, this kind of explosion had appeared 19 times in his body, but there was no sign of stopping, but the impact was faster.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun didn&rsquo;t move, as if he didn&rsquo;t even breathe. When he looked carefully, he could see that his whole body&rsquo;s hair was closing slightly, and the forces of heaven and earth around him were quietly gathering together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After the outbreak of 9981 times, if I have to live without death, I will become a small success and enter the realm of iron sheet!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s pithy formula of immortality and longevity comes into his mind. His face is firm and resolute. All his efforts in the past year, whether it&rsquo;s pain or hunger, is for It was the explosion of this moment.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The vitality of the body again impact, his skin iron color more, the vitality drill into every inch of skin, such as forging.</p>
<p>At this moment, he is like a magic weapon, and the explosion is the hammer again and again, boom!</p>
<p>Twenty, thirty, forty, forty-eight</p>
<p>As time went by, three days later, Bai Xiaochun was still standing there. There was no sound outside, but he could hear the endless thunder like sound coming from his body.</p>
<p>But at this time, after the 49th burst of vitality in his body, suddenly, the force of the impact suddenly doubled. His body trembled, and some fine cracks appeared on his skin visible to the naked eye, as if unable to support it.</p>
<p>Although these cracks are not many, but after they appear, they let Bai Xiaochun sink in his heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As expected, the appearance of extinction Bai Xiaochun frowned. In the immortal longevity work, there is an introduction to the present state. He once said that in the process of Xiaocheng, immortality skin is bound to appear such fragmentation. However, according to different people&rsquo;s will, the longer we persist, the better the effect of immortal skin will be in the future.</p>
<p>Even if it is not to adhere to, the skin will be repaired, but in the effect, the more perfect the better.</p>
<p>If we can stick to the complete eighty-one burst of vitality, it is really perfect.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s eyes showed firmness and closed his eyes again. The roar in his body spread all over his body, 50 times, 60 times, 70 times In the next five days, he insisted on more than 70 times.</p>
<p>His skin at the moment, such as turtle lines as dense spread throughout the body, and even many places are connected together, like a broken and sticky vase.</p>
<p>It seems that it can be split at any time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only seven times short!&rdquo; In Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s eyes, there is blood in his eyes. He is short of breath, and he bites his teeth fiercely. The cruelty of his character suddenly breeds.</p>
<p>Seventy four times!</p>
<p>Seventy seven times!</p>
<p>Seventy nine times!</p>
<p>When Bai Xiaochun roared to the sky, the roar was not loud. It was more stuffy. When his body was shaking, he survived a burst of vitality in his body again, reaching 80 times.</p>
<p>The vitality quickly integrated into his skin, so that although the whole skin cracked, but as iron, people can see, will be shocking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One last time!&rdquo; In front of me, I don&rsquo;t want to give up the fist, but I don&rsquo;t want to give up the next time.</p>
<p>With a bang, when a pit appeared, the last burst of vitality in his body finally came to an end. Countless vitality melted into his skin. Visible to the naked eye, the cracks in his whole body disappeared in a blink of an eye. When it was smooth, even the black awn was scattered, and it still looked white and clean. But no one knew that on this seemingly ordinary skin, it had amazing tenacity 。</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun was short of breath. When he looked up for a long time, he looked at the big hole which was opened by himself on the ground and looked at his skin. He was immediately excited and laughed.</p>
<p>With a wave of his right hand, the wooden sword flew out and turned into a black light and ran straight to his arm. At the moment of touching, the sound of gold and iron came out. When the sound was heard, the wooden sword was shaken back directly. However, the skin of his arm just felt as if he had been bitten by a mosquito. After a careful look, he did not get any injuries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Immortal skin!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun can&rsquo;t help but be overjoyed. To know that this wooden sword is not an ordinary magic weapon, but two times of soul refining. Although its material is ordinary, its power after refining is comparable to Tianjiao&rsquo;s magic weapon, but even so, it still can&rsquo;t hurt him at all.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s body shook and burst out with all his strength. There was a hum in the air around him. When he appeared, he was more than ten Zhang away. This speed was more than several times faster than before, which made Bai Xiaochun more delicate.</p>
<p>As for the fact that he had no difference in the strength of his heart, he had no difference in the appearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such a protective force can protect the road of Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s long life.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun is very proud of himself. After looking at his accomplishments, he has made a lot of progress. He has reached the great perfection of the fourth layer of condensate gas.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not the ordinary four layers of condensate, but after the internal aura is compressed, it can be said that the quality of his aura itself is no longer comparable to that of monks in the same realm.</p>
<p>He was so satisfied that he galloped back and forth in the courtyard. A moment later, his body gave a sudden thump. When his eyes showed a touch of fine light, his right hand was raised, his thumb and index finger formed a half mouth shape, and he pinched it hard. At the same time, his two fingers were shining with black light. It was clear that there was nothing in front of him, but there was nothing in front of him, but under this pinch, the nihility in front of him would creak.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s eyes shrunk, turned and swayed to a rock. Once again, the black light of his right hand twinkled. When he pinched it, he cracked it like tofu.</p>
<p>Once again, he appeared next to Lingdong bamboo, where the bamboo had grown to more than three feet high. He chose the hardest bamboo head. As soon as he pinched it, the bamboo head cracked like a bang.</p>
<p>In this scene, let Bai Xiaochun take a breath. When his body falls down, he looks down at his double fingers and the black awn on it slowly dissipates. For a long time, he breathes out his long breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this the broken throat lock&hellip;&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun murmured. This is a secret method in immortal longevity. Only Xiaocheng of undead skin can be used. It is said that it can produce twice the power and be invincible.</p>
<p>Just now, Bai Xiaochun only used 50% of his strength. He couldn&rsquo;t imagine how terrible it would be if he tried his best to use this secret method.</p>
<p>In Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s opinion, this kind of secret method is a kind of killing secret method. He was silent for a moment. Although he thought it was ferocious, he practiced it seriously. In this yard, his figure swam quickly, and sometimes his black fingers were shining, which was the sound of sound.</p>
<p>As time went by, half a month passed. During this half month, Bai Xiaochun did not go out of the yard. She was practicing all the time. Naturally, she did not know that Li Qinghou, who had been away for several months, walked a green rainbow to return to lingxizong and the top of Xiangyun mountain.</p>
<p>Before he could wait for a rest after he returned, two Changhong came from Qingfeng mountain and ziding mountain, and went straight to the top of the mountain to look for Li Qinghou. It could be seen that one of the two changhongs was an old man. His body was like a sharp sword without leaving the body, and the whole person exuded the unique prestige of the building foundation monk.</p>
<p>In the other rainbow, there is a wonderful woman. She seems to be born to be a coquettish girl with a beautiful appearance. But now, with a strange look on her face, she reaches the top of the mountain with the old man.</p>
<p>These two are the palms of Qingfeng mountain and ziding mountain. On the top of Xiangyun mountain, they have a private conversation with Li Qinghou, and then they leave.</p>
<p>At the top of Xiangyun mountain, Li Qinghou kneaded his eyebrows and sat there. He focused on the three places where Lingwei chickens were kept. When he found that there were only chicks left, he looked like he couldn&rsquo;t laugh or cry. He sighed and swung his sleeves. He walked out of the hall and walked down the mountain road to see the direction</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the courtyard where Bai Xiaochun lives.</p>
