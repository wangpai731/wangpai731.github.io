      <p>With enough spirit stones, Bai Xiaochun doesn&rsquo;t want to think about the little turtle any more. His heart is full of wounds, so he can only be immersed in the medicine refining pavilion to recover slowly.</p>
<p>Gradually, the second-order elixir in Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s hands has been perfect, and the success rate has been raised to an amazing level. Only then did he begin to try to refine the third-order elixir.</p>
<p>As he refined the third-order elixir, the roar was heard from time to time in the room of the medicine refining Pavilion. At one time, he didn&rsquo;t know why. The furnace was blown up and fell to one side.</p>
<p>It was nothing, but until one time, a smoke burst out. The smoke was so strange that even the array could not be stopped. It covered most of the medicine refining Pavilion in a flash, which made many people who were refining medicine in this place, one by one, coughing and cursing, and ran out one after another.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun was surprised and ran out. At last, they didn&rsquo;t find out who was the culprit.</p>
<p>After hesitating for a moment, Bai Xiaochun carefully continued to refine the third level elixir. Slowly, he looked strange. He found that he always refined some strange miracles. It seems that this sign appeared from the earliest alchemy. At that time, countless ants came, and the oestrus pill</p>
<p>He vaguely felt that he was afraid of the strange Dan he had refined.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it because I don&rsquo;t want to use a fixed prescription to refine medicine. Every time I refine medicine, I always want to change it according to my own mind? Or is it because I&rsquo;m so gifted that even God is jealous of me, I&rsquo;m making all sorts of difficulties with me? &quot; At the moment, Bai Xiaochun looks at the dozens of colorful pills in front of her, with a sad face.</p>
<p>Some of these pills are still round, some are square, and some are irregularly pinched together like mud. They are not normal miracles at first sight, but each of them has a fragrance of medicine</p>
<p>Just give Bai Xiaochun 100 courage, he also dare not go to swallow personally, ghost knows these Dan medicine can appear what fantastic effect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I pursue is the ultimate way of medicine, just like the white clouds in the sky, ethereal and traceless, indifferent to fame and wealth, and in the pursuit of the path of medicine, it must be bumpy, I am not afraid of ups and downs, to firmly go on, this is me, not the same white Xiaochun.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun took a deep breath, and slowly showed a persistent, martyr like look on his face. He put away these pills and continued to refine them.</p>
<p>The refining lasted for half a year. At the end of the day, there were few people in the medicine refining Pavilion who could continue to refine medicine. It was too dangerous here. Even the furnace in Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s room split a gap in a blast. Bai Xiaochun made compensation for some spirit stones and was politely invited out of the refining medicine Pavilion.</p>
<p>He was trying to put forward the identity of the leader&rsquo;s younger brother to theory, but found that there was a message from Zhang daphou in the jade slips, saying that he had gone outside Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s residence.</p>
<p>When Bai Xiaochun saw that Zhang daphou was coming, he let go of the refining medicine Pavilion and walked on the path of Xiangyun mountain. He was filled with emotion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pursuit of the ultimate medicine is doomed to be bumpy. I am a white cloud in the sky, and I will never yield to it!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun raised his head and walked. He found something wrong. It was noon. On weekdays, at this time, the clan was the busiest. But now Xiangyun mountain was much quieter. Looking at it, there were no disciples above the sixth floor of condensate gas, and most of them were below the sixth floor of condensate gas.</p>
<p>When Bai Xiaochun returned to the house in surprise, he saw a tall and thin young man walking around his house from a distance, as if excited.</p>
<p>This person is Zhang Da fat after thin down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Big brother.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun ran over and yelled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ninth younger martial brother!&rdquo; Zhang daphou immediately turns around and laughs when he sees Bai Xiaochun. Zhang daphou doesn&rsquo;t care about the identity of Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s younger martial brother. In his eyes, Bai Xiaochun is his younger martial brother.</p>
<p>At the moment, Bai Xiaochun is brought into the house. They sit in the courtyard and talk to each other about the latest situation. Bai Xiaochun opens his mouth curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elder martial brother, you seldom come to my place. How did you come here today? If there is anything I need to do by Bai Xiaochun, you can say it.&rdquo; For Zhang daphou, Bai Xiaochun really regards him as his brother. When he recalls the scenes in the kitchen, Bai Xiaochun is very warm.</p>
<p>Zhang daphou coughed dry. He could not hide his pride and excitement. He took a look at Bai Xiaochun. He patted his chest. Although the slapping sound of fat meat in the fire stove room turned into the banging sound of bone, the momentum suddenly rose in this moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nine younger martial brother, tell you a big secret!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Bai Xiaochun heard the word &ldquo;secret&rdquo;, she immediately opened her eyes and quickly listened. She felt that this sentence was a little familiar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the future, I, Zhang Da Pang, will be famous in Lingxi sect. No one knows, and even many disciples will come to flatter me. Maybe even the elder who built the foundation will be polite to me.&rdquo; Zhang daphou spoke with pride.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah? What&rsquo;s going on? Are you a little turtle, too? &quot; Bai Xiaochun is stunned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What little tortoise, Ninth younger martial brother, do you know that my master is Xu Meixiang, the palm of ziding mountain?&rdquo; Zhang daphou is in high spirits. He looks at Bai Xiaochun. After taking a deep breath, he opens his mouth in a deep voice.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun nodded his head. He knew and understood that Zhang daphou had become thinner because his master didn&rsquo;t like fat people. Even so, he had some strange ideas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know what my master is good at? Refining! Know what I learned from my master? Refining</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha ha, I have a unique talent for refining spirit. Even my master praised and even surprised me for my talent! She told me today that in a few years, I will become the first master of Lingxi sect Zhang daphou stood up and looked up at the sky excitedly. His momentum broke out as if he was the only one in the world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alchemy?&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun blinked and saw Zhang daphou&rsquo;s majestic appearance at the moment. He quickly put on a worship look and exclaimed.</p>
<p>Perceiving Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s cooperation, Zhang daphou is more happy and pats Bai Xiaochun on the shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ninth younger martial brother, I don&rsquo;t want to be tempered by others in the future. If I don&rsquo;t like it, I don&rsquo;t want it. But you and sanpang, as well as the other people in the fire stove, I don&rsquo;t want you to have a spirit stone in my life. As long as you prepare all the materials, I&rsquo;ll refine them for you!&rdquo; Zhang daphou is full of energy. In these days, since he entered the purple tripod mountain, he has always repressed his distress. Now he finds that he has the talent of soul refining. He is ecstatic at once. The first thing he thinks of is to come to Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elder martial brother, you are very powerful!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun showed the appearance of ecstasy and cheered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come and come, you can bring me an item at will. Elder martial brother will refine it for you in front of you. If you hold this weapon, you will be ranked among the top ten in the South Bank of China in the qualification war a few months later, representing the Tianjiao battle between the south bank and the north bank!&rdquo; Zhang daphou was happy and said out loud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Er&hellip;&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun blinked and saw that Zhang daphou was so excited. So he simply took out a common flying sword of Lingxi clan from his storage bag. He had several such swords, which he handed over with expectation.</p>
<p>Zhang daphou took the flying sword, took a deep breath and patted the storage bag. Dozens of pieces of ore flew out of the bag. He manipulated it and floated with the flying sword.</p>
<p>His eyes closed, and a moment later, his whole body cultivation erupted. Although his accomplishments were not as good as Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s, he also appeared to be full of six layers of condensation gas. At the moment, his hair was flying, and Bai Xiaochun immediately saw Zhang&rsquo;s left hand and sent out a strong silver light at this moment.</p>
<p>When the light was shining, there was a strong wind all around, which seemed to change the aura fluctuation around. There was a trace of aura rushing from all around. It went straight to the ores, which flew out like filtration, and rushed to Zhang Dafu&rsquo;s left hand. Those ores also melted rapidly, and in a blink of an eye, they were less than half.</p>
<p>It was the first time that he saw other people&rsquo;s Alchemy. It was quite different from his turtle pattern pot. It seemed that it was the alchemist himself who communicated with heaven and earth to attract the power of violence. After the transformation of those minerals, he became more gentle.</p>
<p>Soon, Zhang daphou&rsquo;s body began to tremble, shivering for half a column of incense. He took a deep breath, his eyes suddenly opened, and the silver light of his left hand glared at his eyes and swept along the body of the sword.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kailing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seems that the nothingness around is shocked. The silver light flies out of Zhang&rsquo;s left hand in an instant. It turns into countless silk threads and goes into the flying sword. In a blink of an eye, the flying sword becomes silver.</p>
<p>This scene is too amazing. Bai Xiaochun takes a breath and is really shocked.</p>
<p>For a long time, Zhang daphou breathes heavily and hands his silver flying sword to Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take it. This sword has been working now. If you pour the spiritual power into your body to test the spirit, you will succeed in silver veins!&rdquo; Zhang daphou wiped the sweat from his forehead and spoke out confidently.</p>
<p>When Bai Xiaochun took over the flying sword, she was in a great mood. Her spiritual power was suddenly scattered and integrated into the flying sword. However, at the moment of the fusion of spiritual power and flying sword, the sound of clicking came out. The silver light on the flying sword was dim for a moment, and finally completely disappeared. There were cracks on the sword, which seemed unable to withstand the forging of the force of heaven and earth, and the breath was completely lost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah?&rdquo; White small pure one Leng, Zhang big fat also stayed for a while, two people you look at me, I see you.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun coughed and was about to say that his sword was not of good quality. When he took the flying sword, his eyes were staring. He was breathing fast and carefully observing. After a moment, he stamped his foot fiercely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I made a mistake just now. I didn&rsquo;t control the melting amount of lingtie, which made the power of heaven and earth more violent. It&rsquo;s OK. Ninth younger martial brother, you give me another flying sword, and I&rsquo;ll make you practice it again!&rdquo; Zhang daphou looks at Bai Xiaochun persistently, with blood in his eyes.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun couldn&rsquo;t bear it, so he took out a flying sword again. Zhang took a deep breath. This time, he looked very serious. A moment later, when the second flying sword was full of silver light, he handed it to Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or Do you try it yourself, elder martial brother? &quot; Bai Xiaochun hesitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first iron law of alchemy, any alchemy item, unless it is the thing of the alchemist himself, can never be used as a spiritual test! This is an iron law, which cannot be violated. Once the precept is opened, it will cause numerous troubles in the future. &quot; Zhang said solemnly.</p>
<p>Seeing Zhang daphou&rsquo;s persistent appearance at the moment, Bai Xiaochun quickly takes over the flying sword. He really hopes to succeed. Otherwise, it will be a great blow to Zhang daphou.</p>
<p>As he pondered, Bai Xiaochun suddenly opened his mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That Elder martial brother, you wait for me here. I went back to my room to have a try. Just now I thought, maybe I was too nervous. &quot;</p>
