      <p>The young man in the sky had no expression, and his eyes swept the battlefield under his feet. Even when he saw the huge monsters who had guarded him fall down one by one, he seemed to have no movement, as if he had seen through the life and death for a long time.</p>
<p>When the wind blows, his figure slowly drops down from the dark clouds. The roar of beasts is more and more deafening. Even at his side, there are thin electric lights moving like a snake in the dark cloud.</p>
<p>Above the sea of clouds, the people and wild animals who were still fighting hard for a moment were still, and they could not help looking at the strange boy in the sky. He had some strange faces and seemed to have two lights in his pupils.</p>
<p>Finally, the beast God stopped in the middle of the sky, just above the countless beast demons. Behind him, the fierce beast Taotie opened his eyes and howled fiercely in the direction of Tongtian peak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roar&hellip;&rdquo; Almost at the same time, with the roar of gluttonous food, the animals roared with a loud voice. The sound wave suddenly came, but it was like a mountain and a sea. For a time, the wind and clouds changed color and the sand and flying stones were walking. Many people in the right path could not help but step back. In this roar, the body of Taotie suddenly swelled up, and in a flash it became a giant beast, surrounded by the beast God. And around them, something different happened.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the black clouds in the sky seemed to be under some kind of huge gravity. They came from all directions and gathered over the young animal God. Then they gradually formed a huge black wind column, which whirled rapidly and made a sharp sound of breaking the sky, and slowly fell from the sky.</p>
<p>The wind column is so thick that it seems that it can devour the whole peak. At this time, the sky is low and the wind is fierce. It is just like the end of the world, which makes people feel desperate.</p>
<p>People in the right path have changed their colors. Such magical powers and demons are really unprecedented and unheard of. Although people have long thought that this animal God must be a non ordinary person. But it was never expected that the evil spirit had such magical power. It is said that he was able to subdue him and suppress him in the ancient cave for thousands of years. I really don&rsquo;t know where it is.</p>
<p>Watching the huge wind column slowly fall, gradually exposed that dark and terrifying appearance, the invisible suction slowly began to cover all people above the sea of clouds.</p>
<p>Many disciples of the right path have begun to use their skills to resist it secretly. Anyone knows that if they are absorbed by this evil method, they are afraid that nine lives will not be able to survive.</p>
<p>Outside the Yuqing hall, daoxuan immortal and other three people looked grim. Master Pu Hong looked at the huge wind column for a long time. In a low voice, he said, &ldquo;these demons are really the only ones I have seen in my life. Elder martial brother daoxuan, those disciples at the bottom may not be able to resist such sorcery. Why don&rsquo;t we&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan nodded slowly and said, &ldquo;what the master said is very true. The Lord has come out. We should also&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just before his voice dropped, suddenly, the huge wind column changed its original slow falling trend and suddenly accelerated its speed to fall. Straight to the sea of clouds. At the same time, the roar of countless animal demons is more intense, straight through the clouds, extremely miserable. All the people in the right path have changed their color. In the face of this strange magic that has never been seen before, everyone does not know how to deal with it for a time.</p>
<p>Seeing that the wind column was about to fall on the sea of clouds, several brave people among the righteous disciples finally couldn&rsquo;t bear it. They first sacrificed their magic weapons to fight against the storm. The old man next to him stopped shouting as soon as he found out, but after all, a few people rushed out.</p>
<p>The magic weapons of the fairy sword twinkled. The light flashed into the wind column. It did not enter it for a moment, but it was like a bullock into the sea, and there was no sound. Then it seemed that something had been startled. Suddenly, there was a roar in the wind column. Several thick black whirlwinds, like visible ones, rushed straight to the disciples.</p>
<p>Everyone in the right path was shocked and resisted one after another. Unexpectedly, those whirlwinds seemed to have aura at all. When others resisted, it was like an invisible substance passing through. However, when they came to those people, the Black Whirlwind suddenly showed its ferocious face. In the shrill wind, the whirlwind entangled the disciples in a twinkling of an eye, and then shrank back with a sound of &ldquo;whoosh&rdquo;. The speed of the whirlwind was so fast that everyone could not And reaction, watching the disciples under the protection of the people, was pulled into the strange huge wind column.</p>
<p>In the distant distance, there was a faint voice of crying. In the wind column, the blood red light flashed suddenly. After a moment, there was no news.</p>
<p>The righteous people were silent for a moment and looked at each other.</p>
<p>The light suddenly rose, and three tiny lights fell from the sky and fell in front of the people of the right path. After the twinkling, the figures of real man daoxuan, master Puhong and Yun Yilan were revealed. All of them were dignified.</p>
<p>With a wave of his hand, the Taoist priest said in a hurry: &ldquo;all the disciples will step down and the elders will stay here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a commotion among the crowd, but then most of the younger generation&rsquo;s disciples retreated. Most of them were disciples of the three major sects. Naturally, they knew the importance of the situation. Even at such a critical moment, most of them were able to keep calm and the situation was not much chaotic.</p>
<p>Soon, there were only three masters and a dozen elders left in the field. In the war just now, only a few elders were dead.</p>
<p>The muscles on daoxuan&rsquo;s face twitched a little, and then he stopped looking. He turned to stare at the only enemy in front of him.</p>
<p>Under the control of the invisible and strange force, the huge black wind column falls from the sky. In the strong wind and black air, the young beast God&rsquo;s indifferent eyes seem to penetrate the killing in the world. In a cold look, they are separated from the grim eyes of Taoist immortal daoxuan.</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan&rsquo;s heart was slightly shocked. Although the animal God in the distance in front of him looked like a human being, his eyes in his eyes somehow had no human feelings. Between his cold and cold eyes, he seemed to regard all things in the world as inanimate animals. His intention of killing was so strong that he was really like a ferocious beast.</p>
<p>At this time, the wind column fell from the sky, and finally fell on the sea of clouds. In an instant, the extremely hard white jade plate made a low and dull sound on the place where the wind column fell. In a moment, countless cracks and tortoises were cracked and burst open, and countless sand and stone giant rocks were even rocked upward. In the wind column, there was a sound, like the roar of evil spirits and the roar of evil spirits. It seemed that they had heard some strange call. Suddenly, the bones of the six huge monsters, which had been removed by the righteous way with all their efforts, suddenly moved again.</p>
<p>People in the right way change color together!</p>
<p>At this time, however, there is no light in the world. A scene of desolation, ghost gas rolling, the six huge corpses, have staggered. Although not very smart, but it was attracted by the strange force, dragging a huge body, blowing a deep groove on the ground, was sucked into the huge wind column.</p>
<p>One. Another, until finally, the huge skeleton of the White Bone Demon snake was completely sucked into the black wind column and disappeared. Then, it seemed that there was a sharp roar in the nine secluded places, and a fierce spirit rose from the sky in the fierce wind. The beast God on the wind and cloud is expressionless, stepping on the big Taotie body and rushing into the wind column like a wind power switch.</p>
<p>At the moment, the thick smell of monsters even came down from the ground. The atmosphere also did not dare to come out, more some weak, burying his head to tremble, actually was frightened cannot own.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the wind stopped, the wind and cloud were still, and the world was silent. Then, the people and countless monsters hold their breath and stare at the monsters in the world.</p>
<p>Above the sea of clouds. A brand-new and unimaginable monster stood in awe. The height of its body was three times higher than that of the original six monsters. People and ordinary monsters were in front of this monster. As tiny as a mole ant.</p>
<p>From this monster, the smell of blood is constantly emitting. Even on its body, blood is constantly oozing. All you can see are white and dense bones, and the huge skeleton makes people understand it quickly. This is the horrible spirit that put together the corpses of the six giant monsters just now.</p>
<p>Standing on top of the head of the huge monster was the young beast God. His face was pale now, but in his eyes, the fierce intention of killing seemed to be more and more rampant.</p>
<p>The huge and ferocious white skull slowly shakes and makes a strange &ldquo;KaKa&rdquo; sound. Looking into the empty two eyes, it seems that there is another kind of invisible fierce light, which stares at those people in front of them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a foul smell coming from your face.</p>
<p>The reborn evil spirit seemed to be restless all over his body and growled low.</p>
<p>In addition, there was no sound above the sea of clouds. Countless people are looking at it with bated breath.</p>
<p>In front of the crowd, a dark green Taoist robe fluttered in the wind, and his face was solemn. Countless people in the consternation, or far or near, someone quietly looked at him, but in the face of the Taoist bone immortal wind, there was no expression, and no one knew what his mood was at the moment?</p>
<p>The huge evil spirit monster roared, and suddenly the white bones all over the body burst out a harsh sound. The huge body moved slowly and walked forward. With each step, the land under the feet seemed to be unable to withstand the pressure. It was deeply depressed, and the smell of blood floated everywhere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boom, boom, boom&hellip;&rdquo; This terrible thing moves very slowly, but every step, it seems to fall in the heart of the people in the right path. Countless people look at the pile of horrible white bones slowly approaching like a mountain. Even the characters like Xiao Yicai also turn pale.</p>
<p>Seeing that the evil spirit was about to come to him, his bones were as white as a mountain. Immortal daoxuan opened his mouth in a deep voice and said, &ldquo;brothers, follow me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as the words fell, I saw that the first three leaders of the right way incarnated into three kinds of milligrams, and took the lead to fly up. Then, they followed up with more than a dozen different kinds of milli rays and flew toward the evil spirit. But on the head of the huge evil spirit, the mysterious youth&rsquo;s face was indifferent, and in his eyes slowly reflected those strange things that had come.</p>
<p>Between heaven and earth, a sudden silence, like a feeling of breathlessness.</p>
<p>The pupil in the eye of the beast god suddenly shrinks, and he doesn&rsquo;t have any action. However, the huge monster under his feet suddenly raises his huge and ferocious head, opens his bloody mouth and roars up to the sky. Behind him, countless demon monsters suddenly burst into a mournful voice.</p>
<p>With the sound of the roar, the huge monster kept on the ground, and directly opened its big mouth to bite at the light coming from the air. From a distance, the ferocious appearance of the big mouth was that it could swallow all the righteous people with one bite.</p>
<p>However, these ten people are all masters of the right way. The elite of the elite is to look at the world. All the ways of the right, evil, demon, and witch are all first-class figures, and their accomplishments are not to be underestimated.</p>
<p>Sure enough, although the evil spirit was fierce and fierce, all the glimmers from the air scattered at the same time and flew in all directions. In a flash, the real bodies of the elders were shown, standing in the air. All of them scolded at each other for a moment, and the magic weapons were bright and attacked from different directions.</p>
<p>On the top of the cloud, daoxuan immortal, Pu Hong Shangren and Yun Yilan appear in the high place. Yun Yilan first made a move, his left hand was empty, but he could see that the fire in his hand suddenly appeared, like jade of pure Yang, born in the sky, like amber color. It was the magic art of burning incense valley which reached the ultimate level.</p>
<p>The flame looked like a solidified thing. It was burning in the hands of Yun Yilan. His hands turned over, his face was grim, and his hands were flying like a meteor flying across the sky. The pure flame of fire came out of his body and seemed to rotate slowly in the air. It seemed that he was flying towards the evil spirit.</p>
<p>At the moment, more than a dozen elders around have already sacrificed their magic weapons to fight against this terrible monster. On the huge white bone body, there are different kinds of mischievous impacts everywhere.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that the monster was hit by the magic weapons of these extremely powerful characters. Although its body vibrated, it did nothing under the power of ordinary people&rsquo;s soul. It just roared and screamed, which was obviously uncomfortable. Moreover, it looked more and more angry and fierce.</p>
<p>At this moment, in the middle of the sky, the flame of cloud Yilan emits amber light, which is small but not scattered, and flies to the monster. I don&rsquo;t know why, although the huge monster is unscrupulous to the magic weapon of the people around him, he has some scruples against the small flame. His body seems to shrink a little. But the body is too huge. How can we avoid it? In a short time, the flame falls on the mouth of the white bone head of the evil spirit and collides with the white bones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hiss&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the numerous roaring and disordered sounds, the humble little voice, the amber like small flame, was burned into the hard bone as big as the mountain, and a deep hole appeared in the white bone. And the flame disappeared into the deep hole.</p>
<p>They were shocked and held their breath.</p>
<p>A moment later, suddenly, a huge roar roared from the depths of the bones. It was like a volcano suddenly born in the depths of the evil spirit&rsquo;s bones. The intense heat wave spread out in an instant. Half of the body of the originally white bones was roasted to a yellow color. A red flame was more than ten feet thick, and burst out of the bones and burst into the sky. Even the Qingyun disciples in the distance felt extremely hot, not to mention the monster under the red flame.</p>
<p>For a while, people in the right path were very excited. The means of the three leaders of the right path were really incomparable.</p>
<p>If the volcano erupts, the arrogant and incomparable heat flame gradually dissipates, and the strange monsters shrouded in the fierce flame slowly appear. Half of the body is baked to be burnt black color. Although it is even more weird and terrifying, it seems that the appearance is extremely embarrassed than just now, and there is no trace of ferocity.</p>
<p>All the people in the right path who were shocked by the terrible scene of the monster&rsquo;s appearance were relieved and breathed a long breath. It&rsquo;s also right to think about it. Are there people like immortals who have made contributions to nature, such as daoxuan immortal, who are still afraid of monsters and ghosts?</p>
<p>But, somehow, compared with the jubilant young disciples in the distance behind them, the faces of the three rightist giants above the clouds were strangely gloomy. (to be continued.</p>
