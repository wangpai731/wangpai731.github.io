      <p>It wasn&rsquo;t long after the pursuit of Biyao and others, this dark place just experienced a fierce fight. Just as it was about to recover gradually, I heard the sharp sound of &ldquo;abetting and abetting&rdquo; from the top. A white, a green and two lights shot down. After two shakes, I stopped for a while. There was a man and a woman in the light group. They were Li Xun and Yan Hong under the gate of incendiary valley.</p>
<p>Li Xun&rsquo;s handsome face is also slightly surprised at the moment. With the magic light, he looks around and says to Yan Hong, &ldquo;younger martial sister, I can&rsquo;t imagine that there is such a cave under the demon fox&rsquo;s nest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yan Hong&rsquo;s face was also a little surprised. She nodded, &ldquo;yes, I&rsquo;ve never seen such a scene in the past. Many monsters are afraid of never appearing in the world.&rdquo; dun dun said in a low voice, &ldquo;elder martial brother, the situation here is strange. We should be careful because of the danger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li Xun smiled a little and said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t worry, younger martial sister. I&rsquo;m sorry that the evil fox hasn&rsquo;t been in Taoism for five hundred years. What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yan Hong smiled and said: &ldquo;elder martial brother, you are gifted and have a profound way of life. You are not afraid of the evil spirit. But in case that&rdquo; six tailed evil Fox &ldquo;is also beside&rdquo; three tailed evil Fox &ldquo;, with its thousand year long way of life, you are afraid of some trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li Xun glanced at Yan Hong and smiled a little. Suddenly he said, &ldquo;younger martial sister, although you are very nice, I am afraid that I am worried about my greedy work as a senior brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yan Hong said in a low voice, &ldquo;elder martial brother, you worry too much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li Xun turned around and looked at the four weeks. He said lightly, &ldquo;younger martial sister, do you feel that the temperature under the abyss is abnormal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yan Hong nodded and said, &ldquo;yes, it&rsquo;s deeper, but it seems hotter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li Xun said: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not a little hotter, but a lot hotter than usual. Moreover, I came down all the way, looked at the black stone in the abyss carefully, and concluded that this was the ancient time. Magma from the bottom of the earth rushed out of the ground and cooled. Most of the abyss is a crater! &quot;</p>
<p>Yan Hong &ldquo;ah&rdquo; a light call, and then beautiful eyes in the eye wave flow. Immediately, like awakening in the heart, he said, &ldquo;you mean&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li Xun then said: &ldquo;yes, that&rsquo;s what it means. The demon fox specially chooses the crater as its nest. Three hundred years ago, there were many thieves in the fox. Without knowing how to live or die, I entered the forbidden area of burning incense Valley and stole the XuanHuo artifact.</p>
<p>But what kind of person was the senior martial uncle guarding the Shengong that day? After hearing the news, he came here and showed his power. He was about to capture a group of evil foxes. Only six evil foxes could be hated for their treacherous nature and become a fish that missed the net. &quot;</p>
<p>Speaking of this, he suddenly sneered, and then continued: &ldquo;but martial uncle Shangguan is very good. The magic weapon &ldquo;nine colds and ice stab&rdquo; is the world&rsquo;s first-class unique treasure, with unparalleled power. I&rsquo;ve heard from the valley master in the past that although the six tailed fox escaped by chance, it has been stabbed into the fox&rsquo;s vein by martial uncle Shangguan with the ice of nine colds to destroy its Taoist foundation. In the past three hundred years, even if it doesn&rsquo;t die, it will be in great pain. The Taoism will be over, and ice poison will attack the heart and hurt the body day and night, unless it is in the place where the sun is hot. To relieve the pain. &quot;</p>
<p>Yan Hong smiled and said, &ldquo;in this way, most of the six tailed foxes are under the abyss. Elder martial brother, I admire your foresight. &quot;</p>
<p>Li Xun&rsquo;s face is a little proud again. &ldquo;We are the disciples of the burning incense valley. We can&rsquo;t lose face because of the kindness of our school. This time, I just hope that God will bless us, and that things will return to their original owners, and that artifacts will return to their original places, and that demons will kill them. &quot;</p>
<p>Yan Hong smiles. Li Xun took a look at her and said, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yan Hong&rsquo;s forehead, two people&rsquo;s body shape rise, turn into fast light again, rush down that dark deep place.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s right hand tightly grasps the fire stick, but his body is tightly held by the huge tentacle. He almost hears the bones in his body creak. All over the body, there is no place without pain, but also with the huge tentacles toward the bottom of the ground, the wind blows the surface and makes pain. However, I feel that Venus in front of me is in chaos and flashed some terrible pictures in my mind.</p>
<p>The length of the tentacle is really appalling. It has been pulled down for about five Zhangs. Zhang Xiaofan suddenly takes a look around him in the confusion with a glimmer of light. He sees that the front has reached the bottom of the abyss. There is no grass around here. There is only a huge stone hole on the front wall, which is ten Zhangs high, seven Zhangs wide, and eight Zhangs wide. It is dark and deep inside You can&rsquo;t see the bottom.</p>
<p>This huge tentacle is the monster protruding from this huge cave. Now I see its back end, which is even bigger and incomparable. I don&rsquo;t know what its whole body looks like if it is a creature.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was waved in the air by the tentacle, and was dragged into the cave by the tentacle. But at this moment, the light of the huge cave was shining, and the three evil foxes, who had disappeared for a long time, suddenly appeared with the xuanhuojian in their hands.</p>
<p>As soon as she looked up, she saw that Zhang Xiaofan was tightly held by this huge tentacle, and saw that there was no power to fight back. With a flash of murderous air on her soft face, she would turn back and say something to the cave. But somehow she thought of something else, and suddenly stopped, turned around, looked deeply at Zhang Xiaofan, who was struggling but useless. With a sigh, she whispered, &ldquo;look at the full moon well. It&rsquo;s just a lover. That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she said this, she held up the xuanhuojian in her hand and took a picture of the huge cave. At the same time, there was a strange low roar in her mouth. Her voice was quiet and sharp. She listened as if she were a fox barking in the wild.</p>
<p>After a while, it seemed that he had received some orders. The huge tentacle quickly retreated into the cave with a sound of &ldquo;Instigation&rdquo;. Zhang Xiaofan could not see any light in front of him. He felt that it was full of strange fishy places, and the surface of his tentacle was even slippery. But somehow, he could not pull himself out. He could not move at all 。</p>
<p>At the same time, the three evil foxes outside the cave heard the roaring sound, looked up and saw two beams of light, gold and white, shooting down quickly. She sneered twice, flashed back to the cave, and xuanhuojian took a picture of the cave. The fox barked like before again.</p>
<p>Those two beams of light are naturally stones and Baguio. When they saw three foxes, they were very happy. Baguio had more eyes, but there was no figure of Zhang Xiaofan around, and they were worried. But before the two of them could stop, with the action of three evil foxes, there was a gust of wind in the huge cave, and a huge tentacle rushed out. He called both of them.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was trapped in the dark and dragged by the tentacle all the way. He bumped on the stone wall in the cave, which seemed to turn a few corners. Although there is no blood flow from the head, it is inevitable to be disheartened. However, no one can see where he can&rsquo;t reach his fingers.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how deep this drag went, but I think the smell is becoming more and more strong. But there was no light and darkness around. I couldn&rsquo;t see the surroundings at all.</p>
<p>Fortunately, although the huge tentacle still tightly held his body, the three evil foxes seemed to have issued an order not to hurt him for a while. The tentacle did not continue to tighten, and Zhang Xiaofan was able to breathe for a while.</p>
<p>At last, the giant tentacle stopped and stopped moving in a dark place. But still tightly strangled Zhang Xiaofan.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan gasped for breath and was still in shock.</p>
<p>Dark as a mountain, in front of their own, endless.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan suddenly felt that in front of him, in the dark depths, there might be an incredible giant monster, occupying here. As soon as he thought about it, he was three points cold from head to toe.</p>
<p>This ancient cave seems to have no light from ancient times. Dark as ink, but the unknown world, but gave people the oldest and most profound fear.</p>
<p>The huge tentacles around him seemed to remind him all the time. In front of him, what he is facing is what an incredible creature it is.</p>
<p>Time, as if frozen.</p>
<p>In the distance, there was a faint sound of fighting and a loud noise, although it was low. But it sounds familiar.</p>
<p>Suddenly, in the dark, something seemed to flutter uneasily. In the dark, suddenly there was a wave. Though Zhang Xiaofan could not see it, he thought about it. He wondered if the giant monster was here, but he held out another tentacle to fight with Biyao and others outside the cave.</p>
<p>However, this idea didn&rsquo;t last for a long time. Zhang Xiaofan suddenly found that his tentacles, which had no longer been forced, suddenly seemed to be frightened or for some other reason, and began to tighten again. Although the speed was not very fast, with the huge tentacles, the force of internal pressure was indeed overwhelming.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s whole body was in great pain and cried out. He recklessly supported his practice of Taiji Xuanqing Taoism. However, his tentacles were like ghosts, which had overwhelming power and could not be stopped.</p>
<p>Seeing that his chest and ribs are rattling and his Qi and blood are surging, Zhang Xiaofan can&rsquo;t care so much anymore. He is in a hurry to seek medical treatment. He tries to run the other half of his secret self-cultivation, the Buddhist dharma &ldquo;mahavana Prajna&rdquo; which is handed down from the general wisdom God monk of Tianyin temple, hoping to resist for a moment more.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, it&rsquo;s not lucky. When it&rsquo;s lucky, the supreme Dharma of Buddhism is quite different from the magic of Qingyun sect. The way of practice is even more different. Unexpectedly, it immediately turns over the river in the body and repels Haiti. When the whole body&rsquo;s meridians stand up, it&rsquo;s as painful as needles.</p>
<p>At the same time, the huge external tentacles are constantly under pressure, and the muscles and bones are ready to crack. Zhang Xiaofan people in the dark, indecisive, people&rsquo;s mind is also under great pressure, gradually blurred up.</p>
<p>At this moment, at the critical moment of his life and death, his mind flashed an inexplicable paragraph:</p>
<p>“…… The heaven is without punishment and the Tao praises the nameless. That&rsquo;s why people who have no self, no one, no living beings and no life are able to reach the light. He who holds a right path, inner body and self nature, and the heaven and earth take this as the heart&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>These words, as if lit up in his heart, echoed in his mind. This is the text in the general outline of the first volume of &ldquo;the book of heaven&rdquo;. He was puzzled at first. The two Buddhist and Taoist practices are fundamentally different. How can they be integrated into one at last.</p>
<p>But at this moment, he was in the Jedi, his whole body was about to split, and he was in a state of suffering. Somewhere in his mind, somehow, he gradually became clear, even ignoring the pain of the heart cone, and only echoed the words deeply engraved in his mind:</p>
<p>“……</p>
<p>Therefore, in the world of motion and rest, the mind of heaven and earth sees.</p>
<p>Therefore, there is no reality, no emptiness.</p>
<p>Therefore, the heaven and the earth are free of nature, and nothing can be done without creation.</p>
<p>Therefore, if things are not kept, they are not enough to be prepared!</p>
<p>……”</p>
<p>He has been holding in his hand, but has lost the luster of the fire stick, at this moment, suddenly and slowly lit up.</p>
<p>The dark green light is faint.</p>
<p>Cold feeling, swimming through the body.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan couldn&rsquo;t see anything in the dark, but his eyes widened, and his brain filled with only one sentence: &ldquo;so if there&rsquo;s no existence, it&rsquo;s not enough to prepare Therefore, things do not exist. It&rsquo;s not enough Therefore, if things are not kept, they are not enough to be prepared! &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He raised his head and shouted to the sky. But the voice is hoarse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Therefore, if there is no existing thing, it is not enough to prepare it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two Qi of great Brahma Prajna and taijixuanqingdao, which had been fighting in his body, suddenly flowed into the sea like Hongchuan. After a fierce collision, they rushed out from his right arm. Sheng Sheng forces into the black fire stick.</p>
<p>In a moment, the fire staff was shining. Under the dark blue halo, it seemed that there was something exciting on the staff. The thread of the silk was clear. Even the blood seemed to get fresh blood. It was slightly pulsating and throbbing, as if it flowed dark red, obscure and strange blood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s accompanied by the fire stick. Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s whole body makes strange noises everywhere, but it&rsquo;s not the sound of broken bones. It sounds like a violent heartbeat, a boiling plasma, a hole in the skin, but there&rsquo;s no strange sound around him!</p>
<p>Unconsciously, Zhang Xiaofan regained his mind and looked at it. He didn&rsquo;t think about the changes in his body, but he found that he was still strangled by the giant tentacle. However, the difference was that he forced the two dharmas of Buddhism and Taoism into the burning staff after his instant insight. The fire staff has already sent out a little different luster from the past. In the dark blue light, there are still faint strands of gold light, and the flickering light of blood red light. With some ferocity, with horror, especially clear.</p>
<p>However, the halo had barely spread the tentacles around for a little distance, but then Zhang Xiaofan found that the power of the huge tentacles was too strong. It seems that after Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s resistance suddenly became stronger, the force of internal pressure was also greatly pushed in with a momentum of 10 times and 100 times. For only a moment, the magic circle of the firebrand&rsquo;s resurfacing was already crumbling and could not be supported.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan is not a fool. How can he not know that he will die if he goes on like this. At the moment, he took a big risk, took a Fierce bite of his teeth, and urged all his strength to hold the magic force. The light of the fire staff was suddenly full. Taking this last opportunity, Zhang Xiaofan roared and drove the fire staff to attack his trapped tentacles like a flash of electricity.</p>
<p>Just listen to a muffled &ldquo;poof&rdquo; sound. The fire staff is completely submerged and stabbed in like a magic weapon blade.</p>
<p>In the darkness, the only burning stick that emits light falls into the tentacle, and the surrounding area is suddenly dark without any light. Feel the dark breath, feel the endless silence around, Zhang Xiaofan has such a moment, the whole people hold their breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sudden!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A ray of light suddenly appeared. From the top of the tentacle, it pierced a big hole, revealing the strange light of the fire stick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sudden!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another dull sound, on the other side of the tentacle, another light burst out!</p>
<p>Then, &ldquo;suddenly, suddenly, suddenly!&rdquo; Zhang Xiaofan opened his mouth slightly and looked at the huge tentacle, which was trapped in him. At the moment, it was like a piece of thin paper that was constantly pierced. More and more light was emitted from it, illuminating the surrounding ground for several feet and illuminating himself.</p>
<p>Soon, Zhang Xiaofan felt that his feeler, which was trapped by him, was slipping down powerlessly. At this moment, the fire stick went out of his feeler body and flew back to his hand. With the halo of the fire staff, Zhang Xiaofan saw that there were huge scars on his tentacles, which were scorched and cracked everywhere, which was quite different from the tough and greasy appearance just now.</p>
<p>He just managed to escape from the ghost gate. He was shocked. At present, the monster was also strange. He still had no voice and didn&rsquo;t seem to feel any pain.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan gasps for breath, just wants to find his way out, but only listens to the darkness in front of him. He makes another dark scream, and the huge wind rushes in like a mountain. A little closer, Zhang Xiaofan looks at it with a glimmer of light, almost frightened, and even his chin falls off. He sees that there are huge tentacles in the dark, and the shadow dances wildly, but he doesn&rsquo;t know how many.</p>
<p>This tentacle is almost a small life, how to face this situation, the end can be imagined. Zhang Xiaofan didn&rsquo;t want to think about it. With one move, he started to fly, turned around, and left. Unexpectedly, he flew less than a foot. &ldquo;Bang&rdquo; was that even the man with the stick hit the hard stone wall.</p>
<p>This time, it hurt deeply. It was really heavy. I felt that there was something wet and greasy on my face. I was afraid that I saw blood, but now I can&rsquo;t care so much.</p>
<p>But now he is trapped in this dark cave, like a blind man. When he was just caught by the tentacle, he was dragged into the cave again. He can&rsquo;t remember the way. At present, I&rsquo;m like a fly without a head. I&rsquo;m wearing a fire stick, almost relying on instinct and the great wind. I bumped around in this cave, accidentally bumped into the stone wall. I can hide for a while anyway.</p>
<p>But the tentacles in the dark were not only huge, but also very flexible. Zhang Xiaofan fled for his life, but only listened to the roar of the wind behind him. He was so close to his back that he couldn&rsquo;t help but split his heart. He closed his eyes at the critical moment, shouted and rushed forward recklessly with the fire stick, hoping to get as far away from the tentacles as possible.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, under the force of his desperation and running, although the speed of the fire stick increased sharply, the stone wall in front of him didn&rsquo;t give face, and didn&rsquo;t fly over three feet, &ldquo;boom&rdquo; again hit the stone wall.</p>
<p>But this time, it seems strange that the stone wall there seems to be relatively weak. After a collision, it was hit directly into it, and some light came out of it. There were even hot waves rolling in.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was surprised, but before he could get back to his senses, he felt that his body was empty, but the whole man fell into a narrow and downward inclined corridor and rolled down.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how long this roll lasted, but all the way up, Zhang Xiaofan was in chaos. He only felt that the surroundings were full of red light. At the same time, the heat wave was blazing, and the tentacles were extremely hot. He met the wounds several times, and his eyes were full of pain.</p>
<p>In fact, if you tell the truth, Zhang Xiaofan can support up to now, I&rsquo;m afraid that it&rsquo;s more like a stone than the stone that is fighting outside.</p>
<p>Finally, the tumbling body stopped. Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s mouth was bleeding, his face was scarred and his whole body seemed to be falling apart. He raised his head slowly in * *.</p>
<p>Then he froze.</p>
<p>At present, there is a huge underground cave, but unlike before, it is full of hot to red magma, forming a scorching lake and flooding the whole cave. On the surface of the lake, from time to time, there are bubbles of heat waves rising, then breaking, and there are more turbulent places. Like the tide, the hot magma does not spring up until it is half empty. And the red hot flame from the magma, is the huge cave into a red world.</p>
<p>As for Zhang Xiaofan himself, he is on a platform above the magma lake, behind which is an upward corridor, from which he rolls down. In front of him, at the end of the platform, near the hot magma, which was almost unbearable, was an oval shaped stone pit, on which lay a white fox.</p>
<p>White, fox!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s eyes closed, as if sleeping peacefully, curled up, very quiet.</p>
<p>Very beautiful!</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan slowly stood up, held his breath and walked towards it.</p>
<p>Slowly, step by step, walked in the past.</p>
<p>The heat wave was even hotter. Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s face was red, but he didn&rsquo;t feel it. He stared at the beautiful, beautiful, gentle and quiet Fox and the place behind him.</p>
<p>There, beautiful fur, quietly curling its tail.</p>
<p>There are six tails in the place of small and beautiful fur, bifurcation and harmony. (to be continued. )</p>
