      <p>&ldquo;Who? &quot;</p>
<p>At the same time, there were several loud voices of Qingyun disciples outside the Yuqing hall, but only a few of them were brushed. It seemed that some high-ranking people came to fight against the sky. Then there were several thumps. Several Qingyun disciples fell in and rolled to the ground.</p>
<p>At the door, there are four figures. They are the four masters of the demon sect.</p>
<p>Yuyangzi and poison God stood in the middle, the ghost king and Sanmiao fairy stood on both sides, four people looked at the hall and walked in slowly.</p>
<p>The oldest poison God uttered a &ldquo;tut tut&rdquo; in his mouth and smiled, &ldquo;Taoist Xuan, an old friend, has been missing for a hundred years. Are you ok? &quot;</p>
<p>The immortal daoxuan was shocked, his pupils contracted and said coldly, &ldquo;poison God! &quot;</p>
<p>The poison God laughed and said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s me who is immortal. Hundred years ago, I was defeated by your sword at the foot of Qingyun Mountain. I&rsquo;m so glad to see you look like you used to be! &quot;</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan looked at the four people one by one. At the same time, from the gate of Yuqing hall, he walked into dozens of people from the demon sect one after another. He saw the manner of these people. He was afraid that no one was friendly to each other. Most of the strength of the demon sect over the past hundred years was here. Among them, people have seen Qinglong and Youji of the ghost King sect, baiduzi of the ten thousand poisons sect and so on. Most of the others are experts of the four sects.</p>
<p>In the distance, the shouts of killing are louder and louder. From time to time, I hear the screams of despair. In the past, Qingyun Mountain, like fairyland on earth, seems to be shrouded in blood, like hell.</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan breathed deeply, and reluctantly settled his mind. Today&rsquo;s misfortune is coming to an end, and foreign enemies are marching in. It&rsquo;s the most critical moment of Qingyun gate in the past hundred years. As the supreme leader of Qingyun sect, he must not let this foundation industry be destroyed in his own hands.</p>
<p>At this time, all of a sudden, he heard a Buddha&rsquo;s name, but master Puhong was standing beside immortal daoxuan at some time, with a light smile on his face. He said, &ldquo;elder martial brother daoxuan, since ancient times, evil has prevailed, and I am a member of Tianyin temple. He has always been with Qingyun sect to fight against demons and evil ways. If you have any errands, just give me orders. &quot;</p>
<p>The great joy of daoxuan is almost at the same time. Those people in the burning incense Valley, led by the senior official, stood behind immortal daoxuan and master Puhong.</p>
<p>The four masters of the demon sect changed their colors slightly. The poison God looked at Puhong and said in a deep voice, &ldquo;which monk is this master in Tianyin temple? &quot;</p>
<p>Puhong said with a smile, &ldquo;old benefactor is forgetful.</p>
<p>A hundred years ago, we had a meeting in the battle of Zhengmo. How could we forget the old man? I&rsquo;m Puhong in Tianyin temple. Next to me is Pukong, my younger martial brother. &quot;</p>
<p>How famous are the four God monks in Tianyin temple? With these two people, if there are several experts in Qingyun gate, what&rsquo;s more, there are experts in burning incense Valley nearby?</p>
<p>The poison God turned to the pale Taoist Cangsong and frowned, &ldquo;how are these people here? &quot;</p>
<p>Taoist Cangsong said maliciously, &ldquo;these bald donkeys and the guys from burning incense Valley suddenly arrived at Qingyun Mountain this morning. I didn&rsquo;t know in advance. I was unprepared. Unable to report. &quot;</p>
<p>Puhong looks at the old man Shangguan of the burning incense valley behind him and laughs. Shangguan of the burning incense Valley laughs and says, &ldquo;this is the so-called evil is invincible and the sky is vast. Today, we will let you, the bold demons and evil ways, kill them all on the Qingyun Mountain! &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haha! &ldquo;He sneered, but he was standing beside the poisonous God. Yuyangzi, who was pushed by the people of the demon sect, was arrogant and sneered,&rdquo; more than a hundred years ago. My saints fought with you and other three sects with the power of my first teaching. Are we afraid that you will not succeed today! &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well said! &ldquo;The cheers immediately rang, many from the crowd standing behind the four patriarchs. It is the ghost King beside him who also caresses and laughs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see today whether we are going to kill you or whether you are going to die! &quot;</p>
<p>What he said was that he was so rampant and looked down upon all living beings. All the people in the right way were discolored and disgusted, especially the last word of &ldquo;death&rdquo;. The ghost king also seems to have accentuated his tone, which is full of sarcasm.</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan sneered. Just about to say something, he saw that yuyangzi in the demon sect seemed to be the most impatient. With a wave of his hand, all the masters of the demon sect were shining with various colors. Obviously, they were going to start at once.</p>
<p>In the right way, Qingyun gate and Tianyin temple were all on guard immediately, knowing that there was the most dangerous battle between Zhengmo and demons in the past hundred years. Puhong whispered, &ldquo;Amitabha, good, good&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, before he had finished a sentence, he suddenly began to change abruptly. When all the people&rsquo;s attention was on the people of the demon sect in front of him, suddenly dozens of rays of light rose at the same time of the people in the right way, and two of them were sharp, hitting Puhong&rsquo;s unprepared back!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boom! &quot;</p>
<p>In an instant, the main road is like a frying pan, which is in a mess. The sharp roar suddenly rings.</p>
<p>In front of the dark, master Puhong felt that two strong forces hit his back, one burst like a landslide and a tsunami, while the other turned into luouy sharp needle and thrust in.</p>
<p>Master Puhong falters and pours out a blood mist. What a character he is, he suddenly knows that there are traitors in the right way. A transcendent &ldquo;great Brahma Prajna Dharma&rdquo; passes all over his body for a moment, blocking the huge force, and at the same time, he doesn&rsquo;t look back. A sleeve is thrown back!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bang bang&rdquo; two muffled sounds, behind the people came two screams, obviously suffered losses, the huge force immediately dissipated, but another strength like a poisonous needle turned into a tangible thing, finally pierced his unexpected Da Fan Prajna body protection, and penetrated into the body.</p>
<p>In a short time, Qingyun men Tian and other people had already rushed over and started one after another, but after the attacker hit, they jumped up immediately and flew to the demon sect group.</p>
<p>At the head of the group, it was the burning incense Valley&rsquo;s superior policy, and all the people who attacked others were the burning incense Valley&rsquo;s people.</p>
<p>The decent people, including Puhong and Pukong who were attacked, were shocked. After a long time, immortal daoxuan tried to calm his mind and pointed to the superior officer and said, &ldquo;what are you doing? Did burning incense Valley join the demon sect? &quot;</p>
<p>Shangguance stood beside the four great lords of the demon sect and Taoist Cangsong. He looked at them at the same time, and suddenly burst out laughing. His mind was wild and full of contentment.</p>
<p>The ghost King laughed and said to daoxuanzhen, &ldquo;who told you that they were from the burning Valley? &quot;</p>
<p>When Taoist Xuan was about to open his mouth, he suddenly lost his voice and turned slowly to look at Taoist Cangsong. His face was pale and he said, &ldquo;OK, OK, you did well. As expected, it&rsquo;s not true! &quot;</p>
<p>Taoist Cangsong gave a sneer and said with a smile, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not because the leader of the ghost king is resourceful. I heard that the donkey of Tianyin Temple didn&rsquo;t come here suddenly. If you want to ruin my great event, you immediately want to send an expert to go up the mountain disguised as the gate of burning incense Valley, and select some people who don&rsquo;t walk on the earth in ordinary times. I&rsquo;ll introduce them to you. Ha ha. It was a success! &quot;</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan shook his body for a moment. Looking around, he saw that this time he was attacked by the demon sect. The general target was all concentrated among the monks of Tianyin temple. Nine out of ten were seriously hurt. In particular, master Puhong, the leader, whose face is as white as paper, can&rsquo;t stand at the moment. With the support of disciple Faxiang, he slowly sat down behind him. There was a blur of flesh and blood.</p>
<p>To others, the situation is not so good. Even in Qingyun gate, five or six elders were injured.</p>
<p>The immortal daoxuan&rsquo;s heart was churning, and his heart sank gradually. He smiled miserably and said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s powerful. I&rsquo;ve lived for many years, but I didn&rsquo;t expect that the senior official of the burning incense Valley, Dao Shu, had always been guarding the XuanHuo altar, never left the burning incense Valley. I have no doubt about you! &quot;</p>
<p>The ghost king looked at him, smiled and shook his head. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t think of this, but you Cangsong junior brother betrayed you, did you? &quot;</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan laughed again.</p>
<p>On the Yuqing hall, there was a moment of silence. In the right way, people look at each other. At this moment, anyone can see that the demon sect has a great advantage. Although there are many elders and experts in Qingyun sect, there are only more in the demon sect. Among the monks of Tianyin temple. At the moment, it seems that only half of them can reach the target, of which only Pukong and Faxiang are immune from injury due to their alertness.</p>
<p>Pukong, in particular, suddenly looks like a new man, holding a golden bowl in his hand, shining with gold, almost like a ferocious God. In front of him was a mess of blood and flesh, but just now a demon sect expert had calculated that he could not succeed. Instead, he was beaten into meat sauce by the universal magic weapon &ldquo;the golden pot of the pagoda&rdquo;.</p>
<p>But the most important thing is that the two great people, daoxuan immortal and Puhong master, who have always been called the world&rsquo;s top two heroes, have been hit hard at the same time. At the moment, they see that Puhong master&rsquo;s face is like white paper, and although daoxuan immortal is better, he looks like the end of a powerful force.</p>
<p>Is the world&rsquo;s right way really exhausted?</p>
<p>This problem, like the heaviest stone, lies on the heart of the righteous.</p>
<p>On the contrary, all the people in the demon sect are exuberant. For more than a hundred years, the demon sect has been expelled from the Central Plains and trapped in the wilderness. How can they not be arrogant once they raise their eyebrows today?</p>
<p>Yuyangzi felt that he was in charge of the whole situation. The holy religion won the battle against the two powerful righteous sects. In the future, he must be superior to others in the holy religion. Maybe from today on, he can bring the longevity hall to the blood refining Hall of the black heart old man 800 years ago.</p>
<p>Thinking of this, yuyangzi was even more proud of it. He said with a loud smile to immortal daoxuan, &ldquo;old thief daoxuan, quickly hand over the ancient sword of killing immortals, which is the treasure of your town, and then put it under the command of our holy religion. I will spare you and wait for you! Ha ha ha ha</p>
<p>Standing behind him, dozens of demon sect masters laughed together. It seems that only today can they enjoy the evil spirit of one hundred years!</p>
<p>In the distance, the cry of Qingyun disciples fighting on Tongtian peak seems to have made a miserable preparation for Qingyun gate&rsquo;s fate now!</p>
<p>However, immortal daoxuan&rsquo;s pale face was firm and resolute. He sneered at yuyangzi and said coldly, &ldquo;even if our Qingyun sect is killed in your hands today, we will not bend our knees to surrender. &quot;</p>
<p>Then he stepped back and returned to the crowd of Qingyun gate. Tian Nanyi, Shang Zhengliang and other first elders all gathered around when they arrived. His proud disciple Xiao Yicai also supported his body and said in a low voice anxiously, &ldquo;master, your body&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan snorted and said, &ldquo;at present, the disaster lies in eyebrows and lashes. Younger martial brother Tian, younger martial brother Shang, younger martial brother Zeng, younger martial brother Tianyun, you are here to support for a while. Younger martial sister Shuiyue, with several second generation disciples, first sent the Taoist friends of Tianyin Temple away. They were injured to help Qingyun. We can&rsquo;t let them suffer any more damage. &quot;</p>
<p>All the people he told immediately nodded and said, &ldquo;Tian is not easy to follow him.&rdquo; we are in the way here, chief and senior brother. If you are seriously injured, go away quickly and stay in the green mountain. In the future</p>
<p>Suddenly he stopped talking, but everyone knew the meaning of the words. Zeng Shuchang and other leaders nodded at the same time, but immortal daoxuan smiled miserably and said, &ldquo;master Jiye, did you make me abandon it? I would rather die than be a sinner! &quot;</p>
<p>Tian is not easy to wait for others to be silent. When daoxuan looks at the evil cult people who are ready to move at the moment, he suddenly seems to have made up his mind. He murmurs, &ldquo;until now, he has only disobeyed the rules of his ancestors and killed them with that! &quot;</p>
<p>someone else. Most of the elders are shocked.</p>
<p>Taoist Xuan took a deep breath and said, &ldquo;there is not much time. I&rsquo;ll invite you to take out the ancient sword to kill the immortals. You&hellip; He looked around. Suddenly he whispered, &ldquo;no matter what you think of me in your heart, but now, be careful! &quot;</p>
<p>Tian can&rsquo;t wait for someone to move. He was about to say something. Suddenly, he heard a wild laugh. The magic weapon flickered, and the people in the demon sect finally started.</p>
<p>In an instant, the original solemn and solemn Yuqing hall was filled with magic weapons flying in the air, different lights crisscrossing and loud noises.</p>
<p>In the chaos, while the elders and experts of Qingyun sect were attacking the demon sect experts, Shuiyue led the young disciples to help the seriously injured masters of Tianyin temple into the back hall, and immortal daoxuan also walked backward, but his steps were a bit faltering.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not easy for Tian to see this in the confrontation. There was a rush of anxiety in my heart and a glance. The red flame immortal sword in my hand forced the people of the evil cult in front of me to dodge to the side of Qi Hao and Lin Jingyu, who were fighting with the elders but were pale. They said, &ldquo;you are not needed here. You are going to escort the real leader immediately! &quot;</p>
<p>Qi Hao and Lin Jingyu were shocked, but they didn&rsquo;t dare to disobey Tian&rsquo;s orders. Moreover, Taoist Cangsong, the first Taoist in dragon head peak, suddenly rebelled. For these disciples of dragon head peak. It&rsquo;s like a bolt from the blue. It&rsquo;s early chaos. At this time, I hurriedly responded and went with immortal daoxuan.</p>
<p>And look at them. Su Ru, who was fighting on the other side, frowned tightly. After a while, she took a chance to get out of her body and flashed to song Daren and Tian linger. She murmured, &ldquo;your uncle Cangsong suddenly rebelled. His disciples don&rsquo;t know if they are reliable. You follow the leader! &quot;</p>
<p>Song Daren and Tian linger are shocked. He immediately understood and followed up. Su Ru was about to turn around when she saw Zhang Xiaofan, the little apprentice who was the focus of the whole audience just now, standing there like no one else. She did not know that luoua was looking at the front of the demon sect, and she did not move.</p>
<p>She frowned. In fact, in her heart, it was not easy to be like Tian. She didn&rsquo;t believe that the little apprentice would be a traitor of the demon sect. At the moment, she thought that Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s skill was superficial, and then flashed to him and patted him on the shoulder.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s body shook and turned around. Su Ru was suddenly shocked. Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s eyes were bloodshot. Although he was conscious, he didn&rsquo;t know that luoua always had a strange sense of ferocity.</p>
<p>But now the situation is urgent. How can Su Ru think about it? She said, &ldquo;Xiao Fan, it&rsquo;s too dangerous here. You follow your elder martial brother and elder martial sister ling&rsquo;er. &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was stunned for a while, but under the gaze of the teacher who cherished himself since childhood, he finally nodded and ran back to the hall.</p>
<p>Su Ru put her heart down and joined the more and more fierce battle group!</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan ran into the back hall, caught up with song Daren and Tian linger, and then Qi Hao and Lin Jingyu. Several people surrounded Taoist Xuan.</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan glanced at them and nodded slightly, but when he looked at Zhang Xiaofan, he could not help but stop for a moment and then moved away.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan doesn&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s like, but the fire stick in his hand has a faint blue light at the moment. From time to time, he feels dizzy in his mind. He only thinks that the evil spirit is like a ferocious spirit. He goes straight to his mind and can&rsquo;t help imagining the bloody spirit.</p>
<p>However, at present, everyone is in a heavy mood, and no one has noticed Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s unusual appearance. A moment later, Lu Xueqi and Wen Min of xiaozhufeng also appeared in front of the crowd.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi glanced at Zhang Xiaofan and said to daoxuanzhen, &ldquo;Shifu asked me to come here with senior sister Wenmin! &quot;</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan sighed and shook his head slightly, but he didn&rsquo;t say anything, so he went forward.</p>
<p>Before they could go far, they could only hear the roar of thunder on the Yuqing hall behind them, and the flash of light like a mountain pillar rose to the sky. They broke the roof of the Yuqing hall and rushed straight to the sky, even made a few mixed screams. They didn&rsquo;t know who had lost his life?</p>
<p>Everyone lost color. I don&rsquo;t know how cruel the fierce duel in Yuqing hall is now. I have to worry about the same sect as my teacher. Immortal daoxuan gave a deep look at it. His face was tense. He suddenly shook his robe and strode away.</p>
<p>All the young disciples followed him, only to see the figure they admired as gods in the past. At the moment, his body is still as straight and tall as usual, but on the dark green robe, the blood soaked black group of shocking blood stains, even the sword hole left by Taoist Cangsong&rsquo;s plot, are very clear.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how this immortal daoxuan can survive such a serious injury. How could they support it?</p>
<p>When they passed through the back hall, none of the young disciples were long disciples, and no one had ever been here, just following immortal daoxuan. Gradually, the noise on the Yuqing hall was far away. They walked through the back hall of Yuqing hall, but towards the back mountain of Tongtian peak.</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan was the first to walk, and the people followed him closely. Watch carefully around. Although most of the disciples of the demon sect are attacking the front mountain at the moment, no one is sure that someone will also be led to the back mountain by Taoist Cangsong.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan walked behind the crowd, his eyes were red and his face was expressionless, but his heart was like the waves. He was shocked by the great difficulty of Qingyun gate and struggled with the blood feud of that year.</p>
<p>In his memory, although he did not see the murderer who killed the villagers of Caomiao village personally, he always recalled the scene of that day. Then I thought of the fierce mysterious man in black.</p>
<p>Now it seems that most of them are Taoist Cangsong!</p>
<p>Although there were two orphans in Caomiao village at that time, Zhang Xiaofan was the only one who saw the man in black fighting with the general wisdom. Once it was determined, the hatred for many years immediately spread to the heart. The fire stick, which was made by the blood eating and soul taking weapons in the world, was stimulated by the master&rsquo;s hatred and ferocity, and the deeply buried ferocity also spread, which in turn affected Zhang Xiaofan.</p>
<p>If you are in ordinary times, don&rsquo;t talk about the Taoism of immortal daoxuan. It&rsquo;s not easy for Tian to find something wrong with Zhang Xiaofan, but at the moment, no one has the heart to think about him. But no one knows that this little disciple of Qingyun sect is at a critical moment when his spirit is extremely fierce and heaven and man are fighting each other. If you are not careful, you will be infected by the blood sucking and soul sucking spirit. There is no end to it!</p>
<p>Sure enough, it turns out that Tian is not easy, Shuiyue and other people&rsquo;s concerns are not unreasonable. Although the mountain path behind the Tianfeng mountain is secluded, it is not far away. At that time, several disciples of demon sect rushed out from both sides, and Qi Hao and others immediately came to catch them.</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan only looked at it for a few times, but ignored it and went straight ahead. In this attack on Qingyun, the demon cult is indeed the best. Even the disciples who are here are also Taoists. Qi Hao, Lu Xueqi and others are eager to deal with them.</p>
<p>Song Daren and others continue to escort immortal daoxuan forward, leaving Qi Hao and Lu Xueqi to block the enemy. At this moment, there is a question in everyone&rsquo;s mind - immortal luoud doesn&rsquo;t fly away from the sky, is his injury so serious?</p>
<p>But no one dared to ask him at the moment. After a while, there was a crash, and several disciples of demon sect rushed out from both sides. Song Daren, Wen Min and Tian ling&rsquo;er stopped him. Zhang Xiaofan and Lin Jingyu also came forward. Song Daren said in a hurry, &ldquo;we three are enough. Go to protect the real leader! &quot;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu bites his teeth, grabs Zhang Xiaofan and runs forward to catch up with immortal daoxuan again. This time, he didn&rsquo;t meet the disciples of the demon sect again. Immortal daoxuan took them back to the mountain and walked along a quiet path for a while, then stopped at a three-way junction.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu and Zhang Xiaofan also stopped. Zhang Xiaofan didn&rsquo;t say a word, but Lin Jingyu looked up at Taoist immortal.</p>
<p>When immortal daoxuan looked back, he was suddenly stunned, and his face moved as if by coincidence. These two people happened to be the two orphans in Caomiao village.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After this place, it&rsquo;s the holy land of Qingyun Mountain, the magic moon cave. I want to go in. You are waiting here. No one from the demon sect is allowed to enter! The other way is to the ancestral hall. You</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu looked resolute, nodded heavily and said in a loud voice, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t worry, leader! &quot;</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan glanced at him, but then his eyes fell on the &ldquo;dragon cutting sword&rdquo; in his hand. He saw that in this quiet and clear mountain, the Dragon cutting sword was shining. What seemed to be yearning for?</p>
<p>The young man, full of passion and perseverance, suddenly turned around and looked at the road of the ancestral hall, then went straight to the other road.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu saw Taoist XuanZhen disappear on the path, and then turned around. His eyebrows were tightly wrinkled, his mind was hard to calm, and his breath was heavy. It&rsquo;s no wonder that Qingyun gate is suffering from a great disaster at the moment. However, Taoist Cangsong, who he always regarded as his father, suddenly rebelled. How could he not turn the world around.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan slowly raised his head and looked at the direction of Yuqing temple at the foot of the mountain in the distance, but he could only see the dense woods, not even the corner of the eaves of the temple. On the other way, he went to the ancestral hall. Behind the woods, there was a faint trace of the house and the sound of the bell and the tripod.</p>
<p>From the intense battlefield just now, suddenly to this quiet place, both of them are not suitable for a while. Lin Jingyu breathes heavily and slowly calms down his breathing.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, there was a roar of anger like a dragon&rsquo;s voice from the mountain. After such a long distance, the sound waves were still coming from the mountain. The sky and the earth changed a lot. Both of them were shocked. Lin Jingyu first responded and said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the spirit Buddha! &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan heard that. It was indeed the roar of water unicorn. Apparently, the spirit beast guarding the Qingyun Mountain for thousands of years in this town was finally moved.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not hard to imagine how fierce the battle situation of Qingyun gate is now!</p>
<p>Both of them have their own thoughts, waiting for immortal daoxuan here.</p>
<p>But their quiet time didn&rsquo;t last long. Suddenly, the footsteps began to sound. He was shocked. He thought that Qi Hao and others would be the best ones to arrive, otherwise</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, it seems that the heaven is also against Qingyun sect. After a while, there are five disciples of demon sect. The first one, who just calculated master Puhong&rsquo;s fake superior policy, saw them here and rushed over with a grim smile. Some of them looked behind them.</p>
<p>Lin and Zhang lose their color, and Lin Jingyu&rsquo;s mind turns sharply. Seeing these five people, he knows that they are not mediocre. Don&rsquo;t say whether they are the enemies of the five people. However, the immortal daoxuan behind can&rsquo;t let them in anyway. Under anxiety, he suddenly and ruthlessly makes a decision and whispers to Zhang Xiaofan, &ldquo;Xiaofan, I will lead them to another place One side, you stay here! &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was stunned. Before he knew it, Lin Jingyu had rushed out and killed the dragon and made it green. He mourned the five men in black, who were in great momentum.</p>
<p>Fake Shangguan CE and others frowned and were shocked. Their faces were solemn. Unexpectedly, the little disciple of Qingyun sect was so tall. They immediately surrounded them, leaving only one person to plunder the array, while paying attention to Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s movements.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu joined hands with them and proved that the disciples of these demon religions were not weak in their ways. Three of them were just inferior to him, but the first one was the same in their practice. At this time, four people besieged him and he was immediately in the downwind.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu frowned, not to mention being reluctant to fight, and immediately left for another fork in the road. As soon as the fake Shangguan strategic micro pondered, he took three people to chase him. A moment later, only one man in black and Zhang Xiaofan stood in the same place.</p>
<p>The man in black sneered and looked to Zhang Xiaofan. He saw that the young man seemed to hear something and raised his head slowly.</p>
<p>What appeared in front of him was a pair of blood red eyes filled with nameless ferocity!</p>
<p>In the quiet forest of Qingyun Mountain, all of a sudden, the birds fled and made a noise.</p>
<p>In the distance, there comes the roar of water unicorn, echoing between heaven and earth! (to be continued. )</p>
