      <p>&ldquo;Ha ha, younger martial brother Zhang!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly, Zhang Xiaofan was slapped heavily on the shoulder.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s whole attention is focused on Tian linger, who is going away. He doesn&rsquo;t notice the situation around him at all. He is shocked. The whole person jumps aside and looks at it in a twinkling of an eye, but it&rsquo;s Zeng Shushu that he just knew in the morning.</p>
<p>I saw Zeng Shushu smiling and relaxed, looking up and down at Zhang Xiaofan, and then my eyes moved to the monkey Xiaohui beside him.</p>
<p>Xiaohui sees that this disgusting guy runs over again. He looks like the boss doesn&rsquo;t want to. He grins and makes a face. He turns around and jumps on the back of rhubarb. He pats the dog&rsquo;s head. Rhubarb glares at Zhang Xiaofan and Zeng Shushu, barks twice, and runs away.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan frowned and cried, &ldquo;Xiaohui, come back, don&rsquo;t run around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu said with a smile, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t be afraid. The three eyed monkey is very smart and won&rsquo;t lose it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan shrugged his shoulders, turned around, was about to talk to Zeng Shushu. Suddenly, he felt a movement in his heart. Looking around, he saw that rhubarb was running to the kitchen with little ash on his back. He rattled in his heart and lost his voice: &ldquo;ah, dead monkey, you go again&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu said: &ldquo;how?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan coughs and laughs: &ldquo;no, it&rsquo;s OK. By the way, elder martial brother Zeng, don&rsquo;t you want to take part in the competition, how can you come to me when you have time? &quot;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu said with a smile, &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve finished the contest. I have nothing to do. When I see you here, I&rsquo;ll come and say hello.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was surprised and said, &ldquo;what, you have finished the contest, and what is the result?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushou&rsquo;s fan brushes together and rubs against his black hair on his head, saying, &ldquo;well, I won by accident, hehe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan looked at him casually, not like he had experienced a big fight at all. He asked cautiously, &ldquo;elder martial brother Zeng, do you have a high level of cultivation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu immediately shook his hand and said, &ldquo;Oh, what do you say, younger martial brother Zhang? Where can I get the scene with my little practice? If my father didn&rsquo;t force me to practice all the time, I would be too lazy to practice Taoism. I would raise flowers and feed birds and read books every day. What kind of free life would it be! But then, &ldquo;he put his hand on Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s shoulder, took him forward, and whispered,&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t expect that there was anyone worse than me in the martial arts test of the seven channels. &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan smiled bitterly and said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s much worse than you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu shrugs his shoulders and doesn&rsquo;t care about the tunnel: &ldquo;how about more? Anyway, I can&rsquo;t hope to win the final game even if I&rsquo;m greedy. But I&rsquo;m very interested in your three eyed monkey. Hey, younger martial brother Zhang, why don&rsquo;t you take it&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Zhang Xiaofan saw his face, he immediately said, &ldquo;elder martial brother Zeng, don&rsquo;t give me any idea!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu once smothers his eyes and says: &ldquo;then I&rsquo;ll exchange things with you. You don&rsquo;t know. I have kept many interesting and strange things on Fenghui peak, such as three legged rabbit, black and white peacock, turtle without shell and snake with wings&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan couldn&rsquo;t help saying, &ldquo;there are so many strange things?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shu&rsquo;s writing got better and said, &ldquo;well, in order to collect these treasures, I didn&rsquo;t spend less time and get scolded by my father. But I also like your three eyed monkey. How about that? What do you like? I&rsquo;ll exchange it for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan shook his head and said, &ldquo;no, I raise Xiaohui only to see that it is related to me. Besides, you give me those black and white rabbits, peacocks without shells and so on&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu immediately corrected: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a three legged rabbit, a black and white peacock, and a turtle without a shell!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan put out his tongue and said, &ldquo;Oh, yes, yes, but I&rsquo;m not interested in those. I&rsquo;m not going to change them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu&rsquo;s eyes turned again. He pulled Zhang Xiaofan to a remote place and looked around. His face was weird and he whispered, &ldquo;younger martial brother Zhang, do you like it or not Said to touch a thick blue cover book from the bosom, handed to Zhang Xiaofan.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan took a look, but saw that there was not even a name on the book, and the cover was old, it seems that it has been quite a long time. Look at the appearance of Zeng&rsquo;s book again. On the surface, it seems to be doing nothing, but a pair of smart eyes are constantly looking around. It&rsquo;s very alert. The originally beautiful face now looks a little weird or even obscene. It seems that this book is not recording the peerless formula, it&rsquo;s a rare book.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan shook his head and said, &ldquo;elder martial brother Zeng, I can&rsquo;t stand this kind of precious book. Moreover, I have poor qualifications. It&rsquo;s useless to use it. I don&rsquo;t want to use small ashes to exchange it. Please put it away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu glared at him and said in a low voice, &ldquo;if you don&rsquo;t read, just say so. First look, quickly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan looked strange, but he was also curious about the book. When he opened it, his face was red and his ears were red. In addition to a large number of words, there were many pictures in the thick book, but the pictures were red, naked, hugged and rubbed by men and women, which turned out to be a spring, palace, picture and book. Zhang Xiaofan saw this kind of thing for the first time in his life. However, the painting style in this book is exquisite and the characters are lifelike. His heart leaped and he said: &ldquo;elder martial brother Zeng, how can you, you and you have this kind of thing&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shh!&rdquo; Zeng Shushu was startled and rushed to grab the book and put it into his arms. Then he carefully looked at his disciples walking around and stared at Zhang Xiaofan and said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t be so loud.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan woke up, but he was still shocked and said in a low voice: &ldquo;elder martial brother Zeng, how could you have, er, read such books?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once the book mouth corner a sip, way: &ldquo;read how, tell you, this is a wonderful book, hear or alone! I don&rsquo;t know how much effort it took to get it. I promise that after you see it, you will be proud of the flowers and win the hearts of women in the world. How about using it to replace your little ash&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan immediately shook his head and said, &ldquo;no way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu said angrily, &ldquo;neither this nor that, but you tell me what you want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want anything,&rdquo; said Zhang</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu had no choice but to spit: &ldquo;how can you be like a piece of wood?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan laughed and didn&rsquo;t care, but his eyes drifted to the distance involuntarily. There was a faint white cloud and the beautiful figure was looming.</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu&rsquo;s heart died. He closed the book and opened the fan again with a swipe. After two strokes, he only heard the chime of bells and tripods in the distance. It seemed that another contest had begun.</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu glanced at the place, smiled suddenly, pulled Zhang Xiaofan, and said, &ldquo;go, I&rsquo;ll show you the most popular person in Qingyun gate in this big test.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was shocked and said, &ldquo;who is it?&rdquo; After a pause, his face suddenly darkened, and he said, &ldquo;is it elder martial brother Qihao from longshoufeng?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu said &ldquo;eh&rdquo;. Looking at Zhang Xiaofan, he was a little surprised, but he shook his head and said: &ldquo;elder martial brother Qi&rsquo;s cultivation is very famous, but you haven&rsquo;t heard of it. This time, another person is the most noticeable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan thought for a long time, or said, &ldquo;who is that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu seems to have forgotten the dispute just now in a moment. With a smile on his face, he said mysteriously: &ldquo;if you come with me, you will know!&rdquo; As he spoke, he pulled Zhang Xiaofan forward. Zhang Xiaofan could not help but be curious about the so-called mysterious figure and followed him.</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu leads Zhang Xiaofan straight to the biggest &ldquo;Qian&rdquo; arena in the eight challenge arenas. Zhang Xiaofan follows him and looks at it. Under that stage, the disciples of Qingyun sect are crowded. It seems that there are at least four or five hundred of them. Zhang Xiaofan has made a little calculation in his mind. It is estimated that at least half of them are Qingyun disciples in the square Most of the younger generation of male students gathered here.</p>
<p>When they got close to each other, they only heard the sound of the noise getting louder and louder. All around were the cheery voices of Qingyun disciples.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Xiaozhufeng has always been rich in beautiful women. It&rsquo;s said that this time, Lu Xueqi is known as the best beauty in 500 years!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw her in the Yuqing hall that day. She is really a great country&hellip; Ah, who hit me on the head&hellip; Eh, martial uncle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>An old man with white beard angrily said beside him: &ldquo;you are a real man, you should be calm, how can you still be so greedy for beauty? If I let you on the stage, I can&rsquo;t just look at that face. I&rsquo;ll lose before I start! &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip; yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hum, so I told the first elder martial brother that we should not accept female apprentices because of the misfortune of beauties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>　　&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cough, martial uncle, you are really, er, wise and wise, but are you speaking too loudly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter? Am I wrong?&rdquo; The old man with white beard blew his beard and stared, his voice was a little higher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; the young disciples quickly surrounded him and whispered after smiling, &ldquo;uncle, master Shuiyue is sitting in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo; he lowered his voice, and the old leader said, &ldquo;hum, I would have been&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the disciples said together that they praised the old man for his high cultivation and broad mind, and didn&rsquo;t care about the younger generation.</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu and Zhang Xiaofan look at each other. Zeng Shushu shrugs his shoulders. Zhang Xiaofan whispers to him, &ldquo;is that the elder martial sister of xiaozhufeng you are talking about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu nodded, looked at the platform, and said: &ldquo;it hasn&rsquo;t started yet. You will know her fame later. However, alas, there are so many people here. &quot;</p>
<p>During the conversation, the two turned around, but they were still circling around the outside of the crowd. The inner part of the group had been crowded to the brim by the level of Qingyun disciples, who could not even insert the needle. Zhang Xiaofan is more and more curious. It seems that this mysterious figure is really popular. So many Qingyun disciples are attracted.</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu&rsquo;s face was full of anxiety. He kept saying, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s terrible. There&rsquo;s no good place. I knew that I should have come here last night to line up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was surprised, but he didn&rsquo;t say anything. Suddenly, he saw dozens of fenghuifeng disciples standing in front of him. Without saying anything, he pulled Zhang Xiaofan up and rushed to them. The disciples of fenghuifeng all saw Zeng Shushu and smiled. One of the tall men said with a smile, &ldquo;ha ha, it&rsquo;s late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu ignores him and pushes Zhang Xiaofan in. It&rsquo;s obvious that fenghuifeng disciples are very good at Zeng Shushu. They all move aside, and Zhang Xiaofan also pushes in. Soon after, they got into the inner circle. As expected, they had a good sight here. There were seven or eight people sitting closest to the challenge arena. Immortal daoxuan, the leader of Qingyun sect, Taoist Cangsong, the first Taoist of longshoufeng, and master Shuiyue, the first master of xiaozhufeng, were all present. Most of the other elders were also famous elders of each vein. Behind them, the disciples of Qingyun are all standing. The most attractive disciples of xiaozhufeng are all behind the master Shuiyue. Wenmin, whom Zhang Xiaofan knows, is also among them. The closest one to master Shuiyue is the girl in blue when she drew lots on the Yuqing hall yesterday. At the moment, she is still cold and beautiful, attracting countless eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See? It&rsquo;s her.&rdquo; Zeng Shushu stabbed Zhang Xiaofan with his arm to show him the woman in blue.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan looked at the woman a few more eyes and whispered, &ldquo;she is the big hit you said?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu looks intoxicated and says: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not necessarily popular. It&rsquo;s said that Lu Xueqi didn&rsquo;t have a long time to get started. Her accomplishments are unpredictable, but everyone says that if it comes to beauty, it&rsquo;s her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan frowned and said, &ldquo;elder martial brother Zeng, your drooling looks very indecent!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu: &ldquo;&hellip; Cough, do I and I have it? Hey, you must have read it wrong. By the way, look around at our fellow disciples? &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan looked around and saw that among the young generation of Qingyun disciples around him, most of them focused on the beautiful women in xiaozhufeng, especially the blue clad woman Lu Xueqi. However, it seems that those beauties have been used to it for a long time. They look self-confident, and Lu Xueqi is even more expressionless and cold, as if she is indifferent to the same male disciples behind her.</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu swallowed his saliva and said to Zhang Xiaofan in a low voice: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s no wonder that Qingyun gate has suddenly recruited young disciples. Look around, there are at least three or four hundred people of our age. Haha, if we don&rsquo;t have deep cultivation, we will be easily tempted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan glanced at him sideways, only to see that Zeng Shushu&rsquo;s originally beautiful face seemed to have changed its taste at this time. Recalling the book just now, he only felt that Zeng Shushu&rsquo;s forehead seemed to have written a &ldquo;color&rdquo; character.</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu turned around and was surprised. &ldquo;Younger martial brother Zhang, why don&rsquo;t you see that they always look at me? I fell in love with you. When you were friends, you came to see them. By the way, which one of them has the best figure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan immediately turned around and added a word &ldquo;wolf&rdquo; after his comments on Zeng&rsquo;s books.</p>
<p>At this time, all the noise suddenly quieted down. Under the public&rsquo;s attention, Lu Xueqi took a step forward and saluted master Shuiyue sitting on the chair. Master Shuiyue nodded lightly and said, &ldquo;go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi should, a whole body lapel, right hand gently grasp the formula, a pair of bright eyes to look at that stage.</p>
<p>At the moment, the light cloud at the white jade slate under her feet suddenly whirled and gathered from all directions. Soon, a white cloud group formed at the foot of Lu Xueqi. Then, Lu Xueqi was like a fairy. The whole person rose slowly and slowly in the white cloud and moved to the stage.</p>
<p>When the mountain wind blows, the white cloud moves gently like the most soft and beautiful silk, Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s clothes float, the skin color is like snow, and the pure and gorgeous things are irresistible, just like nine heaven fairies falling into the world, when people love them, they still have some awe.</p>
<p>A moment later, Zhang Xiaofan was caught off guard by the thunderous applause, the roar of the mountain and the tsunami, and the roar of the sound. He was shocked by the buzz in his ears. Unexpectedly, Lu Xueqi was so popular. However, it was the beautiful figure he saw in the middle of the sky, which was still fascinating and hard to control. It was hard to imagine that the world was so beautiful People.</p>
<p>The master Shuiyue, who is sitting under the stage, has been indifferent all the time. Now he also has a smile.</p>
<p>After a while, a young disciple who didn&rsquo;t know where to go to the challenge Arena (because no one paid attention to him at all) had a thick eyebrow on his face and a proper appearance, but he was quite excited. Once on the stage, he said to Lu Xueqi, &ldquo;sister Lu, I&rsquo;m Fang Chao, a disciple of longshoufeng. I&rsquo;m very lucky to compete with her today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shh!&rdquo; There were boos all over the stage.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi, expressionless, said coldly in the middle of the air, &ldquo;elder martial brother Fang is polite. Lu Xueqi, the eighth generation disciple of xiaozhufeng, is asking for advice from elder martial brother Fang today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan stood under the stage and looked at Lu Xueqi, who was standing in the air like a fairy. Suddenly, he felt a pain. Just now, elder martial sister ling&rsquo;er was standing in the air like this. In a trance, Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s figure seemed to coincide with Tian linger&rsquo;s model.</p>
<p>At the moment, Fang Chao on the stage is still chattering. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if he can keep on talking like this until the end of time. Fortunately, most of his opponents are in the world. Before he can say a few words, countless people, including Zeng Shushu, who is standing beside Zhang Xiaofan, say angrily, &ldquo;haven&rsquo;t you started yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lecher!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chirp, just like a woman! &hellip; eh, elder martial sister of xiaozhufeng, ah, what do you do? No, I have absolutely no other meaning&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The final bell and tripod of the decisive battle finally rang. Lu Xueqi looked cold and looked directly at Fang Chao. Fang Chao felt cold all over when she looked at her cold eyes. Although from here, even Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s face was still cold, he dared not talk or laugh any more. He quickly put away his smile, straightened his mind, drew the formula of his right hand, and sacrificed a silver white fairy sword.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan frowned, and couldn&rsquo;t help but think of Qi Hao&rsquo;s fairy sword &ldquo;cold ice&rdquo;. At this time, he only listened to Zeng Shushu&rsquo;s sudden hum and whispered: &ldquo;the people of dragon head peak have Qi Hao as an example, and they all like to cultivate this kind of fairy sword.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s eyes flickered and looked around. He saw his head moving, but he couldn&rsquo;t find Qi Hao&rsquo;s shadow in any case, let alone the one he wanted to see most in his heart but didn&rsquo;t want to see at the moment.</p>
<p>Where did they go? Zhang Xiaofan bowed his head and felt a sadness in his heart.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Zeng Shuyi pulled his arm and said happily, &ldquo;Xiaofan, look, it&rsquo;s beginning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan raised his eyes and looked up to the stage. He saw that Fang Chao had already sacrificed the immortal sword, and the air was cold on the table. However, in Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s eyes, he intuitively found that compared with Qi Hao, who was not easy to fight in Hotan, Fang Chao obviously had a gap in driving out the ice fairy.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi, on the other hand, is still standing on the floating cloud with no expression, watching Fang Chao freezing in front of her. It seems that she has no intention of attacking. Behind her is a fairy sword with a sky blue scabbard. Although this fairy sword does not fit in with the master like most people&rsquo;s Fairy swords, no one dares to despise it from Fang Chao on the stage to all Qingyun disciples under the stage.</p>
<p>In the cultivation way, the channeling magic weapon can be combined with the master after the master has practiced for a long time. It is very convenient to sacrifice it when it is used.</p>
<p>But some strange magic weapons, because of their own spiritual strength, the human body can not afford to do this, can only be carried by the master. But this kind of magic weapon is often the most powerful treasure of the immortal family. The deeper the master&rsquo;s cultivation is, the more amazing the power he exerts. The most valuable treasure of Qingyun gate, the ancient sword &ldquo;Zhuxian&rdquo;, belongs to this type.</p>
<p>At this moment, on the challenge arena, in the three Zhangs around Fang Chao, there is thin ice on the table. The disciples close to him, such as Zhang Xiaofan, Zeng Shushu and so on, feel a cool air coming to their faces. But Lu Xueqi, who was still in the middle of the air, seemed to be indifferent to this, just looking at Fang Chao coldly.</p>
<p>Fang Chao is singing a monologue in full view of the public. The sword is flying. It&rsquo;s OK to look at it hundreds of times in the corner of his eyes. But Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s eyes seem to be colder than the cold air emanating from his sword. It&rsquo;s cold to his heart. He almost has a feeling of hands and feet.</p>
<p>Fang Chao&rsquo;s heart was a little anxious. At the moment, he pointed to the sword Jue of his right hand, and the silver white fairy sword shot at Lu Xueqi from the bottom up. He shouted, &ldquo;younger martial sister Lu, be careful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a burst of laughter in the crowd under the stage. Looking at Fang Chao&rsquo;s appearance, I was afraid that Lu Xueqi would be hurt. Taoist Cangsong sat under the stage looked rather ugly and snorted heavily.</p>
<p>With disdain in the hum, he fell into the ear of a man beside him, and immediately responded: &ldquo;why, elder martial brother Cangsong seems to be dissatisfied?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taoist Cangsong didn&rsquo;t turn his head. He said lightly, &ldquo;sister Shuiyue, your disciples are really gorgeous!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as master Shuiyue&rsquo;s face changed, in this contest, Taoist Cangsong didn&rsquo;t praise her disciples for their practice but praised the beauty of all the women. It was obvious that there was a sense of ridicule. As soon as master Shuiyue&rsquo;s eyebrows stood up, he said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that there are so many disciples, prodigals and lecherous people under the cultivation of Qingyun gate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taoist Cangsong was furious and was about to refute. Taoist XuanZhen, sitting in the middle of them, raised his hand and smiled: &ldquo;well, well, all of them are hundreds of years old. They are not afraid to lose face when they quarrel in front of so many disciples. See the competition, see the competition. &quot;</p>
<p>Both of the first seats snorted heavily and turned their heads.</p>
<p>Fang Chao&rsquo;s silver white fairy sword has been shot at the cloud under Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s feet at the moment. Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s indifferent face has no expression, and she can&rsquo;t see how she moves. The cloud under her feet carries her body back, but Fang Chao&rsquo;s fairy sword is faster. In a blink of an eye, it has caught up with her, and the audience immediately screams and sighs.</p>
<p>At this time, Lu Xueqi turned her back and took the sword behind her. She saw that her jade face was like frost, and she did not pull out her sword, but only used the sky blue sword in front of her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zheng!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The clear echo reverberated far above the square, which was very pleasant.</p>
<p>Fang Chao&rsquo;s silver white immortal sword, like being hit hard, bounced back. The Taoist Cangsong above the stage and under the stage changed his face. In the eyes of all the people, Lu Xueqi did not hesitate at all. After a little pink on her white face, she threw out the sky blue sword with its scabbard and five fingers of her right hand. She tightly grasped the formula. On that day, the blue fairy sword suddenly shone in the middle of the sky. The blue light covered the whole huge challenge arena. It was obviously not ordinary.</p>
<p>Fang Chao did not dare to neglect it. He was surprised to see the blue light coming from the sky. At the same time, he was even angry at Lu Xueqi who didn&rsquo;t even go out of his sheath and despised him so much. However, he still urged the immortal sword in his hand, and in a twinkling of an eye, three ice walls were formed in front of him, sending out a chill.</p>
<p>In the middle of the sky, Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s eyes are as bright as stars, and her black hair and skirt are fluttering in the strong wind. Her demeanor is peerless and moving. In her mouth, she seemed to recite the mantra in a low voice. There was no expression on her cold face. With her gaze, people could only see a loud sound on the magic sword that was flying in the middle of the sky. It was like the roar of a fierce beast. The sound shook all the fields. In a moment, the blue light was very strong. The magic sword broke through the sky, the Dragon came out of the abyss, and all the clouds within ten feet were all covered in a moment It was forced to dissipate without trace.</p>
<p>Among the thousands of blue lights, in the place where the deepest blue is as blue as the sky, the fairy sword comes from the sky, shoots fast and rushes to Fang Chao. It&rsquo;s powerful for a moment.</p>
<p>Fang Chao&rsquo;s face is dignified and sweat drips on his forehead. He is obviously shocked by Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s great power. Only in a moment, the sword has rushed to the front.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ka, Ka, Ka!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Among hundreds of Qingyun disciples, Fang Chao&rsquo;s three frozen walls, like tofu, were smashed by the blue fairy sword.</p>
<p>Fang Da Da Jing, with his strength, is not able to condense more ice walls as a defense, but with his original intention of three ice walls is enough. Unexpectedly, Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s road trip is so high and deep, and the blue fairy sword is even more unexpectedly powerful. In a twinkling of an eye, he came to the front.</p>
<p>At this time of life and death, Fang Chao managed to stabilize his mind and spirit. The silver white fairy sword flashed with light. He held his body and sacrificed the white light shield. A moment later, Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s blue fairy sword has been collided with the white light shield.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boom!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The loud sound is like thunder in the sky. The huge and invisible shock wave takes these two swords as the center and spreads around quickly. All the Qingyun disciples standing under the stage feel the strong wind, and the whole body moves backward involuntarily. The whole crowd circle around the stage also expands backward at the same time.</p>
<p>Everyone turned pale and was shocked by the power of the immortal magic weapon.</p>
<p>After that moment&rsquo;s exclamation, everyone&rsquo;s eyes went back to the challenge arena. Lu Xueqi did not know when he had fallen to the arena. The fairy sword and its scabbard flew back to her hands. The blue light and white light gradually disappeared, but everyone found that Fang Chao&rsquo;s face was as gray as death.</p>
<p>Fang Chao raised his head slowly and pointed to Lu Xueqi. His voice became hoarse for some reason. He said, &ldquo;you&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everyone wondered, did not know what happened, and suddenly changed. The silver fairy sword, which had been stopped in front of Fang Chao&rsquo;s body since just now, suddenly made a few muffled sounds on the sword. Then, under the eyes of countless people, a crack suddenly appeared on the sword body, and then it expanded rapidly. A moment later, the fairy sword made a painful sound, &ldquo;Dong&rdquo; for a while It broke in two and fell on the stage.</p>
<p>There was silence on and off the stage, and everyone held their breath.</p>
<p>What does the immortal sword mean to a man of practice for a long time? No one on this sea of clouds is unclear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow&rdquo;, on the stage, Fang Chao spewed out a mouthful of blood, stroked his chest with his hands, and his face was painful. He could not support it any more and fell to the ground and fainted.</p>
