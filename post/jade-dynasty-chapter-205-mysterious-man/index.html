      <p>Zhongtu, outside Heyang City, abandoned village.</p>
<p>Above the wilderness, at a glance, the terrain is relatively flat. In addition to looking northward, there is such a towering Qingyun Mountain range in the distance, and there are few rolling hills in other directions. Far and near, there are a lot of woods, large or small, distributed on this field. Around the villa, there are also a few sparse trees standing.</p>
<p>The sky is the darkest time, and the sky is very thick, blocking the moon, only a few small stars at the edge of the light, shining on the desolate land. This night, the wind rose, not particularly strong, but it blew through the branches of the tree tops, the branches swayed, the dark shadows flashed, and made a &ldquo;rustling&rdquo; low voice. Listening to it and blowing on my body, I felt very cold.</p>
<p>Monday fairy, Xiao Huan and wild dog Taoist stood closely together, staring at the mysterious figure in front of him. It was a long time since Monday fairy found the man, but the man seemed like a zombie. He still stood there, but he blocked the door, but the three people couldn&rsquo;t get out on Monday.</p>
<p>Xiaohuan calmed down his voice and whispered to the immortal on Monday: &ldquo;grandfather, do you really see clearly that what he is wearing is the Taoist robe of Qingyun gate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wild dog Taoist also turned to listen.</p>
<p>Monday fairy took a look at the wooden figure, then determined the location and said: &ldquo;it can&rsquo;t be wrong. Look at the sword shaped sign on his cuff, it&rsquo;s the Qingyun gate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Huan muttered: &ldquo;Qingyun gate is not all noble and decent. Where can you go to such a ghost place in the middle of the night to frighten people?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wild dog Taoist also nodded. It was obvious that even though he had never been fond of the right way, he did not believe that the disciples of Qingyun sect would do such things.</p>
<p>On Monday, they both looked white and coughed. Anyway, although they were shocked when they first found the figure, it took a little longer. Although the strange figure was still mysterious, it did not do anything to hurt them or be hostile. On Monday, the immortal&rsquo;s courage could not help being bigger.</p>
<p>He took a step slowly, chuckled twice and said, &ldquo;this This With all due respect, sir. We don&rsquo;t know that this is your residence&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grandfather Small ring in the back called a, interrupted Monday fairy&rsquo;s words, tone in the microstrip angry. And the figure in front of me suddenly moved a bit, as if to respond to the words of Monday immortal.</p>
<p>Zhou Yixian frowned, but immediately responded. This is a righteous villa. If I say that this is the residence of this man, is it not to curse the dead and live ghosts in person</p>
<p>Monday fairy couldn&rsquo;t help but feel cold for a while, and quickly said with a smile: &ldquo;this, this I mean, we took a walk in the middle of the night. We didn&rsquo;t mean to come here by mistake. Sir, don&rsquo;t mind. We didn&rsquo;t see anything. We didn&rsquo;t see anything. We&rsquo;re going. We&rsquo;re going. &quot;</p>
<p>After that, he turned his head and winked at Xiao Huan and the wild dog Taoist. The three hardened their heads and slowly leaned to the side, trying to walk past the ghost like figure. Unexpectedly, only a few steps later, the three people just feel a flower in front of them, and the black figure stands in front of them again, and the distance is closer. Xiaohuan even vaguely smells a bloody smell on the man.</p>
<p>Looking up at the dark moon above my head. In front of him, a dark shadow swept over. Zhou Yixian and the wild dog Taoist priest changed color for it. Xiao Huan turned white and cried out. He jumped back a few steps, hoping to get as far away from the shadow as possible.</p>
<p>Small ring a cry, although it is their own fear of subconscious call out, originally! Girls always hate these things, but they listen to them. It&rsquo;s a different story. Zhouxian and the wild dog Taoist priest were both startled. Zhouxian quickly looked back, but the wild dog Taoist did not know where the courage came from, a tiger roar Well, it&rsquo;s more like a dog barking. He jumps out and blocks Xiaohuan and Zhouxian in front of him. At the same time, the halo in his hand flashes, and he has sacrificed his magic weapon of beast teeth.</p>
<p>In the dark night, although the light yellow halo is weak, it seems that it is still warm.</p>
<p>Xiaohuan saw the wild dog Taoist like this, but he was also scared. He didn&rsquo;t know why. In that moment, the figure, whose face had been shrouded in the shadow, suddenly shook.</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s hand went straight forward, and a strange breath came up, but it was not the aboveboard way of Qingyun gate. The wild dog Taoist knew that this man was unpredictable, but behind him was a woman standing. However, she could not step back. At the next roar, the magic weapon of beast teeth was shining brightly and hit the man.</p>
<p>In the courtyard of Yizhuang, the darkness seemed to be driven away by the wild dog Taoist priest in an instant. In his face, for a moment, seeing the figure seemed to be unstoppable, he was also a little surprised and even more pleased.</p>
<p>At the next moment, Taoist wild dog&rsquo;s magic weapon of beast teeth hit the figure&rsquo;s chest. The mysterious and powerful figure did not dodge the heavy blow of Taoist wild dog.</p>
<p>Taoist yegou couldn&rsquo;t believe it. Next to him, the immortal and the little ring were stunned for a moment. They saw the magic weapon Huang Guangyao in front of him, which had the spirit of a winner. Only a moment later, the three men immediately found out that it was wrong.</p>
<p>The man who was hit by Taoist wild dog and hit him in the chest did not seem to shake his body for a few times. Although the Taoist priest of wild dog is far from comparable with the ghosts and sharp figures, he is also a demon cult figure who has practiced for many years. The power of this blow is also extraordinary. Ordinary people are afraid that they will be beaten and their blood will roll and even die.</p>
<p>Then, a moment later, the man snorted, and the Taoist priest of wild dog suddenly exclaimed. He did not see how the man acted. The hand that stretched out immediately returned to his body and grasped the magic weapon of Taoist wild dog&rsquo;s teeth in his hand.</p>
<p>It is very dangerous for the practitioners to master their own magic weapons. How can Taoist wild dog not be so anxious and angry as to urge his magic power with all his strength to call back the magic weapon. Unexpectedly, the tooth of the beast lay in the man&rsquo;s hand, and he could not see how hard he exerted himself. He had no response to his master&rsquo;s magic power.</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s head was low, looked at the object in his hand, and then opened his mouth for the first time. His voice was hoarse and almost hard to hear, but he said coldly with a tone of obvious disdain: &ldquo;demon path, dare to be presumptuous here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wild dog Taoist is frightened and angry. Just to urge the magic weapon again, he suddenly heard Monday fairy behind him saying: &ldquo;back off, back off&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wild dog Taoist startled, instinct back a few steps. Just wanted to ask the immortal Monday, the man&rsquo;s palm suddenly tightened, and the beast tooth magic weapon almost responded with a piercing sound of &ldquo;KaKa&rdquo; like broken bones. The wild dog Taoist was scared and frightened, but the yellow light rose sharply and disappeared immediately. &ldquo;KaKa&rdquo; sound, such as a beast in the end * *, painful struggle.</p>
<p>With the sound of &ldquo;bang&rdquo;, Taoist wild dog&rsquo;s magic weapon teeth were crushed by the man with his bare hands. The fragments shot out like a knife. The sound of &ldquo;aggressive&rdquo; was heard all the time, hitting the place where the Taoist priest was just standing.</p>
<p>Wild dog Taoist is heartache and fear. He couldn&rsquo;t speak for a moment.</p>
<p>The face of that strange figure is still shrouded in a mysterious shadow. The three people can&rsquo;t see his face clearly. They only listen to his low voice and look up at the sky slowly. However, the dark shadow on his face is still unspeakable. After destroying the teeth of the beast, he seemed to have a sense of catharsis, and slowly sneered, listening to the strange villa. The wind was blowing all over the sky, and the three people, including Monday immortal, had a creepy feeling.</p>
<p>On Monday, the immortal was in a state of uneasiness. Suddenly, he looked at the strange man&rsquo;s arm. I can see that the hand that crushed the animal&rsquo;s teeth has been covered with a light blue color. However, the blue light is quite different from the person&rsquo;s whole body breath. It is pure and gentle, and it is the pure Taoist realm.</p>
<p>Monday fairy looked up in amazement and took a step. For a moment, he forgot to worry, and ignored Xiao Huan and wild dog. The Taoist priest was surprised and said, &ldquo;who is your name? Who is the master of Qingyun gate who is dressed in the Taoist robe of Qingyun gate and cultivates Taiji Xuanqing Dao which is no lower than that in Shangqing state? Who is the master of Qingyun gate who is doing such absurd things at such a time? &quot;</p>
<p>The blue light flashed away. The man slowly looked at him. Through the mysterious black air on his face, Zhou Yixian felt a chill all over his body.</p>
<p>Only listen to that person hoarse voice, coldly way: &ldquo;you know can many ah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Monday immortal snorted, his face was dignified, and he could not help looking at the man. His face became more and more confused. He said in a deep voice: &ldquo;you are indeed under the Qingyun sect, and certainly not an ordinary disciple. But who are you and why are you doing this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man sneered, but he didn&rsquo;t answer. Zhouxian suddenly felt something. Looking back, he gently pulled his sleeve and said in a low voice: &ldquo;grandfather, he is full of ghost. I can feel that there is no ghost wandering around the villa. I&rsquo;m afraid all of them are scared to run away. If not, I would have known that this place was not right. How can a person like this belong to Qingyun gate? &quot;</p>
<p>Zhou Yixian&rsquo;s face is uncertain and complicated. Obviously, his mind is also a little confused. Facing this mysterious figure, he has countless connections with Qingyun gate. He doesn&rsquo;t seem to be as scared as usual, and some of his thoughts are out of his mind.</p>
<p>The strange figure&rsquo;s attention at the moment was slowly focused on Monday immortal. He looked at him up and down, and suddenly sneered and said in a cold voice: &ldquo;whoever you are, you will die if you dare to disobey me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a word, his hand was lifted up. The blue light in his heart lit up in the eyes of Monday immortal, and his old face turned pale. He could not even speak. He suddenly waved his hands together and raised them to his chest. A piece of yellow Rune paper appeared between his forefinger and middle finger. It was crooked and crooked with strange charms, flying slightly in the wind.</p>
<p>The blue light in the palm of the mysterious figure gradually became bright, and aimed at Zhou Yixian and others. Zhouyi Xian did not hesitate, but murmured and chanted a mantra. Instead, he stepped forward and took a step. With the sound of the incantation in his mouth, the two pieces of yellow Rune paper actually started to burn by themselves. Two small flames appeared suddenly in the dark night, which was particularly bright.</p>
<p>This strange action seemed to make the mysterious man opposite him hesitant, or touched his memory. He even stopped his action for a moment, and vaguely heard him utter a surprised &ldquo;Yi&rdquo;.</p>
<p>When the paper was burned, the white beard of the immortal was flying. Suddenly, he gave a big drink and threw his hands. The two flames flew out of his fingers, and they were coagulated in the air. Then, with a big bang, two small flames rose against the wind and turned into a huge fire several feet in size, blocking the middle of Monday immortal and the mysterious man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roar!&rdquo; There was a roar in the air. Out of the blazing flames, a giant tiger with white forehead leaped out. The tiger became powerful. It opened its mouth and let out a powerful roar of tigers. It jumped up in a roar. To the shadow man.</p>
<p>The mysterious man snorted coldly, but he didn&rsquo;t give in a little. The green light of his right hand flashed, and he chopped down. No matter how ferocious the giant tiger was, the palm of the tiger fell on the tiger&rsquo;s forehead. The blue light invades and goes in an instant. The white tiger seems to struggle, and starts to dance, but after a moment. After sending out the last unwilling roar, the whole body of the giant tiger suddenly showed blue light everywhere, and then a burst of shaking, the huge body turned into a few residual flames, twinkled twice in the air, and disappeared in the invisible.</p>
<p>Almost at the same time when the giant tiger disappeared, a red maned lion appeared in the huge flame. The lion roared. Come again to the mysterious man.</p>
<p>However, the mysterious man was obviously extremely good at Taoism. He almost didn&rsquo;t even look at the front eye and split it with the same palm. The lion&rsquo;s fate was similar to that of a giant tiger with white forehead.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that the magic of Monday immortal is really strange. Although the giant beast that appears in the illusion can&rsquo;t resist the attack of the enemy, there are many strange beasts with magic power in the blazing fire. After the giant tiger and lion, there are more and more fierce animals, such as wild boar, leopard, hippopotamus, giant elephant, deer, bobcat and so on. He emerged in endlessly, and his body was majestic, extraordinary and ferocious.</p>
<p>But the mysterious man I&rsquo;m facing this time. However, it seems that there is really a supernatural power and Taoism. In the face of the numerous monsters coming one after another, he does not breathe a breath. He just seems to wave his arms at will, and the fierce beast will become invisible.</p>
<p>Fighting. Suddenly, the mysterious man snorted coldly, as if aware of it. Suddenly, he changed his palms to sweeping. All of a sudden, the blue light was flourishing, and a bright color was like a wheel. It rolled over the past with great momentum and momentum. The flaming flame met the blue light column, resisted twice, and was finally pierced and penetrated.</p>
<p>In the middle of the sky, it seems that there are ten thousand animals roaring in unison, but then the ears are gone, the flame disappears, and the fire is flickering. Only two groups of yellow runes that are about to burn out slowly fall down from the air.</p>
<p>On the other side of the courtyard, the three men of Monday fairy who had just slipped to the corner of the wall and wanted to run away were stunned. Apparently, they did not expect that the enemy could break the magic of Monday immortal so quickly.</p>
<p>Without illusions, it was obviously ridiculous and stupid to run away with his back. The three men, such as Zhouxian, slowly turned back. But that mysterious person slowly deceives the body to approach, slowly walked over, the black figure takes the thick murderous spirit, in the righteousness village, one is killing.</p>
<p>Zhou Yixian frowned, obviously worried about something, but saw the black figure getting closer and closer, but only felt that life and death were in the breath.</p>
<p>Xiaohuan&rsquo;s face changed, and she wanted to deal with it. But before she went out, she had been pulled back by the immortal on Monday. She whispered: &ldquo;nonsense, this person is very important. It&rsquo;s not something that a child like you can handle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Small ring micro surprised, surprised to see Monday fairy, seems to have never seen grandfather so nervous and cautious.</p>
<p>At this time, only listen to that close to the black shadow pause, hoarse voice cold way: &ldquo;you just used the magic, but&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the middle of the mysterious man&rsquo;s words, Monday immortal suddenly despaired of everything and suddenly waved his arms. What suddenly appeared on his palm was as many as eight pieces of yellow runes.</p>
<p>When the night wind blows, eight pieces of Rune paper spontaneously ignite at the same time, and a little flame, such as dancing wildly on the palm of a fairy on Monday, makes his eyes shine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on! All the ghosts of Wuding will come back quickly; if the shadow is hidden, I will call you! &quot;</p>
<p>In the weeping of the immortals on Monday, there was a strong wind in the villa, and the sand and stones came in from all directions. The mysterious man&rsquo;s body was stunned. He seemed to be surprised. He looked around carefully. In the air, the five sounds of &ldquo;boom, boom and boom&rdquo; rang out in the air. The figures of the three men on Monday faintly shook, but they were still again.</p>
<p>The strong wind howled and rolled the yellow sand, which blew on the mysterious man one after another, blowing his clothes flying in the air. But in the gale, his face was black and motionless, but there was a sneer, and it came out again.</p>
<p>The man gave up the three immortals of Monday who were casting the magic. He suddenly stepped back and walked six steps. He drank softly, but his left hand was inserted into the ground. However, the blue halo was stabbed in an instant, and the hard ground exploded. Somehow, in the flickering of the blue light, the figure of the three immortals in the distance suddenly began to shake violently, and under the ground, a sound of pain was suddenly heard A cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh</p>
<p>In the villa, the wind and the sand gradually calmed down. Suddenly, when the three people standing on the ground exploded, they suddenly disappeared.</p>
<p>But in the big hole on the ground, with a few screams and pain, plopping, stumbling and falling out of the three figures, who are not the three immortals on Monday. The three faces were dusty, and Monday&rsquo;s noodles were blue and purple. Obviously, he suffered a dark loss. But it seemed that he had not had time to take care of these things. He only looked up at the mysterious man and was shocked.</p>
<p>The strange mysterious figure stood in the distance, looked at them, snorted, and said in a hoarse voice: &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe that you can even master the long lost magic arts such as&rdquo; Wuding Jinjia &ldquo;and&rdquo; imp carrying &ldquo;, and can perform these two magic arts with&rdquo; Di Dun &ldquo;at the same time. I almost underestimate you. I&rsquo;m afraid that no one in the world can surpass you in terms of these miracles. &quot;</p>
<p>Zhou Yixian looked solemn. Although he looked funny, he said in a deep voice: &ldquo;how can you see through it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man said faintly, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you say I&rsquo;m a member of Qingyun gate? These little skills in the river and lake were the housekeeping work of the founder of Qingyun gate. Even if I can&rsquo;t, can&rsquo;t I see it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Monday immortal slowly stood up, but his heart was flashing. He felt that he couldn&rsquo;t cope with this mysterious figure. His conduct was unpredictable. He was afraid to look around the world and find someone who could fight against him. What is more puzzling is that he seems to be under the Qingyun gate, and he is only seen in his life when he practices on the Xuanqing road of Taiji. However, he is so fierce that he has never been seen before. How could such a person appear in this abandoned villa in the middle of the night? (to be continued. )</p>
