      <p>In the cold stone room, only the great wizard&rsquo;s low breath. The ghost king and GUI Li stood in front of the weak old man, staring at his old face tightly. At the moment, the remaining life of the great wizard was their only hope.</p>
<p>The great wizard gasped a little, raised his head, and laughed at them both. The ghost king was a little relieved. After pondering for a moment, the great wizard said to the ghost king, &ldquo;please find some blood, and blood is the best way to attract ghosts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ghost Li micro a frown, ghost king already nodded: &ldquo;this easy to do.&rdquo; Just as he was about to leave, he suddenly remembered something. He stopped and asked the great wizard, &ldquo;master, this blood Is it animal blood or human blood? &quot;</p>
<p>The great wizard was stunned and took a look at the ghost king, but still said: &ldquo;animal blood can be used, but if the effect wheel is used, human blood is the best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost King nodded, walked to the door, opened the stone gate, and saw Qinglong and Youji standing outside the door, and the ghost man in black was standing a little farther away. Seeing the ghost King come out suddenly, Qinglong and Youji have a slightly surprised look on their faces at the same time, but the ghost king doesn&rsquo;t look at them much and says to Mr. ghost directly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take a basin of fresh human blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Qinglong Youji is stunned, but Mr. ghost just nods and turns away. The ghost king also turns back, but Qinglong and Youji are standing in the same place.</p>
<p>In the cold stone room, the atmosphere suddenly became a little strange. He looked at the Biyao lying there silently. After a long time, he turned around and looked at the great wizard who closed his eyes, and then his eyes fell on the ghost king.</p>
<p>However, the ghost King seemed to feel nothing at all. He looked at Biyao with a pair of eyes, and occasionally looked at the GUI Li side. He just turned around and did not stop at all.</p>
<p>On the stone door, there was a sudden sound of two sounds. Then he opened it slowly. Mr. ghost came in with a copper basin and put it in front of the wizard. Then he nodded to the ghost king.</p>
<p>Ghost King tiny jaw head, ghost Mr. also did not say what, quietly retreated out.</p>
<p>Deep red blood, gently waving in the copper basin. A strong smell of blood filled the stone chamber.</p>
<p>With a slight twitch in the corner of his eyes, the ghost king looked at the king of ghosts, but he slowly said to the great wizard, &ldquo;master, the blood you want. Here it is. &quot;</p>
<p>The great wizard opened his eyes and looked at the basin of blood in front of him. He was silent. He sighed for a while and said, &ldquo;OK, let&rsquo;s start.&rdquo;</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Supporting the weak body, the wizard slowly stood up, but did not wait for him to stand up straight, the body has begun to shake. He grabbed a step and helped him from the side.</p>
<p>The great wizard looked at him. A bitter smile, but no longer delay.</p>
<p>The frail old man slowly reached into his arms and felt for a moment. When he reached out his hand, he already had a strange red pen in his hand. The body of the pen was about the size of a thumb, about the length of an ordinary person&rsquo;s palm. The end is a dog&rsquo;s head shape. The red pen is made of some strange charms. At the front end of the pen, there is a uniform tuft of fine hair. We can&rsquo;t see the original color, only the residual dark red attached to it. I don&rsquo;t know, what this pen used to be contaminated with is mostly blood and so on.</p>
<p>Hold the pen. Breathe deeply!</p>
<p>With the help of the devil, the great wizard lowered his body, soaked the red pen in the blood for a moment and lifted it up.</p>
<p>Blood from the tip of the pen between the fine hair, a drop of silent slide, fell in the copper basin. In the face of blood ripples, rippling open.</p>
<p>With the pen in hand, the great wizard slowly walked to the cold stone platform where Biyao was lying under the support of the ghost. He drew the first stroke slowly from the place where the stone platform bordered the ground.</p>
<p>The bright colors gradually extended on the original flat ground, and the old man&rsquo;s trembling hand drew a series of blood symbols. There was no sound around, but somehow the atmosphere seemed to be getting tense.</p>
<p>The ghost King watched for a while, quietly went to the copper basin, picked up the copper basin, walked a few steps, and put it beside the great wizard. The great wizard who was drawing the symbol raised his head to look at him, nodded silently, and then lowered his head to continue.</p>
<p>More and more blood strokes, centered on the icy stone platform of Biyao, gradually appear around her. A strange and bloody array has already appeared.</p>
<p>The big wizard&rsquo;s red pen is obviously also a foreign body in the witchcraft of Southern Xinjiang. The blood sucked by the red pen was painted on the ground by the great wizard. The blood was coagulated but not dried, and the color was fresh and moist. At the corner turning point, there was no trace of blood splashing out. It was as if the painting was a solid place, and the blood was firmly circled in it.</p>
<p>With the panting sound of the great wizard again sounded, and gradually intensified, the blood patterns on the ground also gradually multiplied. These strange patterns, some looked like livestock and beasts, some like birds and birds, and some did not look like any strange patterns, one after another, and no one was the same.</p>
<p>There is only one thing in common, that is, these patterns are all connected with each other. More and more blood is drawn on the ground from the copper basin. However, the color of the blood falling on the ground seems to be more bright than the blood in the copper basin.</p>
<p>The smell of blood in the air became more and more intense. In the stone chamber, besides the panting voice of the great wizard, there was no abnormal sound.</p>
<p>The array of patterns drawn with blood started from the ground at the stone platform on the left shoulder of Biyao, and the great wizard applied them one by one. GUI Li helped him by his side and watched with his own eyes that the fresh blood color gradually converged into an oval ring with a radius of five feet. At the moment, in addition to a small piece of ground near the stone platform on the head of Biyao, the surrounding area of Biyao has become a bloody one.</p>
<p>Once again, the ghost King picked up the copper basin, put it on the ground above the stone platform, and then slowly walked to one side. This weird array is almost finished.</p>
<p>Countless strange patterns, large or small, twinkle with blood. At first glance, they look like a river crisscross with rivers, and the bright red and lively blood is swimming happily as if in the blood.</p>
<p>From one place to the other, from the end of the reverse and back, like a gentle tide, endless.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>The interwoven scarlet gradually converged on the ground under his feet. The wizard&rsquo;s hand did not know when to start, as if he could no longer hold the red pen.</p>
<p>Supporting the old man&rsquo;s body, it was so obvious that he felt the pain from that old body. Even he could not understand what the body was about. Still can hold on to now.</p>
<p>The heavy wheezing had become hoarse by now, and the wizard&rsquo;s forehead was wet, but there was no sweat to shed.</p>
<p>He held out his hand slowly and slowly. The red stroke dipped in blood made the last stroke, and the last completed pattern was connected with the blood map drawn by the first one before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poof!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a low voice, the red pen fell to one side powerlessly. The weight in the ghost sharp arm bend suddenly heavy, the big wizard&rsquo;s body is so soft down.</p>
<p>The ghost sharp heart a jump, the mind can not help but &ldquo;buzz&rdquo; ring, even the back are momentarily needle piercing fear feeling. He held his breath and held the great wizard in his hands. Looking down, he saw that the great wizard&rsquo;s face was very gray, but his mouth was slightly widened and he was panting. It was obviously caused by excessive exertion.</p>
<p>GUI Li put his heart back. At the same time, I was startled to find that the back of his forehead was wet just now.</p>
<p>One side, almost at the same time, came the ghost king long breath voice, obviously he was also a little frightened. At this moment, the two men, who were arrogant over the world, were shocked by the action of this dying old man.</p>
<p>The great wizard panted for a long time, and his spirit seemed to recover slightly. He nodded to Gui Li, indicating that he let himself sit down. Looking at the wizard&rsquo;s appearance, he was afraid that the old man would die if he was not careful. But at this moment, even if there is no way to worry about it, I have to follow the instructions of the great wizard and help him to sit down at the top of the Biyao stone platform.</p>
<p>The great wizard breathed deeply and looked forward in front of him. It is a blood array that has been completely connected together. The blood channels all over the ground imprison countless blood. The fresh blood, as if affected by the invisible force, began to flow in the same direction almost at the same time on the flat ground, without a trace of blood in the middle.</p>
<p>From this end to the other end, and then flow back from the connected channels, it becomes a cycle of itself, endless and endless.</p>
<p>Standing behind the great wizard, GUI Li and the ghost king looked at each other. Both of them were great experts in Xiuzhen Taoism, and both of them were shocked at the moment.</p>
<p>The great wizard pondered for a moment, stretched out his withered palm, picked up the red pen that had just fallen beside him, and stood upright in front of him, with the red hair on the tip of the pen downward. From the red pen, there were still some blood drops, which condensed into beads. After struggling on the fine hairs for a moment, they fell silently and melted into the bloody River in front of him.</p>
<p>The great wizard&rsquo;s eyes were fixed, and the heavy breathing voice suddenly calmed down. In the stone chamber, it was suddenly calm!</p>
<p>His eyebrows were raised slowly, and the light in his originally godless eyes was also slowly shining. The blood in the array in front of him seemed to have been stimulated by something, and the speed of running was suddenly accelerated.</p>
<p>With the red pen hand, slowly fell, and soon touched the ground, just three inches in front of the most peripheral blood river. The fine red hair touched the ground, but it didn&rsquo;t bend. Suddenly, the whole ground seemed to be turned into soft water. The red pen was inserted into the ground slowly and soundlessly.</p>
<p>The scene atmosphere in the stone chamber gradually became strange. With the faster and faster blood color River, it gradually gave out a faint whistling sound. The light blood gas went deep into the ground with the red pen, and gradually rose from the array. Later, the light white air from the cold stone platform was merged to surround the body of Biyao.</p>
<p>Ghost king and GUI Li&rsquo;s eyes did not blink, staring at the field.</p>
<p>The great wizard released his hand holding the red pen, and the deep chanting voice began to reverberate in the stone chamber. Between the cracked lips of the great wizard, the strange tones one after another were uttered slightly but frequently. His hands seemed to follow the inexplicable melody, slowly reaching into the air, five fingers into claws, and gently waving.</p>
<p>The roaring sound in the stone chamber is getting louder and louder. On the ground, the blood River in the array is already surging. Waves of ghost power are roaring from the blood river.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the big wizard spit out a sharp whistling sound, his hands and five fingers like claws clasped backward, &ldquo;poof&rdquo; a catch into the blood river.</p>
<p>Almost at the same time, the ghost king and GUI Li stood behind him in a daze. At that moment, they only felt that the stone chamber around them was no longer in existence. The four stone walls and the upper and lower stone slabs suddenly became empty, as if they were living in the boundless space of Xumi and the vast sky, and there was nothing to rely on.</p>
<p>I heard the sound of ghosts crying, and they came from all directions. The brilliant red light burst out from the red blood array and rose into the sky. Red light swaying, countless ghosts and ghosts of the shadow panic. If you are absorbed here by the invisible giant life, you can&rsquo;t help but run around, but you can&rsquo;t leave the red light curtain.</p>
<p>At this moment, the stone chamber was restored to its original appearance. GUI Li and GUI Wang&rsquo;s consciousness also immediately revived. The two people were shocked. They knew that at that moment, the &ldquo;soul summoning&rdquo; array actually regarded the surrounding Shibi mountain as nothing. With the mysterious and magical power of Southern Xinjiang, it forcibly penetrated the nine ghost world, captured countless ghosts and spirits, and imprisoned them in this array.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that the soul summoning array is so magical that it consumes a lot of energy. Looking through the red light, the great wizard&rsquo;s face has become so bad that it can&rsquo;t be worse. He is dead at the moment. I&rsquo;m afraid some people believe it.</p>
<p>The ghost king and his heart beat faster than they could. They prayed secretly that the great wizard would support him. At the same time, their eyes were fixed on the array.</p>
<p>In the field, countless ghosts and ghosts roared and danced in the red light. There were ordinary ghosts and strange looking mountain monsters. After a while, these ghosts which were bounced back by the red light probably knew that they could not get out of the trap, and turned their heads and roared at the great wizard sitting in the front of the array.</p>
<p>The great wizard did not look at these angry ghosts, and his eyes slowly raised. Looking at the red light shrouded between the stone platform, in the hands of the white jade Huan bell. He waved his arms abruptly, his left hand as claw, but the five fingers of his right hand changed. The ring finger and the little finger are three points inside. The middle finger and index finger are like a sword. The thumb is soaring into the sky. It is just the magic formula of the sorcery way, and the fingers are flying in the air.</p>
<p>The bell of Albizzia is ringing!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ding!&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The clear and crisp ring sound is like the deep valley warbler. In the morning, the bell of Albizzia leaves from the hands of Biyao and rises slowly into the air. Light golden light, from the bell body again.</p>
<p>Almost at the same time when the great wizard pointed to the Albizzia bell, countless ghosts and ghosts in the blood summoning array were urged by invisible forces. Although they were angry and unwilling, they all rushed to the golden Albizzia bell which rose into the air like the tide.</p>
<p>In an instant, the spirit of ghosts was very strong, and the body of joyous bells trembled violently. The forces of ghosts and Demons poured in from all directions and attacked repeatedly. Countless ghosts swarmed in, biting the bell body and pounding fiercely. The scene was crazy. Under this scene, the red sea of blood in the blood color array became more and more fresh, and the blood roared, almost boiling!</p>
<p>It seems that they can&rsquo;t stand this gloomy ghost force. The light golden light of Albizzia julibrissin gradually darkens and submerges in countless ghosts. After a moment, a sharp ring makes a light smoke rising from the top of the bell. It seems that the second half of the bell is still in the bell.</p>
<p>The face of the great wizard, somehow, suddenly turned a little ruddy. It was much better than just now. Even his arms seemed more powerful.</p>
<p>There was a glimmer of joy on his old face and a big drink in his mouth</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes!</p>
<p>The remnant soul comes out of the body,</p>
<p>Nine souls return.</p>
<p>The yellow spring is nine secluded,</p>
<p>The soul is the guide</p>
<p>What the wizard drank was full of energy and awe inspiring. With his words and drinks, the red light suddenly scattered and covered the whole stone room. The king of ghosts and ghosts only felt that there was a roar around. Just now, the feeling of emptiness, gloominess and being in the nine hell world reappeared. The difference is that at the moment, there are countless ghosts and ghosts flying around Dance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boom</p>
<p>It seems that he has never stayed for a moment. If the electric light can&rsquo;t be stopped through the sky, the two of them haven&rsquo;t come back to their senses. The surrounding scene turns back to the stone chamber again. In the red demon curtain, when countless ghosts are flying, the smoke on the joyous bell is surrounded by countless ghosts, and one after another of light smoke slowly appears.</p>
<p>1、 Two, three 8、 Nine!</p>
<p>Three souls and seven spirits, is for the soul!</p>
<p>GUI Li shivered all over his body, and his fingernails were deeply immersed in the flesh, and there was blood flowing down, but he didn&rsquo;t know it. In that red curtain of light, there are all kinds of light smoke</p>
<p>He turned his head and looked at the great wizard.</p>
<p>Just a moment!</p>
<p>Just a moment!</p>
<p>He can&rsquo;t help but roar in his heart!</p>
<p>The big wizard&rsquo;s face was flushed, and suddenly faded away like a tide. Deep wrinkles around the corner of the eye, began to twitch.</p>
<p>The withered hands waving in the air began to shake again. Only his voice, still so loud:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three souls and seven spirits,</p>
<p>Gather spirits for God.</p>
<p>To search the spirit with God,</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one thing! &quot;</p>
<p>With the sound of his words, the nine pieces of smoke that appeared in the air successively flew out of the ghosts and spirits, and slowly approached the Albizzia bell, and gradually merged with the light smoke on the Albizzia bell.</p>
<p>Faintly, the human figure gradually appeared.</p>
<p>At this moment, not only the ghost, even the ghost king can&rsquo;t help shaking, the face has excited color.</p>
<p>The great wizard didn&rsquo;t know when he started. His hands were shaking even more. In the red light, he opened his mouth and said in a loud voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The soul has become,</p>
<p>The spirits return to their places.</p>
<p>The spirit and the spirit enter&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>The word &ldquo;body&rdquo; remained in his throat. At the moment when he was about to leave, the voice of the great wizard suddenly became so dumb. What he sent out was only a slight and deep &ldquo;hoarse&rdquo; voice.</p>
<p>GUI Wang and GUI Li changed their faces at the same time.</p>
<p>The red light shakes violently in the soul summoning array, and suddenly a loud noise is heard. The red light is scattered, and countless ghosts suddenly rise to the sky and plunge into the ground of the stone wall and disappear in a blink of an eye. But the ghost king and GUI Li didn&rsquo;t take care of that much. Through the complicated images, they looked directly at the great wizard.</p>
<p>The old man held his hands up in the air, but his head dropped slowly.</p>
<p>GUI Li and the ghost King rushed to the wizard&rsquo;s side like electricity and held his body. However, the head of the wizard was still so slow but irresistible. Just in his mouth, but as if still struggling to say something.</p>
<p>The ghost king and GUI Li tried to get close to the great wizard. In the vague voice, they could only vaguely hear a few intermittent words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well Jiuyou Hmmm To Yin Well Not This&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>The voice gradually became low and silent, and the old man&rsquo;s head finally hung on his chest, and there was no news again.</p>
<p>Through the bones of the cold, such as exposure to the deep underworld ice prison, two wooden men, can&rsquo;t believe all this.</p>
<p>The dissipated red awn gradually disappeared, the turbulent blood river was quiet, and the blood stains without power could no longer imprison the blood, and the fresh human blood flowed all over the place.</p>
<p>The light smoke on the bell of Albizzia julibrissin was taken back and disappeared in the bell. The light golden light comes up again, setting off the Albizzia bell.</p>
<p>A gentle shake, accompanied by the clear bell, the bell of Albizzia falls slowly, and returns to lie on the cold stone platform, in the hands of Biyao, quiet as before.</p>
<p>Death like silence, filled in the cold stone room, for a long time, there is no sound at all (to be continued. )</p>
