      <p>&ldquo;Zheng&rdquo;!</p>
<p>It was a crackle in the dark!</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s face was as cold as frost, and she stood in front of Zhang Xiaofan and pulled out her sword.</p>
<p>Out of the sheath!</p>
<p>Blue light, pure and brilliant light, reflects the dark world.</p>
<p>In an instant, all the dark lights of the spirits lost their luster in front of the blue light. However, the spirits seemed to be fearless and rushed from all directions.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi rebuked, pale face passed a little pain, but was immediately replaced by a stronger look.</p>
<p>Under the master&rsquo;s urging, the sky Ya divine sword is in full bloom with blue light. It is shining brightly. It faces the spirits rushing forward and sweeps past.</p>
<p>Only in the moment of blue light contacting with those ghosts, the sound of &ldquo;Zizi&rdquo; was immediately sounded, which was almost fried and burst. Dozens of ghosts disappeared at that time, and their spirits were gone.</p>
<p>The sound reverberated in the open and dark place, which was creepy.</p>
<p>However, although the power of Tianya divine sword is great, it can&rsquo;t intimidate the rest of the spirits. Only when Lu Xueqi moves, several spirits swoop on Zhang Xiaofan who faints on the ground from behind.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s eyes were full of light. When he returned to the body, Tianya divine sword only swept through Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s body, which dispelled the spirits.</p>
<p>But there are too many ghosts around here to kill. Lu Xueqi is injured again. In a few rounds, he is sweating and breathing heavily. But I felt that all the faces were flying around, crying and pawing, and the blue light of Tianya was getting weaker. Lu Xueqi clenched her teeth, but she was still soft at the foot and fell down beside Zhang Xiaofan.</p>
<p>In the roar of the sky and the spirit, there was a cry of complacency. The light was white and the air was cloudy. Lu Xueqi turns her head and looks at Zhang Xiaofan.</p>
<p>Although the boy was in a coma at the moment, his face was painful, but did he think of anything sad?</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi said in a low voice, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect to die with you today!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sat up straight, and now her face was bloodless, but she still refused to give up. The fingers of her right hand are bent and stretched to make the formula of orchid method. With her gesture, Tianya divine sword pauses slightly in the mid air. Huo Ran fell back and &ldquo;clanked&rdquo; into the ground in front of Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s body. Then the blue light rose again. On the ground, there was a circle of light centered on the Tianya divine sword, which surrounded Lu Xueqi and Zhang Xiaofan.</p>
<p>Around the eyes of the ghosts, the delicious flesh and blood body is in front of them.</p>
<p>No matter how much, they rushed up quickly. But a moment later, the circle of light on the ground suddenly rose up, and suddenly saw the blue light rising and the auspicious steam rising. If the blue light had spirit, it flashed in a circular arc from the top of the two people&rsquo;s heads, blocking the spirit outside.</p>
<p>But if the eye sees it, it can see that the light of the aperture is too weak. Ruiqi is also powerless, but Lu Xueqi is dying.</p>
<p>Seeing that the delicious food is blocked again, the sky is full of anger and the sound of crying is getting louder and louder. Countless spirits strive to hit the fragile aperture. Every time they hit, Lu Xueqi trembled, his face was even paler, and the brilliance of Tianya divine sword was dimmed. The original two people&rsquo;s high aperture. In a short time, it was pressed to the size of less than one person.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s face is as white as paper. He looks at the ghostly faces outside the aperture, showing a ferocious and horrible smile, and sees that they open their empty mouths. Her whole body seemed to be in the ice.</p>
<p>At this time, she suddenly heard that Zhang Xiaofan, who was unconscious beside her, suddenly said something vaguely.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi turned her head. There was no words to describe her mood at the moment. She had been fighting with these spirits alone for a long time. Suddenly heard the voice of his companion, there was a joy that had never been felt before.</p>
<p>But before she could see the appearance of Zhang Xiaofan clearly, she suddenly fell down. The ground where she and Zhang Xiaofan were sitting was originally a hard ground. At this moment, they suddenly split a big hole in Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s place silently, and Zhang Xiaofan suddenly fell down.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi stayed for a while, only to see that the cave was dark, but could not see how deep it was. Only in that deep place, there were a pair of huge and horrible blood red eyes, twinkling and twinkling!</p>
<p>At the next moment, without any hesitation, the aura of the Heavenly Sword dissipated. In the roar of the sky, Lu Xueqi reached out and pulled up Tianya, let alone fell into the deep black hole!</p>
<p>A moment later, all the spirits in the mid air followed in, screaming and ringing through the hole.</p>
<p>There was a dull crash in the cave. A moment later, there was a sharp roar in the roar of the ghost drum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ouch&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cry was painful. It was like the wild boar&rsquo;s roar when he was injured. A moment later, a huge figure jumped out of the cave first, followed by countless ghosts flying all over the sky.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi, in the light, helped Zhang Xiaofan out of the ground with his left hand, and a red blood flowed from the corner of his mouth. His left body was red, and it seemed that he was hurt.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan can only stand by Lu Xueqi at the moment, but his eyes are open, and the fire stick is lit up again. Although it is weak, it still emits a dark blue light.</p>
<p>This young man and woman, in this dark world, support each other and depend on each other.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi looks at the spirits flying all over the sky, but she still dare not rush down. Suddenly, she is speechless with joy. Although she is still in danger, someone is standing by her side. It&rsquo;s very good.</p>
<p>Then, their eyes fell on the huge shadow in front of them, against the white light emitted by the spirit of the underworld. They saw the appearance of the beast after smelling a strong smell of putrefaction.</p>
<p>This is a huge monster with only two people tall. It has a pig head and a dog body. Its tusks are long and sharp, its body is red and black, and its brown hair stands upright like a steel needle. A pair of giant eyes are bloody red in the dark, which is somewhat like the red eye of the eldest one in the year of demon demon man.</p>
<p>At the moment, the beast was lying in the distance, breathing heavily. Under its black and dirty fur, the flesh and blood of its left front paw turned over. It seemed that it was hurt by Lu Xueqi. And it also stares at these two people who hurt it, and shoots out fierce hatred in their eyes. They want to swallow it and then quickly!</p>
<p>The spirits were flying in the sky, and they also flew by the beast, but they didn&rsquo;t attack it. Obviously, they never offended each other.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi just felt the pain and fatigue all over her body, and almost wanted to fall asleep like this. She didn&rsquo;t need to think about anything more. However, after several struggles, she still insisted on it and said to Zhang Xiaofan in a low voice: &ldquo;there are too many monsters and spirits here. I don&rsquo;t know what else will come out later. Let&rsquo;s go first. &quot;</p>
<p>Where can Zhang Xiaofan have an opinion, nod to agree. They backed away, but they took a step. The spirit in the sky keeps up, and the monster seems to be unwilling to give up, but it also keeps up. In this way, the spirit of hell is afraid of Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s fire stick, and the pig head monster seems to be afraid of him and them. But he would not give up.</p>
<p>Zhang and Lu had been injured. They were exhausted after a series of fierce fights in the dark and damp lifeless abyss. At this moment, if the spirits were not forced by the beast, they would faint once they relaxed.</p>
<p>But at the moment, he and his wife are facing a life and death crisis. Their courage and strength come from nowhere, and they are struggling to the present.</p>
<p>The abyss of the dead, which is never known to the righteous, is a tremendous abyss. After retreating here for a long time, he and his wife walked only on the open space, without any sign of a precipice. How could they have fallen so far when they fell down?</p>
<p>But he and his two people have no time to think about it now. There are monsters and spirits in front of them. Life and death are really only in a moment. Zhang Lu and his wife are at a loss. Zhang Xiaofan suddenly feels a pain in the back and bumps into a hard object.</p>
<p>For a long time, both of them dare not take the beast lightly, so they just walk backward. All of a sudden, Zhang Xiaofan was shocked and turned around. Unexpectedly, he saw a big tree. The trunk is thick. It seems that no three people can hold it together.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan then put his heart down and said to Lu Xueqi, who was staring at the back: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s OK. It&rsquo;s just a tree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before he finished speaking, Zhang Xiaofan suddenly felt a sore throat and his neck was entangled with a rope like thing. The whole man was twisted by a great force.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi was shocked. Looking back, she lost her voice and said, &ldquo;tree demon!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I saw this big tree growing alone in this open space. At the moment, all the static branches moved like human arms, and Zhang Xiaofan was caught by one of the thick branches. In the dark, the tree demon&rsquo;s dancing posture is like a nine hell devil.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan only felt that the tree on his neck was getting tighter and tighter, and he could not breathe. Lu Xueqi just wanted to rescue, but only heard a startling roar in the distance. The pig headed monster seized the opportunity, jumped up, and its huge claws flashed a faint green light. He beat them at once, afraid they were still carrying a huge poison.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi had no choice but to return to parry, but her body shape was blocked by it. She wanted to rescue Zhang Xiaofan several times but could not get it. Instead, she was in danger.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was caught by the tree demon, and his throat hurt a lot, but he saw that the tree demon made an unpleasant noise. Most of the time, he thought it was joy. The tree around his neck pulled him back to the tree body. At the same time, several branches came to him and wrapped his body. Except for two hands, he could not struggle any more.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s heart was burning. Looking at Lu Xueqi, she found that she couldn&rsquo;t care about herself. Looking back, she saw the spirits of the dead. She saw that a big opening was slowly opened on the trunk of the tree demon, and there was a pungent smell coming out of it. The tree strip was pulling him to that big opening, for fear that it would be the big opening of the tree demon.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan shivered all over. He never thought that he would make fertilizer for a tree one day. This kind of death is really unacceptable.</p>
<p>But now that he was on the verge of attack, he did move to the big mouth one by one. The smell was more and more strong. In a twinkling of an eye, Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s forehead was cold and sweaty.</p>
<p>At the sight of the big mouth, Zhang Xiaofan did not know where his strength came from. As soon as he worked hard, he would not move forward with his feet on the tree trunk. Unfortunately, the power of the tree demon was so great that he pulled the tree several times. Zhang Xiaofan was exhausted and was sent to the big mouth.</p>
<p>The strong fishy smell came to his face, and he didn&rsquo;t know how many lives the tree demon had killed. Zhang Xiaofan was dying and struggling at the moment of life and death. He raised his hand vigorously, held the only weapon in his hand, the fire stick, and inserted it beside the tree demon&rsquo;s big mouth.</p>
<p>On the fire stick, especially on the ball at the front, there was a faint blue light.</p>
<p>The originally thick and blunt fire staff was wielded by Zhang Xiaofan and hit the tree demon. It was like a magic weapon, cutting melons and vegetables, and directly inserted into the tree trunk of the tree demon. All over the sky dancing tree demon branches in that moment, all of a sudden solidified.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan himself was also stunned for a while. At the same time, he felt a sudden fear.</p>
<p>A familiar, cold feeling swam across the body, and then it brought a brand-new breath. The warm stream flowed from the fire stick into Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s body. As before, Zhang Xiaofan fought against the vampire Jiang Laosan in wanbat grottoes.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan is in the air. Stay!</p>
<p>He stared at what was happening before him. The arrogant and fierce tree demon was only inserted into his body by a fire stick that seemed ugly. The huge body out of proportion to the fire stick withered rapidly. All the branches, tree branches and even tree trunks were like all the water being drained away. They were shriveled and shrunk. The leaves fell like the rain, after the last roar of life. The whole tree collapsed, and then turned into luou.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan fell to the ground and was stunned. He didn&rsquo;t even need luck to know that the warm current sucked by the fire stick was very beneficial to his body. The original injured meridians were nourished by the new warm current, and Da luoun turned.</p>
<p>He looked at the fire stick in his hand, and saw that it was turning slightly in the dark blue light, as if it were a full man. The fire staff radiates contented radiance, especially on the staff body. The originally inconspicuous bloodshot is now as bright and red as the blood. It is ferocious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dang&rdquo;, which seemed to be a bit horrible, slipped from Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s hand, fell to the ground and jumped twice. Stay still.</p>
<p>Without Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s hand, the magic black stick seems to have lost the host of parasitism. All the light disappears immediately and becomes an ordinary black stick.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan is breathing deeply. The mind is in turmoil, and there is only one voice in the mind: what is this, what is this?</p>
<p>At this time, suddenly a distant land snow Qi pain call, Zhang Xiaofan suddenly woke up, turned to see. Lu Xueqi was besieged by numerous ghosts and the pig headed monster. The whole person seemed to be hit hard and flew out. His clothes were red and he was hurt badly.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was so excited that he took charge of the mess. He grabbed the fire stick in his hand and flew to Lu Xueqi.</p>
<p>In the middle of the sky, the fire stick was in his hand, as if with a smile, it lit up a dark blue light again, illuminating his face.</p>
<p>In the place where Zhang Xiaofan passed, countless spirits dodged and fled. In an instant, Zhang Xiaofan caught up with Lu Xueqi, but the pig headed monster in front was not afraid of the fire stick and roared at him.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan is worried about Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s injury and refuses to retreat. With the same roar, he uses the Taoist method taught by Su Ru, his teacher&rsquo;s mother, before going down the mountain. The fire stick leaves his hand like an arrow leaving the string and rushes towards the pig head beast.</p>
<p>Seeing this little black stick coming, the pig head monster waved its huge front paw and tried to move the disgusting thing aside, and then rushed up to devour these two disgusting but delicious human beings.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, as soon as he waved his hand, he felt that the palm of his hand was cold. After a while, his heart was cold again. The pig head monster was stunned. Looking down, he saw a small hole in his hand, and a small hole in the heart of his chest. His whole body was pierced by this seemingly inconspicuous fire stick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ow&rdquo;!</p>
<p>With a loud roar, the pig head monster shakes its huge body like a mountain and a pillar, falling heavily to the ground and flying dust. Then, it struggled on the ground for several times, and black blood flowed from the corners of its mouth, and finally it stopped moving.</p>
<p>At this time Zhang Xiaofan catches Lu Xueqi, but sees her whole body is cold, already is the support does not live, fainted in the past. And the fire stick that killed a living creature flickered with the light of black and blue. It flew back and fell into Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s hands.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan felt that the injury in her body was better than that in her body. After checking Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s breathing, he found that she was in a hurry. When he looked down, he saw that the skin on her left shoulder wound had turned black, which was obviously poisoned.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was very anxious, but he was afraid that although two monsters were dead, there were countless ghosts around him, so he had to turn around and look at them. Unexpectedly, when he looked at them, he saw that the spirits had gone away and disappeared into the darkness. Zhang Xiaofan is greatly shocked, but this is a good thing that he can&rsquo;t get. Where can he think so much? He quickly turns back to take care of Lu Xueqi.</p>
<p>In fact, Zhang Xiaofan didn&rsquo;t know that all this was due to the &ldquo;blood bead&rdquo; on his staff. Eight hundred years ago, the &ldquo;blood refining hall&rdquo; of the great light demon sect of the black heart old man was famous all over the world. In the labyrinth under the ground of the ten thousand bat ancient cave, the basic business of the blood refining hall was founded.</p>
<p>The old man of black heart is a ferocious man. In those years, countless lives were killed in refining this blood eating bead. How many of the dead spirits gathered in the lifeless pit of level UB, where they could not live.</p>
<p>At that time, they were all harmed by this blood eating bead. Although today, the blood eating bead and the nameless and fierce stick are combined into one. Their shape has changed greatly, and their evil spirit is fierce and restrained.</p>
<p>However, once Zhang Xiaofan cast his magic, the evil spirit of eating blood beads came out. One by one, these spirits were scared to be afraid. They thought that the old man with black heart was reborn again.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan slowly lowered Lu Xueqi to the ground, hesitated for a moment, looked at the black wound and sighed.</p>
<p>As if eternal darkness had restored the stillness of death.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan felt a little dizzy, but seeing Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s face wrapped up with wound, there was no black air, so he was relieved.</p>
<p>He sat quietly beside the comatose woman.</p>
<p>The fire staff sends out a faint blue light, covering them.</p>
<p>Silence!</p>
<p>Quiet!</p>
<p>There is no sound of insects. It seems that there is no living thing in the abyss except for the spirits and monsters.</p>
<p>However, just at this time, Zhang Xiaofan suddenly heard that there was a sound of footsteps, suddenly sounded.</p>
<p>This step in the dark, gentle and harmonious, but in Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s ear, but like a bolt from the blue. He stood up in a hurry, turned his head to look at the sound of his footsteps, and at the same time clenched the fire stick.</p>
<p>In the distance, there is a little light in the dark. Then, a woman appears in the light. She is dressed in water green clothes, with fine eyebrows and beautiful eyes. Her jade like skin is better than frost and snow. In the dark, she seems to have a kind of weird beauty, which is moving and weird.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan suddenly opened his mouth wide and was speechless. This woman was the green girl he met in the mountain and sea garden of Heyang city when he went down the mountain.</p>
<p>Note 1: the naked pig demon: pig head and dog body, huge body, black hair, hard thorn, red eyes, can see things in secret. They like to eat rotten things and live in the dark and wet places.</p>
<p>Note 2: &ldquo;spirits, spirits, spirits, spirits and monsters&rdquo; tree demon: a thousand year old tree is said to absorb the spirit of heaven and earth, and it is also said to absorb the power of evil spirits and monsters in the Yin and filth, so it becomes refined. Big tree like, predatory. There are also rumors that they can move themselves. (to be continued. )</p>
