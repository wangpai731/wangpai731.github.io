      <p>Shangguance only felt numb around the wound on his back. At the same time, the cold Yin and cold Qi constantly rushed from the Yin charm to the Qi pulse in his body. If he was bitten by ten thousand ants, he was extremely painful.</p>
<p>But for a moment, his forehead was sweating and his face turned pale. Xiaobai, standing on the roof, looked at shangguance&rsquo;s embarrassment in his eyes, and his smile became stronger, which meant gloating. He said with a smile: &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect that, old devil, you have today?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shangguan CE clenched his teeth and snorted coldly. He strongly supported himself and said in a sharp voice: &ldquo;demon, you dare to show up to see me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaobai laughed and seemed to hear the most ridiculous words. With a wave of his sleeve robe, the whole man floated down from the roof of the house and landed not far from Shangguan CE&rsquo;s body. He said with a smile, &ldquo;I dare not come out to see you? Yeah, I&rsquo;m so timid that I dare not see you. So I gave you a gift to meet you. That&rsquo;s why I dare to meet you. Old ghost, you have made me live in seclusion in the dark fire altar for many years. This time, I&rsquo;m sorry that I don&rsquo;t thank you well. &quot;</p>
<p>Shangguan CE was full of anger, but he was really scared. At that time, in xuanhuotan, most of them relied on the magic power of its own ground fire and the remnants of the eight fierce XuanHuo array at that time, which suppressed the thousand year old demon fox. Otherwise, he would have been able to deal with it if he did not have the Daoism of Jiuwei Tianhu.</p>
<p>But now time has changed and things have changed. Jiuwei Tianhu has already broken away from all the shackles. However, she was careless for a moment, and she was plotting with this evil spirit. She was greatly hurt. I&rsquo;m afraid she is not her opponent any more.</p>
<p>At this moment, the night wind on the wilderness is bleak, and the sound of ghosts crying and howling is everywhere. It seems that in this bleak night, countless night ghosts are crying at the same time, and the Yin Qi is very strong.</p>
<p>Within the Yizhuang, Xiaobai and shangguance still confront each other.</p>
<p>Although shangguance has been seriously injured by conspiracy, it seems that Xiaobai doesn&rsquo;t plan to deal with this old enemy immediately. On the contrary, she just looks at shangguance with interest. Like a cat catching a mouse, his face is satirical.</p>
<p>Shangguance knew that what he needed most at the moment was to find a safe and quiet place to use his skills to heal his wounds. But standing in front of him is such an enigmatic demon fox of thousand years, which is really irritating.</p>
<p>Angry, Shangguan CE hate voice: &ldquo;since you are determined to deal with me, why don&rsquo;t you start.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the point of standing still? &quot;</p>
<p>Xiaobai smiles and says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ok. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if I say it to you. I&rsquo;m not like you people. I always think that life is short. But I have a lot of time. I don&rsquo;t know how to spend it. So I stand here and watch you slowly. I&rsquo;m very patient anyway</p>
<p>Shangguance was so angry that he almost got angry. The evil spirit clearly wanted to hold him back. Knowing that he was badly hurt, shangguance would not have the opportunity to heal. After such a long time, shangguance was naturally exhausted. He didn&rsquo;t need Jiuwei Tianhu to do it. He was afraid that he could not hold on to it.</p>
<p>However, he Shangguan CE knows it, but he has some shameful methods for Xiaobai. But it is really helpless. If you fight, you have to bear a heavy blow. If you don&rsquo;t fight, you can&rsquo;t win. The injury is getting more and more serious, and it is a dead end to drag it down. It seems that other methods are useless, only to run away.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that Xiaobai&rsquo;s watery eyes, which seem to enchant the soul and soul, are so fresh and refreshing that he looks at Shangguan&rsquo;s policy. Even he doesn&rsquo;t know how to escape from Xiaobai&rsquo;s hands.</p>
<p>This is a real hit on all sides. In a desperate situation.</p>
<p>Shangguance&rsquo;s face was as dead as ashes, with resentment, anger, fear and anxiety on his face. All kinds of expressions passed by one by one. Xiaobai was greatly happy when he saw it in his eyes.</p>
<p>She was imprisoned in the xuanhuotan by a group of people in the burning incense Valley for many years. If it wasn&rsquo;t for the ghost who accidentally untied the seal, she really didn&rsquo;t know if she would stay in that ghost place all her life. The pain of the head here is really hard to tell people. In Xiaobai&rsquo;s heart, she was extremely annoyed with shangguance of the burning incense valley. Although she had a thorough understanding after escaping with GUI Li on that day, she did not deliberately go back to find the trouble of burning incense valley. But if shangguance was sent to her eyes automatically, how could she have thought that she had not seen it?</p>
<p>To be compassionate and to be kind to others is what Jiuwei Tianhu does when she is in a good mood. However, she is never a kind-hearted Bodhisattva who never forgets others and treats others kindly.</p>
<p>Thinking of his pride, Xiaobai couldn&rsquo;t help laughing. His resentment over the years seems to have come out tonight. He is really happy.</p>
<p>Shangguance&rsquo;s mood is naturally not as good as Xiaobai. On the contrary, it seems that his injury is hard to suppress. His whole body begins to tremble slightly. The ghost power of the Yin spirit rises, and the light blue light covers his back.</p>
<p>Xiao Bai&rsquo;s smile is stronger, and Shangguan CE&rsquo;s breathing voice becomes more and more urgent. Suddenly, he moves closer to Xiaobai. Xiaobai frowns slightly and looks alert. Although shangguance is in distress and injured, his practice is not trivial. Xiaobai doesn&rsquo;t dare to be careless.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just fantastic. It happens in a flash.</p>
<p>I saw shangguance&rsquo;s face was full of pain, and the veins on his face exploded. It seemed that he was going to be unable to hold on. His eyes turned white, and a little fear flashed on his face. Suddenly, he knelt down to Xiaobai and begged: &ldquo;Fox fairy, please spare my life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>If shangguance&rsquo;s moves are earth shaking miracles, Xiaobai is most likely to concentrate on the move. Even if shangguance suddenly drinks, and there are three or fifty incense Valley experts nearby, Xiaobai can accept this reality.</p>
<p>However, the old man who suddenly knelt down in front of her and begged for mercy completely overturned what she had known in the past. For a moment, even though she had been doing her thousand years of life, she was still at a loss.</p>
<p>However, after staying for a short time, Xiaobai has come to realize that Shangguan&rsquo;s policy is just for the sake of the gap.</p>
<p>In a flash, Shangguan, who was still dying just now, felt like a different person. His whole face was full of murderous intent, and his painful expression disappeared. Even the blue halo on his back was suppressed in an instant. The silver light of jiuhanning ice stab suddenly appears, like a startled dragon sweeping into the air. It flies backward from the bottom of his hand with a &ldquo;bang&rdquo; sound, and hits Xiaobai&rsquo;s chest.</p>
<p>Xiao Bai snapped angrily, and his body quickly and incomparably drifted back. At the same time, his sleeve robe flew up and blocked in front of him, forming a cloth wall. However, shangguance&rsquo;s attack was the place of his lifelong practice. His power was not small. He only heard the &ldquo;hissing&rdquo; sound burst. At that time, the sleeve robe was torn into pieces by the distance contained in the nine freezing ice thorns. Almost at the same time, it turned into ice, broke and fell to the ground.</p>
<p>And the silver light. He didn&rsquo;t stop at all and attacked Xiaobai. Xiaobai was still retreating, but the hasty retreat was not as quick as shangguance&rsquo;s deliberate and fatal blow. Seeing that the lethal light was about to catch up with her body, Xiaobai was pale, but there was no panic. She suddenly clasped her hands in front of her chest and crossed and stretched, but she made a strange gesture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew&rdquo;</p>
<p>A long and mysterious howl suddenly reverberates from unknown places. The howl is desolate and aloof, quiet and self-confident, bringing people into the mysterious artistic conception. On the full moon night, in the wilderness, a white fox calls to the moon</p>
<p>At the next moment, the light of jiuhanning ice thorn skyrocketed, and a silver light flashed, covering Xiaobai&rsquo;s whole body.</p>
<p>Shangguan CE Jedi was successful in counterattack, but he didn&rsquo;t look pleased. On the contrary, he was reluctant to bite his teeth. It&rsquo;s just that he is very human after all, after weighing the opportunity. Without any delay or hesitation, he immediately flew out, only a few ups and downs. His gray figure had disappeared in the vast wilderness outside the villa.</p>
<p>The silver halo faded slowly. There is light blood on the ground, but Xiaobai is gone.</p>
<p>In the middle of the sky, the mysterious sound of fox howling was still continuous and long, and it fell quietly for a long time, corresponding to it, like it appeared out of thin air. Xiaobai&rsquo;s graceful body appeared again in the air and fell down slowly.</p>
<p>She looked down at the bloodstain on the ground, her teeth biting her lips, and her face was full of anger. Just now, she was careless, but she didn&rsquo;t expect that shangguance had come up with such a method in order to survive. On the contrary, she was schemed by him and almost killed.</p>
<p>Fortunately, she is not very human. She is a Nine Tailed Tianhu.</p>
<p>Foxes have nine tails!</p>
<p>Not to be reckoned with!</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>The night wind is cold, blowing from a distance, blowing on the surface, it is really a little cold.</p>
<p>Xiaobai stood in the courtyard, calmed down, then slowly turned around and looked at the dark hut.</p>
<p>She walked in slowly.</p>
<p>There was still a quiet darkness in the house of the villa. It seemed that the exciting and fierce fighting had never happened before.</p>
<p>At the moment, her figure gradually appeared dim at the door. But obviously, Xiaobai is not afraid of this kind of atmosphere as ordinary people. She is the ancestor of these demons and demons. If you want to pretend to be a ghost, not to mention a human being, it is true that there is a real ghost coming, and it may not be better than her. Who is scared away is still unknown.</p>
<p>At this moment, the small and clear eyes in the dark room in a circle, in the middle of a more detailed look at several coffins in the room, in her eyes, flash a few silk of confused eyes. At the end of the day, however, her attention was focused on the coffin in the quiet corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come out, I know you&rsquo;re in it.&rdquo; Xiaobai didn&rsquo;t walk past, just stood there, so light tunnel.</p>
<p>No one answered, only silence.</p>
<p>The Lich hiding in the coffin, unable to move, did not know what kind of mood he felt at the moment. He thought that he could hide the strategy from the sky and hide in the coffin. Unexpectedly, shangguance and Xiaobai found out successively. Even in the coffin, there was a living person who came in earlier than him, but he did not find it.</p>
<p>I think it must be a failure</p>
<p>Xiaobai frowned a little, and took a step forward, but then stopped again. At the same time, she looked at the dark place around her. The color of her eyes became more confused. It seems that there is something in the dark here that makes her afraid and hesitant.</p>
<p>She was silent for a moment, and then she said, &ldquo;I know your identity. You must have seen me that day in the ancient cave of demons. In this case, we see no resentment. I just have one thing to ask you. &quot;</p>
<p>Her voice floated and echoed in the room, and the wind was still blowing outside. Just now, shangguance made a big hole in the wall. At the moment, it seemed that a lot of cold air came in from that hole.</p>
<p>After a long time, the voice of the Lich suddenly rang from the coffin: &ldquo;yes, I remember you. What do you want to ask me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaobai eyebrows a Yang, staring at the coffin, way: &ldquo;can&rsquo;t you come out to talk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Lich smothered for a moment, and then said slowly, &ldquo;I like this. Please speak quickly if you have something to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hum. &ldquo;Well, I won&rsquo;t waste my breath. I&rsquo;ll ask you, why is the sky fire born?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as this is said. The Lich was obviously surprised. After a moment, he said in a deep voice, &ldquo;what do you want to do with this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaobai said faintly: &ldquo;on that day, your master promised me, but he died before he did it. I finally knew that there was still a fish who missed the net. Naturally, I want to ask you clearly. &quot;</p>
<p>The Lich hummed and said, &ldquo;he is not my master. Only the witch lady is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaobai retorted, &ldquo;what have you done these years?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Lich was silent for a long time, and said, &ldquo;what I do is not for the people of the world to understand the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaobai was a little impatient and said, &ldquo;well, I don&rsquo;t care about your truth, and I don&rsquo;t care about it.</p>
<p>I just want to know about me. Are you willing to tell me? &quot;</p>
<p>The Lich was silent again. After a long time, he said slowly, &ldquo;the five ethnic groups in southern Xinjiang are descendants of the witch family. Do you know that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Small white eyebrow a frown, way: &ldquo;how?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Lich said lightly: &ldquo;the secret of the witch family should be inherited by the descendants of the witch family. That&rsquo;s all you&rsquo;ve said. Don&rsquo;t ask any more. &quot;</p>
<p>Xiaobai repeated the two inexplicable words of Lich several times in his heart, but there was no change on his face. He just snorted coldly. He said, &ldquo;play tricks!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, she seemed to have made up her mind and strode to the coffin where the Lich was. The room was not big. A few coffins were lying in all directions, and one was met within a few steps. Two more steps were the coffin where the Lich was.</p>
<p>In the dark, there seems to be something ready to move, staring at Xiaobai&rsquo;s figure.</p>
<p>Little white face has no expression. She was about to continue to walk forward, but in the middle of her steps, she suddenly turned from the original slow walk into a rabbit, almost like an electric shock. Her right hand suddenly stretched out, and her slender and delicate fingers seized the huge coffin beside her.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>With a roar, the huge coffin was almost twice the size of Xiaobai&rsquo;s body. Unexpectedly, Xiaobai grabbed the huge coffin with only five delicate fingers!</p>
<p>And then it was even more tongue tied. Xiaobai&rsquo;s whole body immediately floated out of the hut. With her five fingers on her hand, she actually held the huge object in her hand and took it out.</p>
<p>The huge coffin in mid air issued a low roar, &ldquo;whine&rdquo; sound low echo, huge shadow over Xiaobai&rsquo;s slender body, look really strange.</p>
<p>Even the Lich in the coffin at the corner of the wall was stunned by Xiaobai&rsquo;s strange behavior.</p>
<p>And the darkness in the room, it seems to be Xiaobai this strange behavior disturbed the general, violent air flow, emitting a sinister &ldquo;hissing&rdquo; sound.</p>
<p>Xiaobai fell in the courtyard of the Yizhuang Village. He did not hesitate. His whole body gathered. The light white light flashed on his five fingers, and his right arm swung sharply. However, it could be seen that the huge coffin was pulled by a strong force. In the swing of Xiaobai&rsquo;s arm, he ran into the hard stones on the ground.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The huge roar suddenly resounded from far and near, and the suffocating heavy flying dust instantly flew around like water vapor. The whole huge coffin was smashed by collision, and there were flying sawdust everywhere.</p>
<p>Xiaobai has already been hiding to one side. She naturally doesn&rsquo;t put the sharp sawdust in her eyes, but the dirty flying dust is unbearable to her. Through the thick smoke and dust, suddenly, there was a violent cough. After a moment, a figure tumbled out of the dust. His clothes were ragged and his face was covered with dust.</p>
<p>In the hut, the Lich felt his hair stand on end and was stunned. There was someone hiding in the coffin next to the hut. For a moment, the Lich only felt that he was really haunted by ghosts. It seemed that everything was suspicious.</p>
<p>But when he looked down unintentionally, he found that the fat man in the same coffin had a little more sarcasm in his eyes, but at the same time, he seemed to have some kind of gratification.</p>
<p>Outside the courtyard, the dust subsided, and the man staggering out of the coffin was crawling to one side, breathing in the fresh air. Xiaobai put out his hand, some smoke in front of the body, slapped a few times, will remain some of the smoke fan out, slowly approached the man.</p>
<p>The man looked back and gave a dry smile.</p>
<p>Xiaobai looked at him carefully. Suddenly, he lost his voice and said, &ldquo;how could it be you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a bitter smile, the man seemed embarrassed. He reached out to wipe the dust on his face and said with a dry smile, &ldquo;naturally, it&rsquo;s the immortal I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man who appears in front of Jiuwei Tianhu Xiaobai, unexpectedly, is the Monday immortal who claims to be &ldquo;the immortal guides the way and the iron mouth God looks like.&rdquo;. (to be continued. )</p>
