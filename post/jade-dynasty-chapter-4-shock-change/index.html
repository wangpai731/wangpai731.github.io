      <p>In the early morning, the rain finally stopped.</p>
<p>The water droplets on the tree were crystal clear, slipped quietly from the edge of the leaf, and fell down. Because of the wind, it crossed the beautiful arc in the air and hit Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>The cold coolness awakened Zhang Xiaofan from his dream. He opened his eyes and subconsciously shouted, &ldquo;Master&hellip;&rdquo; But there is no one in Shiye, only Lin Jingyu is lying beside him.</p>
<p>It seems like a dream.</p>
<p>But the broken grass temple in the distance and the sleeping partner beside him all told him that all this was true.</p>
<p>He pondered for a moment, shook his head, walked to Lin Jingyu&rsquo;s side, pushed hard, Lin Jingyu mumbled a few words, slowly woke up, rubbed his eyes, and hadn&rsquo;t spoken yet. Feeling a burst of cold, I couldn&rsquo;t help but make a hurry.</p>
<p>He opened his eyes and saw that he and Zhang Xiaofan were soaking wet, lying under a pine tree in the wild, and could not help but stunned. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sleeping at home, how did I get here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan shrugged his shoulders and said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, but I&rsquo;m so cold, let&rsquo;s go back quickly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu had all kinds of doubts in his mind, but his body was really cold. He nodded and got up and ran to the village with Zhang Xiaofan.</p>
<p>Before they arrived at the village, the two of them found that they were not quite right. Usually, at this time, the villagers had gotten up, but today they are very quiet, and they don’t even see one person. And as the morning wind blows, there is a bloody blood. taste.</p>
<p>They looked at each other and saw the surprise in the other&rsquo;s eyes. At the same time, they accelerated their pace and ran to the village. It didn&rsquo;t take long for the two to reach the entrance of the village, and looked in from the main road of the village, but they saw that on the flat ground in the middle of the village, there were more than forty households in Caomiao Village, more than 200 people, big and small, men and women, lying on the open ground. Above, his body became stiff, and he became a corpse, blood flowed into a river, flies flew, and bloody air rushed to his face.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu and Zhang Xiaofan were shocked to see this horrible scene, screamed and fainted.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Not knowing how long it took, Zhang Xiaofan Huo Ran awakened and sat up all at once, gasping for breath, shaking his hands slightly. When he just fell asleep, his brain was full of vicious faces, bloody bones, and nightmares.</p>
<p>He settled down and looked around. He saw that this was an ordinary box room with two small windows. The furnishings were simple and clean in the room. There were only a few pine tables and chairs and a kettle and cup.</p>
<p>It occupies half of the room and is a large Kang connected together with four beds. In addition to what he is lying on now, the futon beside him is a little messy, as if he had just been slept. As for the other two, the quilts were neatly folded and meticulous.</p>
<p>On the wall directly above the four beds, a banner hung with a big letter: Tao!</p>
<p>Looking like this, it looks like an ordinary guest room in an inn, or a room where a few disciples would like to live together in a room.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan sat for a while, and suddenly a thought came up in his heart: Maybe everything last night was a nightmare, right? Maybe I have been sleeping here all the time? Maybe after walking out of this room, the mother would smile and scold him as usual: &ldquo;You little lazy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He got out of bed slowly, put on his shoes, and walked towards the door step by step.</p>
<p>The door, covered up. From the cracks in the door, if there is wind blowing indiscriminately, it is cool.</p>
<p>He walked step by step, but his two small hands were getting tighter and tighter. His heart was beating fast, he held his breath, and soon he walked to the door and put his hand on the door.</p>
<p>At that moment, this wooden door was as heavy as a mountain, and it was heavy like iron.</p>
<p>He gritted his teeth, and with a cruel heart, he slammed the door open.</p>
<p>The bright light of the outdoor shone at once, narrowing his eyes. The warm and warm sunlight fell on him, with a touch of warmth.</p>
<p>However, his heart fell into the ice cellar.</p>
<p>Outside the door is a small courtyard with a few cypresses, trees and bushes, and a few fragrant flowers in between, which are open. In front of the door is a corridor leading to the outside of the courtyard. Four feet in front of the door, there are a few steps connecting the courtyard and the corridor.</p>
<p>At the corner of the steps, a child sat alone, with his hand on his cheek, sitting there staring motionlessly.</p>
<p>Perhaps the sound of opening the door alarmed him. The child hesitated for a moment and turned his head slowly.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan opened his mouth wide, and there were thousands of doubts in his heart, but when the words came to his lips, they were silent.</p>
<p>He wanted to shout again, but his heart was depressed, but he couldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Two lines of tears, just like that, fell silently.</p>
<p>The two children looked at each other in silence.</p>
<p>In the unknown place in the distance, there are clear birdsongs, blue sky and white clouds.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan sat on the other side of the steps, lowered his head, and looked at the stone paved path in the courtyard.</p>
<p>There was silence in the small courtyard.</p>
<p>Even after this, I didn&rsquo;t know how long, Lin Jingyu said slowly: &ldquo;I woke up earlier than you, there were a few people in the house at that time, I asked them, this is Qingyun Mountain Tongtian Peak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan whispered: &ldquo;Qingyun Mountain&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu said: &ldquo;Listening to them, a few disciples passing under the Qingyun Gate, seeing the village, the village&hellip;&rdquo; Speaking here, his voice could not help but choked up.</p>
<p>He reached out and rubbed his eyes vigorously, stretched his breath, and then said: &ldquo;Later they found us both behind the village and took us up the mountain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s mouth twitched, but he didn&rsquo;t look up. He said, &ldquo;What shall we do in the future, Jing Yu?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu shook his head and said sadly: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan had to say it again, and suddenly heard a strange voice from the corridor behind him, saying, &ldquo;Ah, you all wake up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two looked back at the same time and saw a young Taoist priest standing there in a blue robe, quite heroic. I saw him walking quickly and said, &ldquo;Several Masters also want to meet you and ask you some questions. You will follow me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan and Lin Jingyu glanced at each other and stood up. Lin Jingyu said: &ldquo;Yes, please ask this big brother to lead us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young Taoist glanced at Lin Jingyu, then nodded and said, &ldquo;You follow me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Following the Taoist priest, the two walked out of the courtyard, presenting a longer and larger circular corridor with a red pillar every two feet on the edge. In the middle of every two pillars, there is also an arch.</p>
<p>They walked along the corridor and passed through the arches and pillars. Only then did they find that in each arch, there was a small courtyard that was almost the same as it was just now. It seems that this is where the Qingyunmen disciples live and live.</p>
<p>Not to mention anything else, from this scale alone, such a small courtyard can&rsquo;t be less than a hundred rooms, showing how many Qingyun disciples.</p>
<p>After walking for a while, I saw the end of this corridor, but it was a towering white wall, and a door was opened below. Two thick wooden doors, up to ten feet high, almost looked up and did not know How did you find such huge woods?</p>
<p>The young Taoist ignorant, probably going in and out on weekdays, looked numb, with no expression on his face like two children, with no expression on his face, and went straight out of this door. Zhang Xiaofan and Lin Jingyu quickly followed.</p>
<p>As soon as he stepped out of the door, the two children held their breaths at the same time and looked at everything in disbelief.</p>
<p>Here, it is almost the legendary fairyland.</p>
<p>A huge square, the ground is all paved with white marble, the light is shining, and at a glance, it gives a small heart to life. In the distance, the white clouds blossomed like a gauze, and they all floated under their feet. In the center of the square, a copper giant tripod is placed every dozens of feet, divided into three rows, three in each row, a total of nine, placed in a regular manner. Dingzhong has light smoke floating from time to time, its taste is clear and not scattered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go here.&rdquo; Seemingly understood the thoughts of the two children, the young priest showed a smile on his face, let them read for a while, then woke them up and continued walking forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the &ldquo;sea of ​​clouds&rdquo; in the six sceneries of Qingyun. There are better ones ahead!&rdquo; the young Taoist walked along the road.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu couldn&rsquo;t help but ask, &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young Taoist hand pointed and said, &ldquo;Hongqiao.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two looked far away, and saw the distance ahead, at the end of the square. After the misty cloudiness, there seemed to be something shining. They accelerated their pace and walked forward.</p>
<p>Gradually, the sound of water came, and there were one or two strange noises like thunder, and I didn&rsquo;t know where it came from.</p>
<p>As they stepped closer and closer, the cloud was like a gentle fairy, gently surrounding them, gradually pulling away the vague veil, revealing a clear face.</p>
<p>At the end of the square, a stone bridge, with no seats and no pier, rises across the sky, and one end is placed on the square. There was a small sound of water, and under the sunshine, the entire bridge exuded colorful colors, such as a rainbow in the sky, falling into the world, colorful and beautiful.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan and Lin Jingyu were dumbfounded.</p>
<p>The young Taoist smiled and said, &ldquo;Come with me.&rdquo; Then he walked up the stone bridge.</p>
<p>When they stepped on the stone bridge, the two realized that there was continuous flow of water on both sides of the bridge, which was very clear, but the middle part was not dripping. Sunlight shines on the bridge through the clouds, and is refracted by the water flow, thus forming a gorgeous rainbow.</p>
<p>The Taoist priest looked at them intoxicated and said, &ldquo;You are careful, but the bottom of the bridge is a bottomless abyss. If you accidentally fall, you will die without a burial place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both Zhang Xiaofan and Lin Jingyu were startled, quickly calmed down and walked carefully.</p>
<p>The Hongqiao is extremely tall and long. The three of them walked on it, only to feel that the left and right white clouds gradually sank to their feet, and they wanted to get higher and higher. The weird voice in front is still coming.</p>
<p>After walking for a while, Bai Yun thinned out, but actually walked out of the sea of ​​clouds. Huo Ran lit up in front of him. I saw the sky as if it was washed, and the blue one as transparent. The sky is boundless on all sides; there is a vast sea of ​​clouds under it, gently floating and sinking, and at a glance, my heart is suddenly wide.</p>
<p>In front of it, is the Yuqing Hall, the main hall of the Qingyun Temple on the peak of Tongtian Peak.</p>
<p>The green hills are emerald, the palaces are standing, and the &ldquo;Yuqing Hall&rdquo; is located on the peak, surrounded by clouds, and there are a few Ruihe cranes, flying through Changming, and circling in the air, like the fairyland spirit realm, which is admirable.</p>
<p>At this time, the Hongqiao Bridge no longer rose, made an arch in the sky, and fell on the green lake in front of the temple. At the same time, Taoist songs were faintly heard in the Yuqing Hall, and the immortal sentiment was imposing. There was also that strange noise, which became louder.</p>
<p>The three of them walked down the Hongqiao to the edge of the pool. A spacious stone stairway led straight from the edge of the water pool to the gate of the Yuqing Hall. The water is green and the tranquility is like a mirror.</p>
<p>They walked up the stone steps and were about to walk towards the upper gate. They suddenly heard a roar in the depths of the water pool. Looking around, I saw a huge vortex suddenly in the center of the water pool. After a while, I saw a huge wave rolling up, and a huge figure jumped out, and the sky was filled with water.</p>
<p>But the young Taoist seemed to have been prepared for a long time. With his left hand, his body flew into the air, and he flew back two feet, and stopped in midair. And where the two children could escape, suddenly fell to the ground.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that the two of them didn&rsquo;t notice their situation at all, only staring blankly at a giant appearing in front, more than five feet tall, with a dragon-headed lion body, all over the scales, giant eyes and two sharp fangs. Glittering in the sun, with a grisly look and terrified look.</p>
<p>The monster shook his body, hula la another burst of water, and then seemed to find something, and stretched the giant head towards the steps.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan and Lin Jingyu saw that the monster had a head that was much larger than the two of them. Under the sun, the sharp teeth were clearly visible. Looking at it closer and closer, I was really scared in my heart and couldn’t help but cling to each other. Jumping straight.</p>
<p>At this time, the young priest did not know when he floated back, his palms were standing on his chest, and he respectfully said: &ldquo;Spirit Venerable, they are specially summoned by the Venerable Masters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The monster glared at him, snorted, and snorted. The eyes in a pair of big eyes actually turned, as if they were using their brains. Then he ignored the three of them, walked to the side staggeredly, fell down on the dry ground by the pool, yawned, slouched his head down, basked in the sun, and slept.</p>
<p>The young Taoist signaled that the two of them were still in shock, and said, &ldquo;Lingzun is an ancient beast that I sent to the Green Leaf Patriarch thousands of years ago. The name is&rsquo;Water Unicorn.&rsquo; It’s been vigorous. Now it’s our Qingyunmen’s Zhenshan Spirit Beast, respectfully called&rsquo;Ling Zun&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After he finished speaking, he saluted the water unicorn again. Zhang Xiaofan could see the gods, but was pulled by Lin Jingyu. When he saw him wink, he also saluted the water unicorn together respectfully. It&rsquo;s just that the water unicorn didn&rsquo;t look back, didn&rsquo;t move, but snoring loudly, I&rsquo;m afraid I can&rsquo;t see it.</p>
<p>After the three performed the ceremony, they continued on. Walking through the high stone steps, a gold plaque was seen in the distance, and the word &ldquo;Yuqing Hall&rdquo; was written on it. Before I came to the Majestic Hall, I saw the door open wide, with plenty of light inside, enshrining the three clear god positions of Yuanshi Tianzun, Lingbao Tianzun and morality Tianzun, with solemn dignity.</p>
<p>Before the Divine Throne, there were dozens of people standing above the main hall, with all manners and customs, it seemed that they were all under the gate of Qingyun. Before the crowd, there were seven sandalwood chairs, three on the left and one on the front, and another one in the center. There were only six people sitting on the top. Only the last chair in the right row was empty.</p>
