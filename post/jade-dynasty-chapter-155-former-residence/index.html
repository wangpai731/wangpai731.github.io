      <p>Morning, another day.</p>
<p>At the entrance of Sanfu Town, GUI Li stood face to face with the young man. Xiao Hui was lying on his shoulder, and the evil beast Taotie was following him, looking bored.</p>
<p>The young man took a fierce look and said with a smile, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s rare to get together. I don&rsquo;t know when to see you again. Take care of yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So are you,&rdquo; he said</p>
<p>The boy seemed to think of something and said, &ldquo;the world is in chaos now, and the situation in the north is becoming more and more tense. Brother, do you have any interest in going north to see the excitement?&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li was a little surprised and couldn&rsquo;t help looking at the young man. He saw that the young man&rsquo;s face was very self-conscious. After pondering for a moment, he said, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s talk about it! Why, are you interested in these fights? &quot;</p>
<p>The young man smiles, but he doesn&rsquo;t answer. He just bows his hand and says, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a long way to go. It&rsquo;s hard for us to meet again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said</p>
<p>The boy laughed, turned around and roared. It seemed that he was also informing the monkey Xiaohui, and then he followed up. Lying on the ghost&rsquo;s shoulder, the little ash was quite reluctant to give up, and squeaked a few times to Taotie&rsquo;s back. After a while, the figure of the mysterious youth and Taotie had disappeared.</p>
<p>The ghost looked at the direction where their figures disappeared. He was silent for a moment. Then he turned around slowly. The Sanfu town in front of him was dead and dead, and there was no vitality at all. Xiao Hui took the wine bag from his back and took a sip of it. Last night, from the cellar of the pub, the monkey found some strong liquor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go! Small ash. &quot; Suddenly, GUI Li was so insipid.</p>
<p>Xiao Hui squeaked twice, and the monkey put his palm on the devil&rsquo;s hair and fiddled with it. After a long time, he said quietly, &ldquo;after all, it&rsquo;s the place where we lived together. Do you remember that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The monkey didn&rsquo;t answer, and he didn&rsquo;t know if he understood it. It just seemed that there was a cold wind blowing through the whole cold street</p>
<p>Qingyunshan. Dazhufeng.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not easy to find the first field in Dazhu peak of Qingyun gate. At the moment, he is walking back and forth with his hands on his back in the Shoujing hall on Dazhu peak. He was in a very bad mood and his face showed anger. And there&rsquo;s a hint of impatience.</p>
<p>Su Ru, who has always been understanding, is not on the Dazhu peak at the moment. Instead, she goes to the master Shuiyue of xiaozhufeng. As for his disciples, they are always in awe of him. Seeing that Tian is not easy, she is not in a good mood, so she has long been hiding away. Song Daren, the only senior disciple who can barely speak at ordinary times, is not seen.</p>
<p>Tian is not easy to know what it is for. At present, the world is in the front of disaster. No one knows when those terrible monsters will attack. As one of the leaders of Qingyun gate, he naturally worries about it. However, because of this, after several persuasions from his wife Su Ru, Tian Buyi finally went to xiaozhufeng three days ago to propose marriage for song Daren and Wen Min to master Shuiyue for the sake of the happiness of his disciple song Daren.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, master Shuiyue didn&rsquo;t know what kind of gunpowder he ate at that time. Even Su Ru, who was present at the same time, was not allowed to face her at the same time, not to mention Wen Min, a disciple with a miserable face, refused directly and sarcastically.</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi was so temperamental that he didn&rsquo;t get angry. At the moment, he had a big fight with master Shuiyue on the top of xiaozhufeng mountain. He almost started to fight. Finally, Su Ru pulled him back to dazhufeng, and master Shuiyue was stopped by a group of disciples on their knees.</p>
<p>After this incident came back. Naturally, song Daren was extremely depressed and dejected. Tian is not easy to be in a bad mood. He is even more annoyed at his appearance. He scolded me several times in succession. He said that if he didn&rsquo;t have a wife, he would have no wife. You should devote yourself to the cultivation of Taoism. In the future, maybe you will have a blessing in disguise.</p>
<p>Naturally, song Daren did not dare to contradict his teacher, but he was submissive in his mouth, but his expression of disapproval was written on his face. Obviously, he is still nostalgic about Wen Min of xiaozhufeng. Tian Bu Yi was more angry and scolded fiercely. At the end of the day, song Daren was almost like a mouse who was afraid of the cat. He hid away all day and did not dare to see his master again.</p>
<p>Su Ru went out early that day, and specially told Tian Buyi to go to xiaozhufeng to persuade elder martial sister Shuiyue. Tian Buyi snorted a few words and sarcastically satirized Shuiyue. Su Ru ignored him and went straight away, leaving Tian Buyi sulky. But before leaving, Su Ru whispered a few words with Tian Bu Yi in private, but let Tian Bu Yi understand why the woman was so rude that day.</p>
<p>In fact, Su Ru said simply: &ldquo;I heard that the day before we went, that is, the day when Lu Xueqi returned to the mountain, elder martial sister Shuiyue summoned Lu Xueqi alone and talked for a long time. But somehow, Lu Xueqi was severely punished by the elder martial sister, and she was scolded along with other disciples.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Buyi is dull in appearance, but he is not a dull person. After a moment, he will reflect on the reason. The reason is that after Su Ru left, he often thought that he would send himself to the door to be humiliated. This tone of voice is really too much to swallow and can&rsquo;t bear.</p>
<p>Shoujingtang was silent at the moment, only the sound of Tian Bu Yi&rsquo;s footsteps came. His face changed slowly with his walking steps. Somehow, his expression became a little strange, as if he had thought of something. Lu Xueqi refused to marry face to face in the Yuqing Hall of tongtianfeng. Tian Buyi also heard the rumors about Lu Xueqi, the most outstanding talent among the younger generation of disciples.</p>
<p>But what he cared about in his heart was another person among those rumors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten years.&rdquo; He sighed slightly, his expression was a little trance, sometimes even he felt a little strange. What on earth did the little disciple who looked so insignificant at that time let himself worry about so many years?</p>
<p>Tian Buyi gave a bitter smile and shook his head. At this moment, if he felt something, he frowned and looked out of the Shoujing hall. Far away, he only heard the sound of breaking the sky in the sky. The field is not easy to micro a meditation, calm down, go out.</p>
<p>A white light flashed across the sky of Dazhu peak. It was as fast as electricity. It came straight to the top of Dazhu peak. In a twinkling of an eye, it fell six feet in front of Tian Bu Yi&rsquo;s body. The dazzling white light flickered and scattered. Xiao Yicai&rsquo;s figure appeared in Qingyun gate.</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai turned around with a smile on his face and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve met uncle Tian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi nodded. &ldquo;Well, why are you here? What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai smiles and nods, but then looks around. Slightly surprised, he said: &ldquo;Uncle Tian, why is it so cold here? How about the other younger martial brothers under your seat! Why didn&rsquo;t you see it? &quot;</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi said to himself, &ldquo;if you can see them, you will see the devil. You don&rsquo;t know where to hide.&rdquo; But on the face of it, he was as if nothing had happened. &ldquo;They were all doing their homework, so they didn&rsquo;t come out. I&rsquo;m not like you tongtianfeng here. There are so many people here. It&rsquo;s common that I don&rsquo;t see people.</p>
<p>&quot;</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai was stunned and heard that Tian Bu Yi&rsquo;s tone seemed to be a little unhappy. However, he was very deep in the city. He didn&rsquo;t hear it, as if he didn&rsquo;t feel it. He said with a smile: &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s why. Uncle Tian, I&rsquo;m here a few days ago. I came here to see you at the order of my master. I want to ask you a few questions. &quot;</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi frowned, but he was surprised and said: &ldquo;ask me for advice. What can I ask for? Elder martial brother daoxuan studies heaven and man and studies nature. What else can I do for you? &quot;</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai smiles, but does not speak, just looks at the field is not easy. The field was not easy to understand, and said, &ldquo;go in and talk about it.&rdquo; Then he turned around and went to the Shoujing hall. Xiao Yicai followed him. All of a sudden, Tian Bu Yi&rsquo;s body was stunned, and he suddenly turned back, but he looked at the room on the other side of the disciple&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai is a little strange, and also looks at that side. But seeing nothing, he couldn&rsquo;t help asking, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter, uncle Tian?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi hesitated for a moment, shook his head and said, &ldquo;no, it&rsquo;s my eyesight. How could he&hellip; &quot; He suddenly coughed and said, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go in and talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai could not help but take a look at the other side, but saw a row of houses arranged in order, silent, it seems to be too normal. At the moment, I didn&rsquo;t think much about it, so I walked into Shoujing hall after Tian Buyi.</p>
<p>After the two figures disappeared in the Shoujing hall, the quiet atmosphere was enveloped in the top of Dazhu peak. I don&rsquo;t know how long it took. Suddenly, the figure flashed in the corridor of the disciple&rsquo;s house. He was so fierce that he looked at the direction of Shoujing hall for a moment, then turned around and walked slowly along the corridor that was once very familiar with.</p>
<p>Probably because of the afternoon time! The other disciples on Dazhu peak didn&rsquo;t see the figure. In memory, the most common thing we heard here in the past was the clear laughter of little sister Tian linger, and Du Bishu&rsquo;s cry of a little dejected, because he must have lost another bet. Then, the big brother song Daren and other people&rsquo;s hearty laughter will ring, and other senior brothers will also follow the joke, and the youngest and most unimportant little disciple! Must also be in the corner of the heart of the smile?</p>
<p>Once upon a time, the past time, in the slow pace of walking, gently flipped, those old things as if engraved in every brick and stone tower here, reverberating around him.</p>
<p>From the beginning of the face of the wooden, gradually changed, once like ice shrouded expression quietly receded, the past time is so moving, even after many years, he still can not forget.</p>
<p>If, if If nothing has changed</p>
<p>He stood in the corridor between the light sunshine, and sat down slowly on the low railing of the corridor. The warm and warm sunshine of Dazhu peak shone on his face, as if it were the appearance of ten years ago.</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>There were footsteps and voices of conversation coming from behind. They were he Dazhi, the fourth disciple of dazhufeng, and Du Bishu, the sixth disciple of dazhufeng. Two people came to this place side by side, and at the moment of their appearance, the ghost had suddenly disappeared like a ghost. The mountain wind blew, and the branches and plants moved together. No one knew where he was hiding.</p>
<p>He Dazhi and Du Bishu obviously didn&rsquo;t find anything. They spoke in a low voice and walked slowly by. Du Bishu also carried a wooden bucket with half a bucket of water in it, and a rag was beside it to see where he was going to clean it up. Seeing the two of them walk forward, before long, they come to the door of a room. Du Bishu shrugs his shoulders to he Dazhi, and he Dazhi smiles, and they walk in together.</p>
<p>A moment later, the ghostly figure appeared from a corner outside the corridor, looking at the front with complex eyes. The two former senior brothers went into the room where he used to live when he was a disciple of dazhufeng. However, the room should have been abandoned for many years. Why did the two elder martial brothers go in?</p>
<p>It drifted past in silence.</p>
<p>As like as two peas in the dream, he was in the doorway. This little courtyard was exactly the same as the scene of the year. There are still gravel paths, there are still green grass, and even the little pine is still growing there. It&rsquo;s just that over the years, it&rsquo;s been a lot stronger.</p>
<p>The sound of water came from the room, and then the voices of Du Bishu and he Dazhi came out: &ldquo;fourth elder martial brother, talk about it. It&rsquo;s been so many years. Why does master want us to clean this room? Isn&rsquo;t it intended to make me suffer? &quot;</p>
<p>He Dazhi said with a smile: &ldquo;Stinky boy, you want to be lazy again, don&rsquo;t you? I can tell you that Shifu is on fire for the elder martial brother recently! Don&rsquo;t provoke him, or master, he will have to peel your skin.</p>
<p>&quot;</p>
<p>Du Bishu chuckled twice and said, &ldquo;elder martial brother, you are kidding me again. How dare I offend master. It&rsquo;s just that the younger martial brother has been away for more than ten years, but the master still tells us to keep the place as it is and clean it every day. I really don&rsquo;t know what his old man is thinking about. &quot;</p>
<p>The figure standing outside the room. Standing still, he slowly lowered his head.</p>
<p>In the room, he Dazhi was silent for a while, but he sighed and said in a low voice: &ldquo;although master has never talked about younger martial brother in these years, we all know that his elder martial brother is the one who loves him most.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Du Bishu&rsquo;s voice said: &ldquo;yes! I can see that. To be honest, sometimes I miss my younger martial brother very much. But what&rsquo;s the use of that? Younger martial brother, he has already become another person. Will he go back to dazhufeng, become Zhang Xiaofan again, and be our seventh younger martial brother again? &quot;</p>
<p>Outside the window, the ghostly look more and more indifferent. The body is also straight, only two hands, clench into a fist, the more grip more tight.</p>
<p>Can we go back?</p>
<p>The steps you take in time, the road you cross, years later. Remember looking back? Do you want to go back?</p>
<p>The sun is warm and shining on the body, but it seems to be in an ice cellar!</p>
<p>He Dazhi and Du Bishu also kept silent. It seemed that the topic they mentioned inadvertently was boring and speechless. After a while, they came out with the bucket in their hands. He Dazhi gently closed the door of the house and watched the green grass and the pine branches shaking in the small courtyard. Although the spring was full of vitality, it always had a sense of loneliness. It seems that the owner of this house is not there, and this piece of spring is also quietly faded.</p>
<p>He shook his head, sighed and left with Du Bishu.</p>
<p>After a long time, GUI Li came out slowly from behind the pine tree. The familiar mountain wind blew on his face and moved his hair. He went to the door, raised his right hand and put it on the door.</p>
<p>His movements were slow and slow. He seemed to have a heavy weight on his hands. Even the expression on his face seemed to be out of breath. However, that kind of strange and inexplicable feeling, like an invisible force, finally opened the door!</p>
<p>——Like, push open a window of the past years, see the past time.</p>
<p>As like as two peas, a familiar bed, a familiar desk and chair, and a hanging banner on the wall that seemed to be slightly yellow after years, even the kettle teacup on the table looked exactly the same as it was then.</p>
<p>Who knows how many times has this simple and simple room appeared in the dream? Even the air here seems to have a light feeling of the past. He slowly walked into the room, walked to the bedside, sat down slowly, and gently stroked the bedding along the bed with his hand. The soft feeling passed through the palm.</p>
<p>Who saw, he suddenly bit his lip, so hard, so deep!</p>
<p>In Shoujing hall, Tian Buyi and Xiao Yicai sit down together. Tian Buyi seems to be a little upset. Facing Xiao Yicai, his eyes are looking elsewhere, as if he is thinking about something. It was not until Xiao Yi coughed and called out, &ldquo;Uncle Tian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi woke up with a start. He nodded and said, &ldquo;well, OK, go ahead! What do you want, master daoxuan, to make a special trip for your proud disciple? &quot;</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai said with a smile: &ldquo;I dare not. Well, my teacher has two main things to do. I want my disciples to ask martial uncle Tian. &quot;</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi said, &ldquo;Oh, you say so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai said: &ldquo;one of them is that the number of Taoist friends who came to Qingyun Mountain recently is still increasing. Many people have been received by other channels. Tongtianfeng has arranged more than 100 Taoist friends in the houses on the hillside. But even so, the accommodation is still not enough, so the master wants his disciples to beg for help from his uncle. Can you arrange some more Taoist friends on the Dazhu peak? &quot;</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi raised his eyebrows and looked at Xiao Yicai. Xiao Yicai looked embarrassed, but he still said with a smile: &ldquo;martial uncle, this is also because of the current world disaster, we have no choice but to do it. Moreover, we in Qingyun gate always regard ourselves as leaders of the right way, so we can&rsquo;t push the Taoist friends out of the door?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi snorted and said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m a fool. Those so-called righteous Taoist friends really fight with those monsters, and less than 30% of them can help. Most of them come to seek refuge because of our reputation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai gave a bitter smile and said, &ldquo;Uncle Tian is very serious, but even so, we can&rsquo;t push people out of the door. If we really want to do this, what will the righteous world think of us? For the sake of the overall situation, I asked Uncle Tian to help me a lot.</p>
<p>&quot;</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi rolled his eyes and suddenly seemed to think of something. His eyes suddenly brightened, his mouth showed a trace of ridicule. Then he coughed, and his face showed a righteous and awe inspiring expression. He said, &ldquo;since elder martial brother daoxuan has said that, I can&rsquo;t refuse. Anyway, it&rsquo;s for the sake of the justice of the world and the overall situation, so let&rsquo;s do it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai was overjoyed and said, &ldquo;thank you very much, martial uncle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi smiles and suddenly raises his hand and says, &ldquo;wait a minute. I haven&rsquo;t finished yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai was stunned for a moment and said, &ldquo;what? Uncle Tian, please say so. &quot;</p>
<p>Tian Buyi said with a smile: &ldquo;since the current catastrophe, we should take the overall situation into consideration. I heard that among the seven veins of Qingyun, there is one pulse, er, which seems to be the one with more female disciples&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai was still smiling all over his face, but half of his face was stiff, and he gradually couldn&rsquo;t smile.</p>
<p>Tian Buyi still smiles at himself and says, &ldquo;I remember that the terrain was vast and I had been there a few days ago. There are so many empty rooms! Why did the leader&rsquo;s elder martial brother never think of this place? &quot;</p>
<p>After a long time, Xiao Yicai said, &ldquo;Uncle Tian, this, this&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Field not easy to hum a, chubby face eyes to the sky, silent. Seeing his appearance, Xiao Yicai shook his head and said, &ldquo;yes, after I go back today, I will report to my teacher and ask him to be the master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian was not easy to speak, his face did not change, just nodded, but his heart was very happy, snickering.</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai calmed down for a moment and then said, &ldquo;well, uncle Tian, there is this second thing that is more important than the one just now. My teacher has told me again and again. Please think carefully before answering.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian can&rsquo;t see that Xiao Yi&rsquo;s face is serious, which is quite different from that just now. Obviously, it seems that this matter is very important. She can&rsquo;t help but be stunned and nodded: &ldquo;Oh, what&rsquo;s so serious? You can say it.&rdquo; (to be continued. )</p>
