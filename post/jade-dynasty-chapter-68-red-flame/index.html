      <p>The old blood sucking demon snorted, but there was no fear at all. His haggard face was fierce. He said, &ldquo;in those days, you righteous people, but depending on the large number of people, do I really fear you? &quot;</p>
<p>As soon as his hands vibrated, the red flashing skull in front of him &ldquo;whine&rdquo; across the air, flying rapidly around him, and his eyes began to turn red.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not easy for Tian to breathe deeply and be alert. A hundred years ago, he was an outstanding person under the Qingyun sect. He was also one of the main forces in the pursuit of the remaining evils of the demon sect. He also had a hand with the old blood sucking demon. He knew that this person could not be ignored, and the blood sucking method was even more important.</p>
<p>At this time, the dark clouds are gathering gradually. The trace torn by the sword that is not easy to break the sky just now is gone, and the night is dark again.</p>
<p>Vaguely, the sound of the sea waves from afar, mixed with the sharp and huge wind, gradually surged. It&rsquo;s like a long roar hidden in the deep sea, floating gently under the sky in the night.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan woke up and felt his chest was very upset. At this moment, he suddenly heard someone &ldquo;eh&rdquo;. A white jade hand reached out and gave him a few gentle massages.</p>
<p>A moment later, the Qi and blood that had been trapped in his chest seemed to be flowing away. Even his spirit was suddenly better.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan looked up and saw that it was Su Ru, the teacher&rsquo;s mother, who was holding herself, smiling and speechless.</p>
<p>He blushed and whispered, &ldquo;thank you, Shiniang. &quot;</p>
<p>Su rurou said, &ldquo;are you ok? &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan nodded and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired now, nothing else? &quot;</p>
<p>Su Ru smiled and nodded, then chuckled, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s all right. Now I see your master angry for you! &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was startled. He followed Su Ru&rsquo;s eyes and was shocked for a while.</p>
<p>Under the dark sky, between the low black clouds, there was a blazing and shining light group, reflecting the sky for half a day. Even the edge of the dark cloud is as if it were edged with light.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not easy for the field to stand on the cloud like the ancient god of fire, turning the &ldquo;red flame&rdquo; into a burning flame. Turn it into a dragon flying all over the sky, tear up the dark clouds and rush up to nine days.</p>
<p>And the old blood sucking demon, which has disappeared, is in the sky beside the cloud. There are huge skeletons, roaring and roaring. Changes in the wind and cloud, there are dark and fierce blood, rising from the sky, fighting with the fire dragon.</p>
<p>The sky is full of black clouds. Now they are boiling and roaring. Looking from the ground, the two men are like the gods and demons of the nine heavens. They fight angrily.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan only saw it. I admire my master so much that I can only see the roar of the fire dragon, its voice moving all over the country, and its presence in the clouds. It&rsquo;s really like the fire dragon that was summoned by three evil foxes in the black stone cave some days ago, but it&rsquo;s much more powerful.</p>
<p>Think of here, his body suddenly a shock, only feel from the xuanhuojian on his right arm. Suddenly there was a burst of heat rising up, like being stimulated by something, walking all over the body.</p>
<p>Su Ru, who was beside him, suddenly felt something and turned around. Looking at him, he asked, &ldquo;Xiaofan, why is your body suddenly so hot? Isn&rsquo;t it a fever after injury? &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was surprised. She didn&rsquo;t want to feel so sharp. At that time, I didn&rsquo;t know what to say, so I just said, &ldquo;nothing, nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru frowned and was about to ask. Suddenly she felt something. She turned her head and looked back. Only to hear the footsteps in the forest, but for a moment, more than a hundred people came out of every corner, all of them were right people. Among them are the FA Xiang and FA Shan of Tianyin temple, Li Xun and Yan Hong of burning incense Valley, and the Taoist Cangsong is the first.</p>
<p>Su Ru stood up and said with a smile, &ldquo;elder martial brother Cangsong, you are also here. &quot;</p>
<p>Cang song nodded slightly, and said lightly, &ldquo;younger martial brother Tian is here to show his power. It&rsquo;s amazing. We are not blind or deaf, so we came here to have a look. &quot;</p>
<p>Su Ru frowned slightly and felt that there was a stab in his words. But before waiting for her to say anything, the disciple of dazhufeng, who was following her, saw Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s bloodstained body and his face languishing on the ground.</p>
<p>Tian ling&rsquo;er cried out and ran up. Song Daren, Du Bishu and he Dazhi were also worried and followed her. Unexpectedly, they just ran a few steps. Suddenly, they only felt that the white shadow flashed, and a figure rushed up faster than them. After a careful look, it was Lin Jingyu.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu flashes to Zhang Xiaofan, squats down, reaches for his arm, looks pale, and says, &ldquo;Xiaofan, are you ok? &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan felt the worry in his eyes, his heart warmed, nodded and smiled, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ok, it&rsquo;s OK.</p>
<p>&quot;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu looked up and down at him, and then at the wound on his chest. Then he was relieved and took a long breath, saying, &ldquo;who hurt you? &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan pointed up and said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the demon. I heard my master call him just now. It&rsquo;s like a blood sucking old demon? &quot;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu was shocked. It seemed that he knew the devil and said, &ldquo;this old man is born? &ldquo;Then he looked up.</p>
<p>At this time, Tian ling&rsquo;er and others came to Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s side to ask questions. Zhang Xiaofan looks at Tian linger&rsquo;s concerned eyes, but he lowers his head and answers his elder martial brothers&rsquo; questions in a low voice, saying that he has no problem.</p>
<p>At this time, the fight was raging in the sky. Lin Jingyu stood beside Zhang Xiaofan, looked up for a while, and suddenly said, &ldquo;Xiaofan, I can&rsquo;t imagine that your Shifu doesn&rsquo;t look very good at ordinary times, but the Taoist method is so high! &quot;</p>
<p>When Tian linger heard this, she was angry. Since she was defeated by Lin Jingyu at the door of her house, she saw that the boy was very unhappy. Then she snorted and said, &ldquo;my father has a profound Taoist skill. Where can you see it? &quot;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu frowned, looked around, but saw Tian linger&rsquo;s eyes pressing, not showing weakness. He was stunned for a moment, then he suddenly smiled and said, &ldquo;Tian Shimei, what milk said is. &quot;</p>
<p>Tian ling&rsquo;er smothers for a while, but doesn&rsquo;t expect that the arrogant young man of that year has suddenly become better. But seeing Lin Jingyu with a smile on his face, he looks to another place. She followed Lin Jingyu &rsquo;s eyes, but she saw him standing in the distance beside Taoist Cangsong Qi Hao, looking at each other and smiling.</p>
<p>How clever Tian ling&rsquo;er is! In a flash, he thought that Lin Jingyu must have always respected senior brother Qi Hao, so he was embarrassed to argue with him. Although her own heart is not embarrassed, but at the moment, her eyes are connected with Qi Hao, and her heart is still sweet.</p>
<p>Su Ru&rsquo;s eyebrows were slightly wrinkled. She had listened to the words of these young people just now. The speaker didn&rsquo;t mean to. But the listener was thoughtful. After a while, she quietly looked at Taoist Cangsong and saw Taoist Cangsong looking up. His face is expressionless, but his eyes are bright, his eyes are twinkling, he has been staring at Tian&rsquo;s hard figure, and he does not know what he is thinking?</p>
<p>At this time. Only listening to the roaring wind, the fire in the sky, and the blood light in the sky, it was obvious that the two men had reached the most important moment of fighting. Taoist Cangsong suddenly said coldly, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine that the old blood sucking demon is so brave and dare to challenge here.</p>
<p>Qi Hao! &quot;</p>
<p>Qi Hao stood beside him and took a step, saying, &ldquo;master, what is your order? &quot;</p>
<p>The Taoist Cangsong glanced at the sky and said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s up to you, Mr. Tian. That old devil can&rsquo;t last long. You take someone around to decorate it. This time, you can&rsquo;t let the devil run away. &quot;</p>
<p>Qi Hao answered, reached out his hand and called Lin Jingyu back. Then he turned around and informed several other schools, such as FA Xiang and Li Xun, and was discussing with himself.</p>
<p>Su Ru slowly walked to Taoist Cangsong and smiled, &ldquo;elder martial brother Cangsong, how can you see that it&rsquo;s hard to win? &quot;</p>
<p>Taoist Cangsong glanced at Su Ru, and there was a smile on her expressionless face. &ldquo;Younger martial sister Su, is Nai going to play a joke on my elder martial brother who is not successful? &quot;</p>
<p>Su Ru shook her head and said with a smile, &ldquo;give me ten courage not to joke on your head, but I sincerely ask for advice! &quot;</p>
<p>Taoist Cangsong smiled and said, &ldquo;younger martial sister Su is always smart. My qualifications are far superior to those of my unfulfilled elder martial brother. Why be so humble. Although the blood sucking old demon is not inferior, it also has blood skeletons. It looks like the blood is shining and fierce. But in my opinion, although the power is fierce, the magic weapon is located in the upper right three points. Blood red light seems impure, blood skeleton seems to have a small damage. It&rsquo;s nothing in ordinary times. It&rsquo;s nothing to do with the evil way. It&rsquo;s a little refined. But now it&rsquo;s his biggest flaw in front of younger martial brother Tian. &quot;</p>
<p>When he said that, he paused for a moment, and there seemed to be a cold flash in his eyes, but his voice was still peaceful. He said, &ldquo;look at younger martial brother Tian calmly, and control the red flame sword with the green cloud formula, and it can turn into a red fire dragon. Although the red light of the blood skeleton is rich, it will retreat as soon as it touches the red fire dragon, which is not his enemy. In addition, younger martial brother Tian has a keen eye. His moves directly attack the upper right three points of the blood skeleton. The old blood sucking demon seems arrogant, but in fact, he is already left and right, and will surely lose. I don&rsquo;t know if younger martial sister Su thinks what I said is wrong? &quot;</p>
<p>Su Ru said with a smile, &ldquo;elder martial brother, I also heard what you said before I knew it. &quot;</p>
<p>Taoist Cangsong smiled lightly, turned his head, looked up, and suddenly lowered his voice, but in a peaceful tone, said slowly, &ldquo;younger martial sister su.</p>
<p>&quot;</p>
<p>Su Ru said, &ldquo;what, senior brother Cangsong? &quot;</p>
<p>Taoist Cangsong&rsquo;s eyes are still on the two people who are fighting fiercely in the middle of the air, but his mouth is clear and clear: &ldquo;younger martial brother Tian has broken through the state of Taiji Xuanqing and Shangqing in one fell swoop since one hundred years ago. It seems that the Taoist method has made rapid progress again these years! &quot;</p>
<p>Su Ru&rsquo;s heart was shocked, but her face didn&rsquo;t show it. She smiled and said, &ldquo;brother Cangsong, you are so flattering. It&rsquo;s not easy for him to have the leader and your talent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taoist Cangsong shook his head slowly, with a smile on the corner of his mouth, and said, &ldquo;a hundred years ago, we were going to defeat the evil cult in one fell swoop. Mr. Tian, Mr. Zeng, Mr. Feng Huifeng, Mr. Shang of Chaoyang peak, and Mr. Wan of changmen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru suddenly called out in a low voice, &ldquo;senior brother Cangsong. &quot;</p>
<p>As soon as Taoist Cangsong was shocked, he seemed to think of something, nodded his head, and then said, &ldquo;we are going after some of the demons in the demon sect, going deep into the wilderness. At that time, younger martial brother Tian has broken through to the upper Qing Dynasty. Master Wan said to us, younger martial brother Tian seems to be dull, but he is intelligent, especially persevering, which is even more rare. In the future, he will have an unlimited future in the cultivation of Taoism. &quot;</p>
<p>Speaking of this, he smiled and said, &ldquo;younger martial sister Su, the man and the milk also know each other. What he said and his vision and insight, surely there will be no doubt about the milk! &quot;</p>
<p>Su Ru smiled faintly, but she had no words. She turned her head and looked up at the sky.</p>
<p>The blood sucking old devil was in the air, howling fiercely. He looked fierce, but he was more and more frightened. A hundred years ago, he also had a hard time with Tian. Although his Taoism was not low at that time, he was still sure to win with this blood sucking method.</p>
<p>However, a hundred years later, the fight broke out again. The fire dragon turned from the red flame fairy sword shook the &ldquo;dark and fierce blood&rdquo; sent by his blood sucking method to urge the blood skeleton. It was not only not downwind, but also gradually overwhelming.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not the only headache. Just now, when he was fighting with Zhang Xiaofan, I saw that he was a young Qingyun generation. To my surprise, the array of &ldquo;Five ghosts in charge of spirits&rdquo; was somehow broken by him.</p>
<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s no wonder that the blood sucking old demon can&rsquo;t think about it. His blood skeleton is originally a fierce thing. If he meets some supreme divine soldiers in the orthodox legend, such as Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s &ldquo;Tianya divine sword&rdquo;, he will naturally get some success and experience from his Taoism. Naturally, you will be more careful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s magic weapon, the fire staff, but it&rsquo;s really too weird. There&rsquo;s no sense of magic from head to foot. It&rsquo;s true that the evil spirit is very heavy, but it&rsquo;s more like the evil magic weapon of the old blood sucking demon. After seeing it, the old blood sucking demon doesn&rsquo;t pay attention to it.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s firebrand in his hand, the &ldquo;blood bead&rdquo; sucks the blood essence of the living creature, and has no choice but to suck the old demon&rsquo;s ghosts. But the other half, the &ldquo;soul taking&rdquo;, is the legendary supreme evil thing, which burns the spirit and spirit for thousands of years. It is the ancestor of the ghost and spirit in the world. Just then, Zhang Xiaofan used his blood essence to stir him into the body of the ghost. At that time, he turned the ghost into a clean one, which was more crisp than any righteous divine soldier.</p>
<p>In normal times, the old blood sucking demon was surprised at most. After all, Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s Taoist practice was far away from him. Just now, the old blood sucking demon took charge of his family skills, and Zhang Xiaofan was invincible. But when he gets on the right track, it&rsquo;s not less than him. It seems that it is not easy to have a hidden potential to overcome the field, and this little hidden danger is exposed.</p>
<p>The five ghost spirit control array and blood sucking method are all driven by blood skeletons, and one of the life ghosts is suddenly broken. The blood skeletons were also slightly damaged at the time, but now, they have become the biggest danger of the blood sucking old demon.</p>
<p>Tian is not easy to live in the first bamboo peak of Qingyun gate for nearly a hundred years. Not only is his Taoism far superior to Zhang Xiaofan, but also his insight and fighting experience are 100 times better than him. They can only fight for several rounds. It can be seen that there is a place on the blood skeleton of the blood sucking old demon with impure light and color. At that time, he attacked it with all his strength. At the beginning, it was nothing, but for a long time, the blood sucking old demon felt very hard.</p>
<p>In the sky, the fire dragon roared and clawed, and the huge skeleton of the blood sucking old demon gradually became dim. On the contrary, the flame was so hot that it almost dyed the whole night sky red.</p>
<p>The old blood sucking demon cried bitterly in his heart and hated that he was too much than tuoda. He thought that in the past hundred years, he had been painstakingly cultivating himself, except for those top people in the right way, he was not afraid of the rest. In fact, he asked secretly this time. He knew that those who were deeply afraid of didn&rsquo;t come, which reassured him. But now, after a hundred years, it&rsquo;s hard for Tian to enter the country so fast.</p>
<p>He was in a hurry. He looked down unintentionally and was surprised again. I only saw the figures shaking on the ground. I&rsquo;m afraid there aren&rsquo;t more than dozens of people. Most of them are in the right way. Some of them are familiar with each other, especially the Taoist Cangsong standing at the front. He was also one of the Qingyun people who chased him.</p>
<p>This time, the old blood sucking demon was even colder. He immediately wanted to go.</p>
<p>Then, in a flash of his mind, suddenly the fire dragon roared in front of him. His voice was like thunder. The old blood sucking demon was shocked. He looked up and changed his color. Suddenly, the fire light of the fire dragon in the middle of the sky was very bright. After a while, it didn&rsquo;t attack. Instead, it drew back to the field like a long whale sucking water and turned into a red flame fairy sword again. But the remaining fire light didn&rsquo;t recede a little and lit up the whole sky.</p>
<p>It is not easy for the field to face frost and look solemn. The red flame lies across the chest, holding the Dharma formula in the left hand, treading on seven stars and walking seven steps in the air. The red flame fairy sword stabs the sky and recites the formula in the mouth: &ldquo;nine sky xuancha turns into a divine thunder. Huang Huang Tianwei, lead it with sword! &quot;</p>
<p>Above the ground, especially in the Qingyun gate, there was an uproar. All the people, especially the disciples of dazhufeng, were very excited. Even the Taoist Cangsong beside them was pale.</p>
<p>The originally low dark clouds suddenly turned, such as boiling water in a pot, and the wind in the heaven and the earth was whistling. A moment later, from the dark clouds, there was a rumble of thunder, almost beside the two people, blowing.</p>
<p>In an instant, the sky moves!</p>
<p>The whole Liubo mountain seems to be shaking, and around the island, the originally calm sea water is also incredibly boiling.</p>
<p>A flash of light, like an ancient light, rises suddenly in the sky, pierces the black cloud, tears the sky, like a proud God, who falls into the world and stops at the burning point of the sword.</p>
<p>At that moment, people in the sky suddenly couldn&rsquo;t see his figure. The blazing and dazzling light covers the world.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a wind. It&rsquo;s blowing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s up, everyone&rsquo;s clothes</p>
<p>Between heaven and earth. Suddenly there was a silence!</p>
<p>All of a sudden, the thunder rang again! In the roar, heaven and earth changed color, and the huge unparalleled light burst out. Through all the black clouds and the red sun in the summer, he rushed to the blood sucking old demon irresistibly.</p>
<p>A moment later, the old blood sucking demon was covered by a light, and even the red light of the blood skeleton disappeared in an instant.</p>
<p>A figure fell from the cloud.</p>
<p>Tian is not easy to hold red flame tightly, breathe deeply, and his face is slightly pale. But he stood in the cloud like a God.</p>
<p>After the initial shock and quietness, there was a sudden uproar in the righteous crowd. The voice of surprise and admiration was heard all the time. All the disciples of dazhufeng were well behaved. Zhang Xiaofan was stunned and worshiped. His eyes finally left the field. He saw that all the people around him were smiling, and Tian linger was even more happy.</p>
<p>The rest of joy. Zhang Xiaofan suddenly thought of something. He turned to look at xiaozhufeng. As expected, Lu Xueqi was looking up in silence, staring at Tian&rsquo;s hard figure in the air. He was stunned.</p>
<p>The same formula of &ldquo;magic sword against thunder&rdquo; is not easy to use in Tian&rsquo;s hands, but its power is more than ten times that of Lu Xueqi?</p>
<p>The old blood sucking demon was as red as blood and fell out of control. Taoist Cangsong hummed and winked at Qi Hao and others. Qi Hao knows. With a wave of his hand, six or seven disciples jumped out of the path and rushed to the place where the old blood sucking demon fell. At the same time, all the magic weapons in his hands came out.</p>
<p>The blood sucking old demon was in the air, his body was trembling, his hands were waving rapidly, he seemed to resist, but he didn&rsquo;t move twice. The red light flashed on his face, and suddenly he took a breath of blood, and his face was as dead as dust.</p>
<p>Everyone laughed and saw that the old devil was unable to resist. Seeing that Qi Hao and others were about to capture the old blood sucking demon alive, they suddenly heard Su Ru suddenly cry out, &ldquo;be careful! &quot;</p>
<p>Qi Hao, Lin Jingyu and other people were shocked. They just felt a flash of purple and black air in front of them. Several strong forces came from the dark. They flew in front of the two people, a disciple of Qingyun and a monk of Tianyin temple. They were immediately beaten to spit blood and flew back.</p>
<p>Qi Hao and other people were shocked, and they just lived in their body shape. But in a moment, the strength had rushed in front of them, which was overwhelming and overwhelming. Qi Hao shouted, &ldquo;get back! &quot;</p>
<p>At the same time, he clenched his teeth, the ice fairy sword in his hand flashed again and again, and in an instant, he spread seven ice walls in front of him, and luoup gate and his fellow disciples protected him. But before other people could step back, these forces had already hit the ice wall. They rushed to the ice wall like a broken bamboo.</p>
<p>Qi Hao took the lead. In a moment, he almost stopped breathing, but saw green light flash by. Lin Jingyu, seeing that elder martial brother was in a critical situation, recklessly took up the &ldquo;dragon cutting sword&rdquo; and rushed over.</p>
<p>Qi Hao lost his voice and said, &ldquo;younger martial brother Lin, hurry up! &quot;</p>
<p>But how fast these powers are like mountains and seas, they rush to the front in an instant. Seeing these two people are like huge waves and boats, they will inevitably have to close their eyes and die, but suddenly they only listen to someone drinking later:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Demon! &quot;</p>
<p>The wind rose suddenly, and for a moment, if those strange powers met their opponents, &ldquo;pingpong&rdquo; went on for a while. The wind was loud and stopped suddenly. Qi Hao and Lin Jingyu were grabbed by the collar and leaped back for several feet. At least they came back with a life.</p>
<p>The two settled down and saw that the one who saved Qi Hao was Taoist Cangsong, and the one who brought Lin Jingyu back was Su Ru. At the moment, the one who stood at the forefront with them was several other sects, such as &ldquo;the great Reverend&rdquo; and other predecessors, as well as the Tian Yi who didn&rsquo;t know when to fall from the cloud.</p>
<p>In the distance, I saw the purple light and black air flashing. After a while, I caught the old blood sucking demon. A wave of shaking, showing a few people, and behind them in the woods, but also sounded countless footsteps. There is a lot of shadow in the dark. I don&rsquo;t know how many people hide in it. I only look at the ten people who show up and walk out, most of them are from the demon sect.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was surprised and stood up. He saw only a few people standing in front of the people in the demon sect. It&rsquo;s the ghost king who catches the blood sucking old demon, but there are three people beside him. One is a bald old man, the other is a fierce looking but very short dwarf, and the other is a white faced scholar. He is smart and outstanding. He can&rsquo;t see any evil spirit with a smile on his face.</p>
<p>In the right way, Taoist Cangsong and his neighbor Tian are not easy to look at each other. Their eyes seem to twitch slightly. They hum and say coldly, &ldquo;OK! Good! You old guys are finally born one by one. (to be continued). )</p>
