      <p>Qingyun Mountain, xiaozhufeng.</p>
<p>The mountains blow through the green bamboo forest, with bursts of bamboo waves, echoing in the valley forest.</p>
<p>Wen Min looked up at the sky and saw that the sky was cloudless and blue. It seemed to have a transparent feeling. She took a deep breath and felt better. However, she did not slow down. She walked through the bamboo path, and soon she saw the little bamboo house where master Shuiyue was resting.</p>
<p>She went to the door, tapped on the door and said, &ldquo;master, I&rsquo;m back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue&rsquo;s voice came out and said, &ldquo;is it min&rsquo;er? Come in! &quot;</p>
<p>Wen Min opens the door and goes in. The bamboo house is not big. After entering the door, she can see Master Shuiyue sitting on the couch with her knees crossed. She went aside and said, &ldquo;master. &quot;</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue slowly opened his eyes, looked at her, and saw that she was alone, and said, &ldquo;how, did you not find anyone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wen Min nodded and said, &ldquo;yes, I&rsquo;ve been to sister Lu&rsquo;s residence twice today, but she&rsquo;s not here. I&rsquo;ve heard from other sisters, but no one has seen her. Did she go down the mountain on business? &quot;</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue said without expression: &ldquo;Xueqi always knows the weight. If you go down the mountain, you will tell me. If you can&rsquo;t find her, it&rsquo;s probably&hellip;&rdquo; Her voice stopped for a moment, as if thinking of something, then changed the topic. Team Wenmin said: &ldquo;since you can&rsquo;t find her, then forget it. Anyway, there&rsquo;s nothing important. Go down and practice your homework by yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wen Min nodded and answered. Then she saluted master Shuiyue. Then she went out. Before leaving, she gently closed the door of the bamboo house.</p>
<p>After the sound of Wenmin&rsquo;s footsteps outside the house gradually disappeared, master Shuiyue&rsquo;s always calm face slowly floated a trace of thoughtful expression. For a long time, she sighed in a low voice.</p>
<p>The light came in from the window of the bamboo house, making the delicate and simple bamboo house bright. Master Shuiyue got down from the bamboo couch and went to the door. Open the door and go out, leaving a piece of silence in this small space.</p>
<p>The moon watching platform is a very secluded place on Xiaozhu peak. When the moon is in the sky at night, the scenery here is very moving. It is said that on the night when the moon is full, the moon is like who. After being refracted by the white stone of the moon watching platform, it can reflect the whole mountain range of xiaozhufeng. It is really a wonder in the world. It is also one of the famous scenery on Qingyun Mountain.</p>
<p>In the past ten years, Lu Xueqi often danced swords against the moon in the dead of night. Master Shuiyue is the teacher who raised Lu Xueqi since childhood. No one knows Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s mind better than her mother. Now I heard that Wen minchao couldn&rsquo;t get Lu Xueqi. After a moment&rsquo;s thinking, she expected that Lu Xueqi would come to this secluded place.</p>
<p>Along the way, the bamboo grove is flourishing, and at the same time, it is farther and farther away from the bustling halls and pavilions in the front mountain. Although master Shuiyue&rsquo;s own room is also in a secluded place, walking along the path and listening to the endless bamboo waves on both sides of the road, he still can&rsquo;t help feeling empty.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if Xueqi likes this place because of this feeling?</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue thought so quietly in his heart and walked toward Wang Yue platform. Sure enough, when she stepped on the moon watching platform, she saw the familiar figure in white standing quietly on the boulder on the edge of the lonely cliff. The mountain wind was blowing incessantly in the endless abyss, and Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s white dress was dancing with the wind.</p>
<p>Tianya is still in her hand. Quietly emitting a light blue glow.</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue looked at her back and acquiesced for a long time. There seemed to be some complicated emotion in his eyes and his eyes flashed. After a long time, she coughed gently.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi immediately found something strange behind her, and was slightly surprised. At this time, it was Bai Yue. No sister of xiaozhufeng had ever come to this remote place. How could someone come here today. Moreover, the visitor came near behind him, but he didn&rsquo;t find it at all.</p>
<p>She quickly turned around and saw the figure of her teacher master Shuiyue. Lu Xueqi was stunned for a moment. She quickly floated down from the boulder and came to master Shuiyue. She bowed her head and saluted, &ldquo;master, how did you come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue felt pity in her eyes. She pulled Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s skirt with her hand, and said in a soft voice, &ldquo;the vigorous wind blowing here is quite cold and fierce. Although you have a deep Dao, you should not blow more. It is no good in the end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi hung her head and said, &ldquo;I know. Thank you for your concern.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue took a look at her, softened his voice, and said, &ldquo;do you have some resentment for the teacher in your heart?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi was surprised and said, &ldquo;master, how can you say that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue said faintly, &ldquo;I told you this secret and let you go down the mountain. However, after several twists and turns, you had to kill the martial uncle Dazhu Fengtian, who was made by the ancient sword of the dead immortal.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s still in front of that person. &quot;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi looked gloomy, but she slowly shook her head and said, &ldquo;master, don&rsquo;t say it. My disciples have already thought about it clearly. It&rsquo;s the will of God. Master, you can&rsquo;t think of it. Besides, at the last moment, although uncle Tian can&rsquo;t speak, I can clearly feel his intention. Uncle Tian asked me to do that sword. &quot;</p>
<p>Her voice stopped, and her expression suddenly showed a bleak meaning, like self mockery, like a bitter smile, a faint way: &ldquo;as for with that person I didn&rsquo;t hope at all. The rules and regulations of the sect and the morality are like mountains. I understand it very well. Uncle Tian of dazhufeng was the teacher who raised him up from a young man. He always regarded him as a father, but now he died in my heart. It would be unbearable if I were him.</p>
<p>Speaking of this, she raised her head in silence, looked at master Shuiyue, and said with a sad smile, &ldquo;master, you don&rsquo;t have to worry about my disciples, i. I&rsquo;ve really looked at it already! &quot;</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue felt a pain in her heart. With her experience, Lu Xueqi thought how she could not see it. This fact was too unexpected and there was no room for turning around. Although she firmly opposed the feelings of this disciple, she could not bear it at this moment.</p>
<p>Just can&rsquo;t bear, in the end or no help, master Shuiyue sighed gently, shook his head, soft voice way: &ldquo;snow Qi, you don&rsquo;t too sad, don&rsquo;t hurt the body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi forced a smile and said in a low voice, &ldquo;master, you come to this remote place to look for me, but what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue nodded and said, &ldquo;good. There is one thing here, though it is not big, but it seems very strange, and I think about it. You&rsquo;re the only one</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; Lu Xueqi said</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue looked at her and said, &ldquo;in fact, it&rsquo;s still a secret. By the way, when you said that after the accident, did you personally send the remains of GUI Li and Tian Bu Yi to Da Zhu Feng? &quot;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s face changed slightly when she heard the word &ldquo;Gui Li&rdquo;. But then he nodded his head and said definitely, &ldquo;yes, when he was called The man was seriously injured. Although they were not worried about their lives, it was too hard to take the remains of Uncle Tian back to the mountain alone. Moreover, it was not suitable to delay the matter for a long time. So the disciple gave them a ride. But I also sent the matter to the big bamboo peak. As soon as they landed, I left. &quot;</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue nodded and said, &ldquo;good. That&rsquo;s the weirdness.</p>
<p>&quot;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi was slightly surprised and said, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter, master?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue said: &ldquo;as you said, as early as two days ago, Tian Buyi&rsquo;s body had returned to the Dazhu peak, but until now, there is no message of mourning on the peak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi was shocked and frowned.</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue walked to one side with his hands down and looked out from afar. He saw clouds and mist in the distance. Dazhufeng looms in that direction</p>
<p>After reading for a long time, she said, &ldquo;Tian Bu Yi is the leader of the dazhufeng school, and his position is very important. As soon as the news comes out. Even the real person of Zhangjiao has to go to sacrifice, but is it not a strange thing to keep secret on the big bamboo peak? &quot;</p>
<p>She stopped for a moment, turned her head to look at Lu Xueqi and said, &ldquo;in addition, I sent someone to find an excuse to go to the dragon head peak in the morning. He found that Tian ling&rsquo;er was still on the dragon head peak and knew nothing about his father&rsquo;s death. &quot;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi was silent for a long time and said, &ldquo;I understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue nodded and said, &ldquo;you are smart. I don&rsquo;t need to say anything more. In fact, I don&rsquo;t doubt anything. Su Ru is my younger martial sister. I&rsquo;m just like a sister, and I don&rsquo;t care for others. I&rsquo;m more worried about her husband and wife&rsquo;s affection, and I&rsquo;ve done stupid things for a while. But dazhufeng doesn&rsquo;t feel bereaved. As the head of dazhufeng, it&rsquo;s not convenient for me to visit. In addition, there are many hidden twists and turns in this matter, which makes it inconvenient for others. So I have to let you go again It is. &quot;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi nodded and said, &ldquo;I know that in this case, if there is no other loss, I will pass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue nodded slightly and said, &ldquo;well, be careful all the way. If there is any change, please come back early and tell me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi answered, saluted master Shuiyue, turned around, and the magic light of Tianya sword at the beginning was lit up. People walked with the sword, only to hear a sharp cry through the sky. The man had turned into a blue light and left the sky.</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue looked at Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s slightly hasty figure, but it didn&rsquo;t look like her calm wind. She knew that the stubborn and infatuated apprentice was strong on the surface and put it down in his mouth, but in his heart, he could not let go.</p>
<p>She was silent for a long time, but the thickest one was a low sigh, shook her head, and walked down the platform and went straight.</p>
<p>Thousands of miles away, Huqi mountain.</p>
<p>In the cold stone room, the frost still curls up, and the quiet woman in green also lies quietly on the ice stone platform as usual.</p>
<p>Lanji, covered with gauze, stood alone in the cold stone room, staring at Biyao for a long time, and sighed gently, with a lot of helplessness.</p>
<p>In Youji&rsquo;s heart, there are too many helplessness recently, which makes her puzzled, distresses her and makes her confused gradually.</p>
<p>First of all, the ghost King seems to have completely changed his personality. Although the former resolute ghost king is still brilliant, his intention of killing is becoming more and more serious in his daily life. This is only a few days. Because a few small things disobey his meaning, the ghost king has killed several people, including a high-ranking ancestor of the ghost king.</p>
<p>And these little things, put two years ago, the ghost king just afraid will be a laugh. You Ji clearly felt that the ghost King&rsquo;s clan was already full of fear and fear. No one knew that one day he would suddenly die because of some trivial matter.</p>
<p>What makes Youji more distressed is that when she accidentally ran into the ghost king and GUI Li, they started to fight. Although it was only a few times, Youji was not an ordinary religious crowd. She was one of the four holy envoys of the ghost King sect. She opened it clearly. Since then, there was a deep crack between the two men. She saw it Come on, the ghost King&rsquo;s hands may not have killed his heart.</p>
<p>Her eyes darkened. Looking at Biyao, she is still sleeping quietly. It was for the sake of this respectable and beautiful woman that the two men came together, but what was it for. After ten years, how could this happen between them?</p>
<p>You Ji really dare not imagine, if one day, those two men kill each other, what kind of result will be? And now it seems. Such a thing may not be impossible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Man, hum, man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Youji read a sentence with hatred in her heart, upset. When her eyes turn to Biyao, she turns to Teng Xin. She has always been regarded as her daughter&rsquo;s child. Every time she sees Bi Yao, she can&rsquo;t help feeling sad.</p>
<p>When she was alone here, she thought silently. Suddenly, the heavy stone door of the cold stone room made a low mahogany sound, and someone opened it from the outside.</p>
<p>You Ji turns her head and looks. After a while, I saw the ghost King&rsquo;s figure appeared at the door and walked in slowly. I couldn&rsquo;t help being stunned for a moment.</p>
<p>Then the ghost king also saw you Ji, nodded to her, and said faintly, &ldquo;you are here too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Youji suddenly sneered, staring at the ghost king, but did not speak.</p>
<p>The ghost King frowned, and a trace of anger passed in his eyes. Now he is. It seems that he is very easy to get angry, which is quite different from his usual temperament. But Youji is not an ordinary person after all, and his father and daughter relationship is more incomparable to others. The ghost king has always treated Youji. It&rsquo;s also different. At the moment, he could only say, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>You Ji snorted and sneered, &ldquo;do you remember a daughter lying here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost King frowned and said, &ldquo;what are you talking about? How can I not remember? I have only such a child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You Ji Su Rong said: &ldquo;well, you tell me, how long have you not come here to see Biyao?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost king was stunned. But he couldn&rsquo;t speak for a moment. He seemed to have a trace of guilt in his eyes. He softened his voice and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not right. Recently, the educational administration is in a difficult situation. I&rsquo;m in a bad mood, so I don&rsquo;t want to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You Ji said coldly: &ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t understand. It&rsquo;s not only you, but also the ghost. What&rsquo;s the matter? You two seem to have changed a lot! &quot; At the end of the sentence, her voice was still slowly low.</p>
<p>But the ghost king didn&rsquo;t seem to care about you Ji&rsquo;s tone, but after he heard the word GUI Li, he suddenly turned pale and snorted, and said, &ldquo;the upright is ignorant. Don&rsquo;t mention him in front of me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Youji looked at the ghost King&rsquo;s face and saw his anger. When he wanted to say something, he suddenly felt tired. For a while, she felt frustrated. She shook her head and said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s all right. Whatever you do. I really can&rsquo;t control it. I don&rsquo;t care about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she turned to the door. The ghost king looked at her back and frowned. He wanted to say something to her, but he didn&rsquo;t say anything.</p>
<p>Seeing that Youji&rsquo;s hand was about to reach the heavy stone gate, suddenly, her hand suddenly stopped in mid air. Almost at the same time, the ghost King standing behind her felt something, and his eyes flashed suddenly.</p>
<p>An invisible but powerful force, like a surging tide, swept through the depths of the earth under their feet. The ghost king and Youji are both people with profound Taoism. They are all changed by this strange power for a time.</p>
<p>However, Youji is shocked, the ghost king is really surprised with a little joy, the essence of his eyes twinkles constantly.</p>
<p>This strange tide wave after wave, straight like the turbulent sea, never stop. Slowly, Youji clearly felt that the ground under her feet was trembling slightly, and the shaking was slowly increasing.</p>
<p>Her face turned pale. The power of this sudden surprise was unimaginable and shocking. She could hardly resist it. Looking back in horror, she saw that the ghost king had a strange look and bright eyes, but she didn&rsquo;t know what she was trying to write, but on his face, there was not much fear.</p>
<p>At this moment, all of a sudden, this room was surrounded by countless thick mountain rock walls, and the indestructible ice stone chamber burst out several continuous crackles, as if something had exploded.</p>
<p>This time, the ghost king was as pale as Youji.</p>
<p>Shocked, I quickly looked at it, but I saw a few short cracks on the originally solid stone wall. From the fracture, several small stones were constantly falling down. At the same time, the ground under their feet seemed to shake more and more seriously.</p>
<p>Fortunately, this strange force seems to have found its outlet when tearing the hard rock on the mountain wall. Soon after the mountain wall split, they felt the mysterious and mysterious power deep in the earth under their feet, which quickly weakened, and soon disappeared.</p>
<p>Youji stood in silence for a long time, her eyebrows tightened. If the startling cracks were still on the stone wall from time to time, she almost thought that it was just her own illusion. But the crack is like a knife, but it is really carved on the very hard stone wall.</p>
<p>Youji turns her head and looks at the ghost king. Somehow, the ghost king just looks at her, then turns around and looks at Biyao.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know what this is about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>You Ji&rsquo;s heart suddenly flashed a shadow, there is a bad premonition.</p>
<p>The ghost King slowly shook his head and said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;ll send someone to survey the terrain and see if it&rsquo;s an earthquake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Youji pondered for a moment and then said, &ldquo;this should not be an earthquake. Just now, the surging force was like a huge wave and tide, and there was clearly a chill and murderous spirit in it, which was definitely not a natural disaster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost king was silent. After a moment, he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make a detailed investigation on this matter, so don&rsquo;t worry about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Youji gazed at his back for a long time. After a while, she did not speak any more. She opened the heavy stone door and went out.</p>
<p>The stone door closed again slowly in the heavy roar, and the cold stone room fell into a silence again. Looking at that peaceful and slightly smiling and peaceful face, the ghost King&rsquo;s deep and sharp eyes, finally slowly become soft down.</p>
<p>He sat down in silence on the side of the ice stone bed. He only looked at Biyao in his eyes, with unspeakable yearning and pain.</p>
<p>It seems that only at this time, when he is alone in the face of his daughter, will show some of these weak.</p>
<p>Just, who knows?</p>
<p>Or is it the ghost king himself that he will understand?</p>
<p>No one knows.</p>
<p>Outside the cold stone room, Youji left here for a few steps, then stopped, frowned and looked around.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know just now and then, because she was in the extremely heavy and solid cold stone room, although she felt the mysterious power, the damage caused by the surrounding was not serious. Of course, the power to tear several cracks in the extremely hard stone wall is very important.</p>
<p>However, outside the cold stone room, what she saw was a lot of serious phenomena. In the corridor opened by the ghost King&rsquo;s family and extending in all directions, there were pieces of fallen rocks everywhere. In the distance, there was no sound of people crying and hurting.</p>
<p>Obviously, that mysterious force had a more serious impact on huqishan than expected.</p>
<p>In this busy time, Youji also found another unusual thing, that is, in these well ventilated corridors, I don&rsquo;t know when to start, the air is filled with a faint smell of blood.</p>
<p>No matter where she went, she could feel it everywhere. Although this strange breath is not strong, but you Ji still feel very uncomfortable, but now the trouble for her, it is too much, and there is no mind to bother this.</p>
<p>For her, now she is like a breath in her chest, in any case, just want to rush out of the mountain to take a breath outside. That&rsquo;s what she thought and did.</p>
<p>You Ji&rsquo;s figure soon disappeared in the corridor in the middle of the mountain, but the faint bloody air still seems to be still here quietly (to be continued. )</p>
