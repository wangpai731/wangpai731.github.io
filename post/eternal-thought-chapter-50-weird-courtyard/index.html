      <p>At the moment when the gate of the house opened, Du Lingfei and the three of them looked at it with vigilance. Bai Xiaochun was nervous and took out a large number of runes and pasted them in front of him, making a crackling noise all over his body.</p>
<p>The figure that appeared, holding a lantern in his hand, stood in the open door. His whole body seemed to blend with the darkness and looked at the three people in a secluded way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s the matter with the three coming to my family in the twilight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the dim light of the lantern, the three men vaguely saw that this was a young man. His eyes were calm, his face was pale, and he seemed to have no blood color. He was wearing a blue robe.</p>
<p>Seeing someone appear, Feng Yan and Du Lingfei are relieved. Although the gloomy feeling of this place is still there, it is much less.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This Taoist friend, the three of us are disciples of Lingxi sect. We have something important to ask about during this visit.&rdquo; Feng Yan holds his fist and opens his mouth.</p>
<p>Du Lingfei noticed the protective light curtain on Bai Xiaochun and frowned.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun didn&rsquo;t pay attention to Du Lingfei. He didn&rsquo;t know why. He felt a strong sense of crisis from the house and the young people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It turns out to be a Taoist friend of Lingxi sect, so let&rsquo;s talk about it in detail&hellip;&rdquo; The young man opened his mouth gently. In the shaking of the lantern above his head, and in the dim light, his face looked uncertain. He stepped back a few steps and turned away.</p>
<p>The gate of the house is open, as if waiting for Bai Xiaochun to enter.</p>
<p>Feng Yan hesitated for a moment. Du Lingfei followed him. Bai Xiaochun looked around, bit his teeth, and carefully followed him into the house.</p>
<p>After they entered, the door closed with a bang, and the two lanterns swayed more violently. The two stone lions below suddenly turned their eyes and slowly turned to blood.</p>
<p>In the house, there is a bluestone path with some vegetation and rockery around. However, even if there is moonlight, it looks hazy. Only the youth in front of the house has a weak light from the lantern in his hand, which flickers with the youth&rsquo;s advance.</p>
<p>Four people walk on this blue stone path, cold and silent around, as if with the outside is two worlds.</p>
<p>On the right side of the people, there were several fruit trees with many red fruits on them. There was no wind in the house, but the fruit trees suddenly shook themselves and made a rustling sound.</p>
<p>Du Lingfei and Feng Yan were on the alert immediately. Bai Xiaochun was at the back and kept looking around, especially the shaking fruit trees, which made him feel strange.</p>
<p>Slowly, he smelled a smell of blood. Although it was light, it did exist.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s heart cluttered and was about to open her mouth.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, the fruits of those fruit trees fell off the tree one by one, fell to the ground and then rolled forward. On the surface of the fruit trees, there were children&rsquo;s smiling faces, as if someone had painted them on purpose, laughing at Bai Xiaochun and others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Lala.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They also grew hands and feet, holding hands one by one, and quickly ran towards Bai Xiaochun and others, surrounded by Feng Yan, Du Lingfei and Bai Xiaochun, all of whom had changed faces, and gave out happy laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My aunt said that we should be obedient, not cry, but laugh. Ripe fruit is the most beautiful.&rdquo; These little white circles are turning round and round.</p>
<p>With their approach, a sweet face, but this sweet smell in the mouth, but people seem to vomit out the viscera.</p>
<p>Some fruits even ran to the front of the youth. The young man turned a deaf ear and trampled on a few fruits. However, the broken fruits still got up, with a smile, and continued to sing inexplicable songs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the hell!&rdquo; Feng Yan&rsquo;s eyes showed the essence of the light, a swing of the sleeve, immediately there was a wind blowing, rolled a lot of fruit flying, fell to the ground one by one broken, but still got up, surrounded the people again, laughter is still the same.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s goose bumps all over her body have come out. All the protective light curtains outside her body are turned on.</p>
<p>Du Lingfei&rsquo;s face was pale. Looking at the fruits singing hand in hand, she looked frightened and held back the nausea in her heart. When she bit her silver teeth, her Phoenix eyes showed a fierce look. When she was about to pinch the Jue, all of a sudden, these fruits showed fear one by one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here comes my aunt!&rdquo; They quickly regress back to the fruit trees, jump up and return to their respective positions, smiling faces disappear and return to normal fruit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a kind of spiritual fruit brought back by my ancestors from the depths of the Luoxing mountains. I always like singing. How do the three Taoist friends think of their singing?&rdquo; The youth of the Luo Chen family in front of him did not turn back, and his voice came out when he continued to move forward.</p>
<p>Feng Yan and Du Lingfei look ugly. They hum and walk away.</p>
<p>After Bai Xiaochun, a chill rises in his heart. As he continues to move forward, he suddenly finds that the sound of footsteps here seems to be One more!</p>
<p>Cluttered, cluttered, cluttered</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know when, the footstep sound here is no longer four people&rsquo;s, but five people!</p>
<p>Perhaps, since they entered the house, there has been such a footstep, but they were attracted by the fruits and did not pay attention. After the silence at the moment, it sounds very clear.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun listened carefully, and his whole body suddenly trembled. He found that the extra footsteps were behind him. His neck was chilly, as if someone was breathing against his back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You Did you hear the footsteps One more! &quot; Bai Xiaochun felt that his hair was suddenly rising, and Feng Yan in front of him also changed his look. He also heard the footsteps.</p>
<p>Du Lingfei&rsquo;s pupils contracted and she was short of breath.</p>
<p>The three people&rsquo;s feet stopped in an instant, and with their pause, the footstep sound also disappeared.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun felt fluffy in the bottom of his heart, gritted his teeth and turned back suddenly. Suddenly, he saw a woman in red standing behind him!</p>
<p>The woman&rsquo;s red dress was fluttering and her face was as dead as ashes. She looked at Bai Xiaochun with a sly smile, and her lips moved. It seemed that she was saying something.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s not enough fire. Help me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This sudden scene made Bai Xiaochun jump up suddenly and let out a shrill scream. When she stepped back, the woman in red suddenly turned into a red shadow and disappeared in a flash.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun was pale and looked at it immediately, but there was nothing around Only his voice, turned into echo, echoed around.</p>
<p>Du Lingfei and Feng Yan are shocked. They look around one after another. Although they don&rsquo;t notice any figure, they are all frightened at the moment.</p>
<p>At this time, a woman&rsquo;s song came from the dark and silent house. It seemed like a lullaby to coax a baby to sleep. But in this quiet and dark house, it made people feel numb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good boy, go to bed, the wind blows, the fire is shaking, don&rsquo;t scratch, don&rsquo;t cry&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Play tricks!&rdquo; Feng Yan is nervous, pinch Jue between immediately a flying sword appeared, in the surrounding.</p>
<p>At the same time, the young man with the lantern in front of him gradually turned around. In the dim light of the lantern in his hand, his whole person looked blurred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you go? Come on, come on. &quot; There was a smile on the youth&rsquo;s face, which was very strange.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We still don&rsquo;t go in. We&rsquo;re here to investigate the disappearance of a colleague. Do you remember that my colleague came here five months ago?&rdquo; Feng Yan took a deep breath and asked fiercely in his eyes.</p>
<p>Du Lingfei has already taken out the magic weapon, and now his mind is highly concentrated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No The young man with the lantern opened his mouth in a soft voice, and his voice seemed to blend with the woman&rsquo;s song.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why are the members of the Daoyou family absent?&rdquo; Du Lingfei suddenly asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you have something to go out, have you finished asking?&rdquo; Young people smile more, even the corners of the mouth are raised boss, looks very uncoordinated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all. We&rsquo;ll leave.&rdquo; When Feng Yan opened his mouth, his body immediately retreated. Du Lingfei retreated as quickly as Du Lingfei. As for Bai Xiaochun, he had already regressed before them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since you don&rsquo;t want to come in, stay Stay here with us&hellip; &quot; The young man&rsquo;s laughter spread out, and the corner of his mouth was directly torn into a huge gap, which almost split his head!</p>
<p>The lantern in his hand, in this instant, directly turned green, making the whole house more dark, and his body, at the same time as the words spread out, flew directly to Feng Yan.</p>
<p>Feng Yan&rsquo;s face changed. He pinched a key and the flying sword roared away. However, the young man did not dodge. With a bang, he let the flying sword penetrate his body. With a strange smile, his chin hung on his face and rushed to Feng Yan.</p>
<p>Feng Yan was short of breath, and his body was constantly retreating. He took out a black pill under his teeth and smashed it directly to the ground. The roar reverberated. The pill exploded at the moment it touched the ground.</p>
<p>The young man who rushed to Feng Yan was the first to bear the brunt. When he retreated, there were countless damaged places on his body. However, he did not seem to know the pain. He still grinned strangely, turning like a kite and continuing to pounce on him.</p>
<p>And the place where the pill is exploded, there are countless crisscross stripes. Those stripes are like strands of dead gas, which are rapidly knitting and seem to be healing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is the array, this is the Yin Ming array!&rdquo; When Feng Yan saw the stripes, he cried out.</p>
<p>At the same time, at Du Lingfei&rsquo;s feet, the bluestone slabs actually moved. A pair of eyes appeared, and even hands grew. That hand was as thin as firewood, like a corpse. If you look carefully, you can see that many silk like things are drilling around inside Grab Du Lingfei&rsquo;s leg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It hurts us when you step on it&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, come on, be here with us&hellip;&rdquo; In those bluestone boards, there are more voices coming out. These sounds are so loud that people will be shocked after hearing them.</p>
<p>Du Lingfei looked pale and pinched a finger. At once, a small flag flew out of her storage bag, forming two fog beasts to guard her side. In front of her, there was a flying sword whistling out. When the light of the sword was shining, she cut off and grasped her leg arm, and her body quickly retreated.</p>
<p>And Bai Xiaochun here, in this moment, his ear that woman&rsquo;s song, suddenly big up!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t scratch, don&rsquo;t cry&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
