      <p>Zhang Xiaofan didn&rsquo;t expect that Biyao had such a big reaction. She was shocked and pointed to the top of the cave and said, &ldquo;there are some red stones&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biyao immediately approached and looked at the top of the cave. Sure enough, through the water drop, there were seven and a half palm sized red stones inlaid in the top of the cave. The texture of the stone was the same as the stone beside, except for the color.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan saw that the face of Bagao was tense, and he was absorbed in looking at the stone wall on the top of the cave. He was also curious. He stood up and looked there. He saw that the seven red stones on the top of the cave were lying askew on the top of the cave, which looked like a strange spoon shape.</p>
<p>Especially that color, I don&rsquo;t know how many years it has been washed by water in this cave, it is still as red as blood. Even when crystal clear water drops flow through these red stones, they are reflected as red as blood, and then drop down, just like blood drops from the top of the cave. However, once away from the red stones, the water drops will return to their original transparent appearance.</p>
<p>He looked at it, and suddenly heard the words in the mouth of Bagao beside him: &ldquo;blood dripping hole, blood dripping hole, blood dripping Ha! &quot; All of a sudden, Bagao was very happy. Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s face suddenly turned white when she clapped Zhang Xiaofan with her right hand. The power of this palm was very strong.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was furious and was about to ask, but he saw the woman smiling at her face. He didn&rsquo;t care. He was excited and said, &ldquo;well, you black heart old man, how can you build the blood hole in such a place? No wonder we haven&rsquo;t found it dozens of times in 800 years.&rdquo; Zhang Xiaofan was surprised, but he thought about it in his mind. Then he thought that when she met Biyao, she had asked her about the &ldquo;blood dripping hole&rdquo;. Suddenly, she understood it, hummed and said, &ldquo;demon and evil way!&rdquo; Biyao is in a good mood at the moment, but she doesn&rsquo;t get angry. She says with a smile: &ldquo;I am the devil, so what? I also want to thank you for helping me find this place! &quot; Zhang Xiaofan was even more reluctant by the eldest brother, especially after seeing the more beautiful smile of Biyao at the moment, he felt that he had helped the devil cult fairy by accident. I&rsquo;m afraid that I will be punished if I know later.</p>
<p>But just think of here, but then think of, I can&rsquo;t even go out at the moment. What else did you think about? I let out my anger and sat down without a word.</p>
<p>At the moment, Biyao is so happy that she doesn&rsquo;t care about Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s inexplicable expression. The demon sect has a long history, and there are many factions in the sect. There is a large number, sometimes rise and fall.</p>
<p>Eight hundred years ago, heixin old man was in the blood refining hall, which was known as the first sect of the demon sect at that time. He was strong and had many experts. Heixin old man himself was the ancestor of the cultivation. However, after years of changes, they fought with the right way several times. The blood refining hall gradually declined and was replaced by other factions.</p>
<p>In today&rsquo;s world, the four major sects of the demon sect stand side by side. They are Hehuan sect, Wandu sect, changshengtang and guiwangzong, respectively. But when it comes to the prosperity of momentum, there is no comparison with the blood refining hall, which was in full swing at that time.</p>
<p>In the demon sect, it has been said for 800 years that the main heads of the blood refining hall died in the battle after the battle of the demons. However, most of the secret weapons were collected in a secret place called &ldquo;blood dripping hole&rdquo; under the &ldquo;wanbat ancient cave&rdquo;, the foundation of the blood refining hall.</p>
<p>In the past eight hundred years, I don&rsquo;t know how many people in the demon sect secretly stole the ancient cave of wanbat. Even the dead spirit pit has been found many times, but they all came back empty handed.</p>
<p>Although Baguio himself is young. However, he is already an important person in the &ldquo;ghost King clan&rdquo;, one of the four major sects. This time, he came to the &ldquo;dead spirit pit&rdquo; and other dangerous places, which was entrusted by the leader of the ghost King clan. Now, in the past 800 years, countless things that predecessors could not do were in front of her. How unhappy she was, for a moment she completely forgot that she was in the Jedi.</p>
<p>Biyao was so happy that she stared at the top of the cave. Then she got up and reached out carefully to touch the red stones, but her hands were cold. But it is no different from the stone beside. She knocked the red stones gently again, but there was no response. At this time, her face was more nervous than excited.</p>
<p>She then pulled, knocked, lifted, smashed and pulled. All the techniques were used, and every red stone was touched. But everything was as usual, and nothing unusual happened.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan looked down, a burst of joy in his heart, couldn&rsquo;t help laughing: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think this is a blood hole at all, you guessed it wrong!&rdquo; Biyao has no choice but to fall to the ground and glare at Zhang Xiaofan, but she has doubts in her heart. Is it really her mistake?</p>
<p>For the next two hours, Zhang Xiaofan sat on the ground and watched the young girl in the water green clothes, frowning, pacing back and forth, pondering hard and using the new methods to deal with the red stones from time to time, but none of them failed.</p>
<p>Looking at it, Zhang Xiaofan suddenly felt that he was hungry when he cried twice.</p>
<p>He reached into his arms and wanted to take some dry food with him to satisfy his hunger. Unexpectedly, it was empty. Most of it was accidentally lost in the water just now. At this time, I was crying bitterly. At present, I was hungry. There was nothing to eat in the cave. The water in the small pool in front of me was very clear, but it was so clear that I didn&rsquo;t even see a small fish or shrimp.</p>
<p>Seeing that the hunger in his stomach was becoming more and more serious and more and more painful, Zhang Xiaofan had nothing to do but to take a sip of clear water and drink it, but he was totally helpless.</p>
<p>He sighed miserably. It seemed that he was going to starve to death here.</p>
<p>At this time, Biyao was not hungry at all. Her whole mind was on the seven red stones, but after a long time of busy, she finally got nothing and sat down, but her eyes were still staring at the red stones, stunned.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan looked at her like that and couldn&rsquo;t help reminding her, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the use of that? We don&rsquo;t want to go out any more. We&rsquo;re afraid we&rsquo;ll starve here first.&rdquo; Biyao&rsquo;s body moved for a moment. It seemed that she remembered that there was a little disciple in the middle of the way around her. She turned her head and looked at him. Suddenly she said, &ldquo;are you hungry?&rdquo; How can Zhang Xiaofan lose his face in front of her? He immediately raised his head and said, &ldquo;No.&rdquo; &ldquo;Goo, goo&rdquo;, his stomach seemed to be against him. After he finished, he called twice.</p>
<p>Baguio couldn&rsquo;t help but burst out laughing. Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s face was red, and he felt so great that he wanted to have a crack in it.</p>
<p>Biyao smiled twice, but took out a piece of dry food from her arms and handed it to Zhang Xiaofan. She said positively, &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;d better help me think about how to open the door of the blood hole!&rdquo; Zhang Xiaofan hum, turn to the beginning, don&rsquo;t look at the dry food, said categorically: &ldquo;you think a dry food can buy me. Delusion! &quot;</p>
<p>Biyao was stunned for a moment, then smiled: &ldquo;you are wrong, I mean we are in the Jedi now. If there is no way out, I will have to die here. But there is a blood dripping hole in front of us. If we find out where the hole is, there will be another way out Zhang Xiaofan thought about it, but there was some truth in it. He wanted to live. It&rsquo;s a way out to find the blood hole first, or we&rsquo;ll have to wait for death.</p>
<p>But he was rather stubborn. He just ignored the dry food handed by Baguio, stood up and looked at the red stones again. Baguio was not angry. He just looked at his figure, smiled, stood up and looked at the cave top.</p>
<p>The seven red stones arranged like spoons are just in the top of the cave.</p>
<p>Except for the red color, it was totally the same as the surrounding stones. Zhang Xiaofan watched for a while, but he got nothing. He wanted to go up and knock one by one, but he gave up when he thought that there was no way for Biyao to try.</p>
<p>The two men looked up at each other from the beginning, and then they sat on the ground tired. Later, Zhang Xiaofan did not care about any etiquette at all, so did the dying man. Actually lying on the ground, looking at the top of the cave, I don&rsquo;t know how long it took, but I still didn&rsquo;t find anything. In the end, I fell asleep.</p>
<p>It took Zhang Xiaofan a long time to wake up and look at it, but she still stared at the seven red stones.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s heart at the moment also had some admiration for this woman and sat up. Unexpectedly, the body just moved, and suddenly the stomach was &ldquo;cooing&rdquo; again. It seemed that he was very hungry and didn&rsquo;t give the host face at all.</p>
<p>There was no other sound in the cave except for the sound of water dripping. The sound of &ldquo;Gugu&rdquo; rang here. It was introduced into the ears of Baguio at that time and turned to look over.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan is very embarrassed. He can die, but he can&rsquo;t lose his face. He immediately turns his head to the other side and doesn&rsquo;t go to see Baguio, but he still feels a heat on his face. He goes to the small water pool and wants to hold some water to drink, which helps him.</p>
<p>The clear water in the pool is only afraid of the mountain springs gushing out from the bottom of the ground. Outside the cold, it is clear and refreshing, more like some sweet taste. But after Zhang Xiaofan took two drinks, the hunger in his stomach was even stronger.</p>
<p>After all, water can&rsquo;t be used as food. Zhang Xiaofan sighed and stared at the water, but saw the water drop from the top of the cave and into the water, making ripples and floating out in circles. Under the water, his haggard face is reflected, slightly red</p>
<p>A little red?</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan suddenly realized how the reflection in the water would appear red. He looked at it quickly. He saw some red spots on his reflection face in the water, but then he found that they were wrong. After a careful look, he looked up to the stone wall. It was the red stones on the top of the cave that reflected in the water and overlapped with his own reflection that made this situation.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan breathed a sigh of relief, but at this time, he moved in his heart, stepped back and gazed at the water, but saw the ripples of the water, and finally gradually emerged the reflection of seven red stones in the water pool.</p>
<p>Because of the reflection, their arrangement is no longer that strange spoon shape, but a little like a person&rsquo;s palm.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan stood in place, did not speak for a while, at that moment he suddenly hesitated, just like suddenly feeling that he stood at an intersection, do not know where to go?</p>
<p>The feeling flashed, and he turned around and said, &ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; Biyao is still looking at the stone wall above her head, and casually says, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t call you hello, that&rsquo;s what you said when you met me at the beginning.&rdquo; Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s words were almost poured back to his mouth, but somehow he had extraordinary endurance towards the light woman and said, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo; &ldquo;My name is Baguio,&rdquo; said Baguio, turning to smile</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan read two sentences in his heart, shook his head and said, &ldquo;come here and have a look!&rdquo; Baguio was slightly surprised. She stood up and came over, saying, &ldquo;what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan pointed to the surface of the water, and Biyao leaned over to see that the water was rippling, but after concentration, he slowly saw the reflection of the seven red stones in the water like the palm of his hand.</p>
<p>As soon as Biyao&rsquo;s body shook, she quickly turned around and said, &ldquo;this is&hellip;&rdquo; Zhang Xiaofan shook his head and said, &ldquo;I also saw it unintentionally, maybe not or maybe&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before he finished, Baguio had already cut off: &ldquo;no matter what, we should try.&rdquo; He said nothing nonsense and stepped into the water with a crash.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was surprised, only in a moment. The dripping water has wet the clothes of Biyao, but she didn&rsquo;t care about it at all, just held her breath and waited.</p>
<p>As she stepped into the scattered water, it gradually subsided. Biyao quietly waited for the reflection of the seven red stones to reappear in the water. Zhang Xiaofan looked from the shore, only to see the pearly crystal water drops falling gently from the air, on the hair and shoulders of this beautiful woman, on her face and clothes.</p>
<p>Clear water from her black hair. Slide down, slowly flow through her white skin, as if even her face is pretty almost transparent.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan suddenly looked crazy, but felt that the original sound of the water in the cave suddenly went away. In his eyes, there was only this beautiful woman standing in front of him, like a lotus in the water, who came to him with the moving beauty.</p>
<p>The reflection of seven red stones slowly emerged, like a palm, floating quietly in the water. Baguio is sure of the position.</p>
<p>Slowly extend the right hand, in the palm position, press down.</p>
<p>Her jade like hand went through the gentle water wave and stretched down. The reflection of the red stone in the water was floating quietly. The water was sparkling, and I didn&rsquo;t know where it reflected the light, shining the beautiful woman&rsquo;s face slightly.</p>
<p>The water pool is very shallow, and Biyao&rsquo;s hands quickly touch the bottom of the pool. There is a thin layer of sand and stone on the bottom of the water. At the tentacle, Biyao feels that there are five slightly raised places under her hand, which are the five fingertips of her palm. There was a joy in her heart. Flick with your hand. Sure enough, there are five small stones inlaid in the bottom of the earth under the sand and stone, with a faint red light.</p>
<p>Baguio didn&rsquo;t want to think much. She pressed her fingers down. Then look up.</p>
<p>There was no movement.</p>
<p>The joy on Biyao&rsquo;s face suddenly stopped, her eyes met Zhang Xiaofan on the bank for a moment, and then turned back.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan just wanted to say two words of comfort to her. Suddenly, she saw what seemed to come to her mind again. She looked at the surface of the water and looked for the reflection of the other two red stones carefully. As expected, she found two more small stones. This time, she seemed nervous. She carefully pressed her left hand, and then, at the same time, she pressed seven small stones.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, Zhang Xiaofan and Biyao thought they had failed again. There was silence in the cave, but there was no other sound except the dripping.</p>
<p>However, just after they had been waiting for a long time, a harsh but heavy &ldquo;click&rdquo; sounded in the cave.</p>
<p>At the same time, Biyao and Zhang Xiaofan saw that behind the water curtain, the stone wall, which was once seamless and hard, had retreated back completely. Although it was slow, a new hole finally appeared.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan stared at the opening of the secret cave. He was a little excited and scared. But in his deep heart, he felt as if he didn&rsquo;t want to admit it. He was still curious.</p>
<p>What will be in the important land of the demon cult in the past 800 years?</p>
<p>Biyao slowly walked onto the bank and stood beside him. Her eyes were flowing and full of laughter. Zhang Xiaofan looked at her, but saw her skin as snow and beautiful as ever. There were more crystal water drops on her face, falling down, almost like beating in the heart.</p>
<p>As soon as he was shaken, he dared not look again, turned his head and whispered, &ldquo;congratulations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biyao seemed to be stunned for a while, but looking at his eyes, there was no less smile, and his voice seemed to be a little gentle. &ldquo;You are careful,&rdquo; she said</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan somehow, his mouth was dry and his face was a little shy and hot. He took a step to the side and unconsciously left the woman a little further away, saying, &ldquo;then you don&rsquo;t want to go in and have a look?&rdquo; Looking at him, Biyao suddenly smiled and said, &ldquo;you seem to be afraid of me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan immediately shook his head like a rattle and said, &ldquo;no, no&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biyao looked at him for a long time and nodded, but there was still a smile on her face and said, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go in together!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was shocked, hesitated for a moment, and said: &ldquo;no, no, it&rsquo;s not good. This is the place of your demon sect, or you&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo; &ldquo;Then if there is a way out, wouldn&rsquo;t you go in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan stayed for a while, grabbed his head, and said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s it, too. Let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biyao smiled, nodded, stepped into the water again, walked through the water curtain and into the cave. Zhang Xiaofan hesitated for a moment, and finally followed up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a deep tunnel. The things on the stone wall on the side of the tunnel are obviously less than those on the outer channel. Although the road can be barely seen, it&rsquo;s very dark.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan and Biyao are very careful. After all, this is the first time that someone has come here in 800 years. No one knows whether the old monsters of the blood refining hall in those years will leave some particularly powerful prohibitions.</p>
<p>On the way, it was peaceful and no accident happened, but the passage was quite zigzag, deep and long, and slowly upward. Zhang Xiaofan thought roughly that he was afraid that he and Biyao had arrived at the center of the mountain at the moment.</p>
<p>He is thinking, walking in front of the green Yao suddenly stopped, low voice way: &ldquo;to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s heart leaped. Looking forward, he saw that at the end of the tunnel in front of him, a bright light shone on him. There was a large stone chamber. Two people look at each other, and Biyao takes the first step and goes there.</p>
<p>Gradually approaching, the two also saw the situation of the stone chamber. The whole stone chamber was in a circular shape. The tunnel was in the middle of the stone chamber, and there was a passage extending inward on the opposite side. It seemed that this was not the only end.</p>
<p>On the left side of the stone room, there are two huge stone sculptures, one is kind-hearted, standing with a smile, the other is carved with clothes as lifelike as the wind, which is a bit like the avalokitesvara of Buddhism.</p>
<p>The other one is totally different. It&rsquo;s ferocious and ferocious. It&rsquo;s black face ghost angle, eight hands and four heads. Even a trace of blood is engraved on the mouth, which makes people shiver.</p>
<p>In addition, in front of the two statues, there is a stone table with a censer on the top and several packages of incense candles on the side. They are all covered with dust. It is estimated that there has never been incense in the past 800 years.</p>
<p>As for the other end of the stone chamber, there were only a few dandelions, which were thrown on the ground at will. There was nothing else.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan saw in his eyes that he was surprised, but saw the solemn face of Baguio. He went to pick up a dandruff, shook off the dust, and put it in front of the stone table. Then he picked up the candle on the table, lit it with the flint in his arms, inserted it into the censer, and went back to the dandruff, kneeling down in awe.</p>
<p>In the stone room, she was crawling on the ground when she saw the light smoke slowly rising.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan stood behind her and heard her voice echoing in the stone room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The virgin of Youming, the emperor of Tiansha and the forty third generation disciple of the holy religion, Biyao, sincerely paid a visit.
