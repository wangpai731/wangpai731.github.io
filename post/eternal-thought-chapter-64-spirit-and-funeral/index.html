      <p>&ldquo;Spread out and try our best to find Bai Xiaochun. If I find someone, I will reward him for his contribution. If you see any other members of the Luochen family outside, kill them all!&rdquo; Ouyang Jie took back his eyes and looked at Li Qinghou&rsquo;s back. When he opened his mouth slowly, all the disciples around him immediately spread.</p>
<p>Over 2000 people have been searching for it for a month.</p>
<p>In the past month, nearly all the people in the Wanli area were searched. Unfortunately, no one found Bai Xiaochun. However, along the way, the bodies of those Luochen family members killed by Bai Xiaochun were shocked by the discovery of one of them.</p>
<p>Most of the members of the Luochen family were killed by one blow, which made it hard for everyone to imagine how a disciple of the sixth floor of condensate gas could do it.</p>
<p>Qian Dajin inhaled again and again. He suddenly felt that Bai Xiaochun had better die. Otherwise, he was so fierce that he might not be his opponent. Moreover, he saw Li Qinghou&rsquo;s anger, and he felt extremely uneasy in his heart and complained secretly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn it, you have such a background. You said it earlier. If you want to say it, I won&rsquo;t provoke you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Especially in the nameless mountains and jungles, they saw the bodies of three people who had fallen to the eighth floor of condensate gas. Looking at the tragedy there, they had pictures in their minds, and everyone was shocked.</p>
<p>After searching for a month, we gradually understood that Bai Xiaochun It should be dead. The place of death is this nameless mountain jungle. There are many fierce animals here. There are too many ways to make a person unable to find his body after he dies.</p>
<p>Especially after they learned from the two Luochen family members who were sent by Chen Heng before, it is very likely that the one who pursued Bai Xiaochun was the major master of Luochen who was trained as the ninth layer of condensate gas. They realized that Bai Xiaochun Really dead.</p>
<p>A month later, they finished the search and returned to zongmen. Hou Yunfei was found. Although he was seriously injured, he was cured with zongmen&rsquo;s full strength, which was not a big problem.</p>
<p>He and Du Lingfei have made great contributions to the family, but their hearts are not a bit excited, some are just sad, just memories.</p>
<p>Both of them didn&rsquo;t want to go back, but they were seriously injured and were taken back to zongmen. Li Qinghou stayed behind. He searched for another two months in this nameless mountain jungle alone. Except for some areas that he could not enter, he almost walked the mountain range. However, he still could not find Bai Xiaochun, who was clearly in the jungle, as if Bai Xiaochun and this jungle seem to be together, but they are two worlds.</p>
<p>Even in order to search for it, he was still fighting with many fierce beasts in the mountains and jungles, and he was injured himself. Two months later, he looked bitterly at a big tree with dry blood and a corner of clothes on it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I didn&rsquo;t take you up the mountain&hellip;&rdquo; Li Qinghou closed his eyes and thought of Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s fear of death in the thunder on Maoer Mountain. He recalled the scene when he was holding each other and walking in the valley of ten thousand snakes. He also recalled the scene of Xiaobi, the first of the ten stone tablets.</p>
<p>In silence, he sighed, the whole person seems to be a little older, put away that piece of clothes, this way, he has found seven or eight pieces of clothes stained with blood.</p>
<p>Finally, Li Qinghou quietly walked out of the jungle, turned into a rainbow, and flew to the distance.</p>
<p>The rebellion of the Luochen family ended. The Lingxi clan directly exterminated the rebels by means of thunder. This caused a sensation in all directions. It made the lower reaches of Tongtianhe River and occupied the Xiuzhen realm of the four continents. Countless Xiuzhen families and clans all knew that Lingxi clan, which monopolized donglinzhou and was one of the four main gates of Xiuzhen world in the lower reaches of dongmai, was even more afraid.</p>
<p>As for the reason of the Luochen family&rsquo;s rebellion, many clues have been found out under the investigation of Lingxi sect. The blood trace is only one aspect, and there are deeper reasons behind the scenes. After these clues are combined together, they involve too much, and the Lingxi clan is shocked.</p>
<p>If the Luochen family succeeds, all the Xiuzhen families within the Lingxi clan will revolt one by one. If a major enemy invades at this time, it will cause irreversible serious consequences and even shake the clan.</p>
<p>At this moment, the credit of Du Lingfei and Du Lingfei is very important, especially for Bai Xiaochun. If he did not sacrifice his life for justice, it would be very difficult for the news to be sent back in time.</p>
<p>Especially in this incident, Bai Xiaochun didn&rsquo;t leave the same school alone. In order to save the same sect and lead away the enemy, it moved everyone. There were many selfish people in the cultivation world. There were very few people like Bai Xiaochun. Such a disciple fell down, which made all the sect leaders including the leader feel sorry.</p>
<p>There was too much behind this incident. As more clues were found out, the Lingxi sect was silent. For some reason, they did not continue to pursue. However, the foundation building monks in the whole clan were on guard one by one.</p>
<p>As if The rain is coming.</p>
<p>After several days of communication and research, they reached an agreement.</p>
<p>Du Lingfei, Hou Yunfei and Feng Yan, especially Bai Xiaochun He made a great contribution this time!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before the rain comes, we need more There is a spiritual existence, which is the same spirit of our Lingxi sect for thousands of years. Bai Xiaochun has made such great contributions with his life. We should hold a funeral for him. We will never forget those who have made contributions to the sect! &quot; This is the lingxizong leader Zheng Yuandong, finally said a word.</p>
<p>In the days after that, although lingxizong didn&rsquo;t investigate the reasons behind the rebellion of the Luochen family, they took advantage of this opportunity to vigorously promote Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s feat of sacrificing his life for the same family and taking justice for the clan.</p>
<p>His deeds were spread to all the disciples of the mountains on both sides of the north and south sides of the mountain. They all knew everything Bai Xiaochun had done to save his classmates.</p>
<p>At the same time, the zongmen would never let such kind of loving and righteous disciples feel cold. It is clear that a family that Li Qinghou could be exterminated, but the clan sent out more than 2000 inner disciples on the south bank, making a great deal of noise and killing chickens with ox knives.</p>
<p>All the disciples in the sect remembered the name of Bai Xiaochun, but they were also very moved. Even though there was a deliberate practice of the clan, they were very moved This kind of deliberate, every disciple is eager to exist.</p>
<p>The tradition of Lingxi is unchanging!</p>
<p>Those who move my disciples will be punished at all costs!</p>
<p>Any disciple of Lingxi sect is not alone when he goes out. As long as Lingxi sect is there, the clan behind him is the permanent backing.</p>
<p>And this will turn into a stronger sense of identity, so that all disciples are willing to pay everything for the sect, including their own lives, to defend the sect and their homeland.</p>
<p>This is Lingxi sect Ten thousand years ago, there were only a few dozens of people living in the small gate.</p>
<p>As for Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s life and death, even the leader came forward and asked one of the sect&rsquo;s elders, who was good at deducing the secrets of heaven, to cast the Dharma in person. Unfortunately, he could not find the trace of Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s existence in the world. Only by perceiving the air of death could Bai Xiaochun be determined He died for zongmen.</p>
<p>A few days later, in the early morning, the sky was overcast and rainy, and the sound of a bell with sadness reverberated in the whole Lingxi sect. Countless disciples, dressed in black robes, walked out of their homes in silence, looking sad, and gradually converged on the hillside of Xiangyun mountain.</p>
<p>There, there is a tombstone with a portrait of Bai Xiaochun, in which he is very happy.</p>
<p>Zhang daphou stood in the crowd, looking at the crowd, and looking at the name of Bai Xiaochun written on the tombstone. The rain fell on him and wet his clothes. He cried. He remembered the scene with Bai Xiaochun. He thought of eating spirit beads together, laughing loudly together, going to sell places outside and stealing chickens together</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jiupang&hellip;&rdquo; Zhang daphou looked sad, and his heart was empty. He felt sad, as if the whole world was dark.</p>
<p>The other fat elder martial brothers of huozaofang, as well as Heisan Pang, were also in the crowd, one by one sad and sorrowful, with more than tears.</p>
<p>There are also Xu Baocai, Chen Ziang, Zhao Yiduo, elder Xu and Zhou Changlao. All the people who knew him from Bai Xiaochun were in the crowd, looking sad.</p>
<p>Zhou Xinqi also came. She looked at the tombstone silently. When she heard about Bai Xiaochun, her first thought was Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s enthusiasm for looking for Lingwei chicken.</p>
<p>Hou Yunfei was supported by Hou Xiaomei and stood in the crowd. His fist was holding tightly. His body was shaking and his face was sad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Younger martial brother Bai&hellip;&rdquo; Hou Yunfei laughs bitterly. After he returns to the ancestral gate, he drinks to spend his days. He can&rsquo;t forget the figure when Bai Xiaochun leads away the strong enemy.</p>
<p>In the past four weeks, there were more and more people. Soon, there were countless disciples on the hillside of Xiangyun mountain. Everyone was silent and looked at the tombstone.</p>
<p>Du Lingfei was in front of her, pale, and the rain fell on her face. She could not tell whether it was rain or tears. Her face was even in a trance. Her beautiful face was now more beautiful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can live I&rsquo;m alive, you&rsquo;re gone&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>Du Lingfei is sad and sorrowful. During this period of time, her whole person is haggard. Every time she dreams, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s figure will appear. The return of iron and blood, the turning away, this scene makes Du Lingfei&rsquo;s heart cut like a knife and tears more.</p>
<p>The mournful bell has been ringing all the time, and has not been dispersed for a long time. In the reverberation of the bell, there are many Changhong coming slowly from the distance. The palms of seven mountain peaks, all the elders of lingxizong and the headmaster, wearing black robes, all appear under the tombstone, looking at the tombstone one by one and mourning with divine color.</p>
<p>Li Qinghou&rsquo;s heart was bitter and bitter, and he was deeply reproached.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bai Xiaochun, a disciple of Xiangyun mountain in Lingxi, is a disciple of Yaodao Jiaoyang and a Taoist disciple Tianjiao. In the first battle of the Luochen family, he killed many Luochen rebels, sacrificed himself for his fellow disciples and took justice for the clan. He made great contributions to the sect with his life. All the disciples of Lingxi sect should bear this in mind forever!&rdquo; The leader opened his mouth slowly, and his voice spread all over the place at this moment.</p>
<p>His voice was sad. When it came out, Du Lingfei&rsquo;s cry could not be controlled, and there were more tears. Hou Yunfei and Zhang daphou, countless people shed tears at this moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Today, I specially pursue Bai Xiaochun as my disciple of Zong Yaorong in Lingxi!&rdquo; When the leader&rsquo;s voice echoed again, the hearts of countless disciples around him were shocked. The four words of Yaorong disciple shook everyone.</p>
<p>Glorious disciple is the supreme honor of the whole Lingxi sect. It is a special title listed separately. Its status is higher than that of the inner gate and is equal to the inheritance sequence. Among the dead, the glory is the highest, and among the living, the inheritance is the strongest.</p>
<p>Before that, there were nine people who won the title of honorary disciple in Lingxi sect over the past ten thousand years. Each of them was awarded the title of honorary disciple after he made great contributions to the sect. Now, there is the tenth one.</p>
<p>No one thinks this is inappropriate. All this is the exchange of Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bai Xiaochun has no master since he entered the sect until he died. We will never allow him to be alone in the shade. Today, I will take Bai Xiaochun as a disciple instead of his deceased master, immortal Lingluo, so that he can continue to pursue the road in Yin Ming.&rdquo; When the headmaster opened his mouth painfully, Li Qinghou nodded gently and looked at the tombstone. His eyes showed sadness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everyone Silence The headmaster closed his eyes and lowered his head slowly towards the tombstone. All the disciples around him bowed their heads at this moment.</p>
<p>After a few breaths, when the silence was over, Du Lingfei was in tears.</p>
<p>While everyone was silent, Bai Xiaochun opened her eyes and sneezed in the jungle of the nameless mountains.</p>
<p>=======</p>
<p>Today, I would like to recommend a mysterious organization &ldquo;Yangcun&rdquo;, which is committed to promoting high-quality books, integrating the resources of book friends, everbright.com, and seeking the welfare of book friends. Moreover, it has a strong strength and a huge background. Every villager is quite mysterious The hundred League on the day of Er Gen&rsquo;s opening book was initiated by Yangcun.</p>
<p>The head of Yangcun village is a big league, and the ash has fallen. Now I hear that he is recruiting new people into the village. The group number is 599199. He has a rare opportunity and a lot of welfare. He should enter the village quickly~~</p>
