      <p>The catastrophe started in spring and summer of that year. Thousands of years later, people in the world still remember clearly that period of horrible and crazy days.</p>
<p>In the extreme south of Southern Xinjiang, among the 100000 mountains, countless monsters suddenly swarmed out. They were bloodthirsty, and they killed people whenever they saw people. There were also many evil beasts who were greedy for human flesh, and the places they passed were appalling.</p>
<p>The catastrophe broke out in southern Xinjiang, which was close to 100000 mountains, and quickly spread to the whole southern Xinjiang. Miao, Zhuang, Tu, Li and Gaoshan of the five ethnic groups in southern Xinjiang rose to resist.</p>
<p>However, in the face of numerous alien monsters, especially in the numerous ferocious ones, there are more than a dozen strange monsters with extremely strong Demon power and witchcraft skills. The resistance of the five clans is no different from that of a mantis. In a blink of an eye, they are defeated, and the lives of the southern Xinjiang people are in ruins.</p>
<p>The incident immediately shocked the world and spread all over the world. The Chinese people in the Middle Kingdom were in constant panic every day. Some of them, who were close to southern Xinjiang, fled to the north with their families and families. They only hoped that they could be as far away from the catastrophe as possible.</p>
<p>All the monks in the world were shocked. Even Zhengmo Er Dao, who had always been fighting openly and secretly, stopped to watch the South and began to figure out his own countermeasures.</p>
<p>The incense burning Valley, located in the southern orthodox school, was lucky to escape because the valley master Yun Yilan happened to lead most of his disciples to visit daoxuan immortal in Qingyun Mountain.</p>
<p>After the incident, the leader of Yunyi Lan Valley, who was in Qingyun Mountain, heard about the miserable situation of the people in southern Xinjiang. He felt very sad and said that if he was there, he would never allow evil spirits to do evil to the people. The words are very sad and self reproachful. He has already committed suicide to thank the whole world. Fortunately, the left and right disciples held on and the elders of Qingyun gate offered their best advice. Then the cloud Valley master calmed down and vowed to do his best to burn the whole valley of incense Valley and avenge this deep blood feud for the people of Southern Xinjiang!</p>
<p>Not long ago, Yun Yilan announced to the people who were practicing Taoism in Qingyun Mountain, indicating that today&rsquo;s catastrophe was actually caused by an animal demon, and the demon&rsquo;s skill is high. Because of its ferocious nature, it cannot be resisted by the common attack of the whole world. In view of this, the burning incense Valley and Qingyun gate jointly appeal to the world&rsquo;s practitioners. Take the power of the world and kill this Liao!</p>
<p>The next day, Tianyin temple, which received the news, formally responded and agreed with the call of Qingyun and incense burning, and soon sent people to join the alliance.</p>
<p>Zhengdao was eager to raise funds for discussion, and sent a number of excellent disciples to investigate the details of these monsters. After all, if you know yourself and know the enemy, you will be invincible.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the three big sects of the demon sect, guiwangzong, Wandu gate and Huanhuan sect, which are usually arrogant and arrogant, all of a sudden quiet down. They seem to be watching each other and are not in a hurry to have any action. When the wind and rain come, we will be calm.</p>
<p>On the day before the arrival of the summer solstice, this strange calm was finally broken, and the monsters who ravaged Southern Xinjiang to the point where they could not look like were finally killed in the Middle Earth.</p>
<p>However, at the beginning, the death and injury of the people were not very serious, because as early as a month ago, the people near the South had already run clean. It&rsquo;s just that the number of these monsters seems to be increasing. It spread even more rapidly, and was about to be forced into the hinterland of the Middle Earth. At that time, it was the time for all the people in the world to fall into a miserable place.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to tell whether it&rsquo;s shocking news or true or false rumors, but the shocking news is indeed coming one after another. Yesterday, it said that a village was bloodwashed, and today it is rumored that the whole city has been turned into ruins. Every day spent in fear and fear is so miserable and panic for anyone.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that for people who are dying. Even if all the people in the world are dead, it seems that it&rsquo;s none of your business. GUI Li stayed with Zhou Yixian, Xiao Huan and wild dog for more than a month. He didn&rsquo;t know why he followed them all the time. Maybe I have long felt that there is no place to go, so let it be.</p>
<p>Among the group, Monday immortal is the one who is most opposed to devilish following around. He has an extra guy to eat free food, but he can&rsquo;t carry luggage or do chores like a wild dog Taoist. He drinks or sleeps all day. On the other hand, he has to be taken care of from time to time.</p>
<p>When it comes to free food, GUI Li is just drinking a little wine. The biggest thorn in the eye of Zhouxian now is the three eyed monkey who follows GUI Li. Xiaohui not only eats a lot of food, but also drinks far more than Guili. The man who gets drunk after drinking can compare with him. If it&rsquo;s not for Xiaohuan, he insists on taking this man Monkey, Monday fairy has been running far away.</p>
<p>As for the Taoist priest of wild dog, he was stopped by Xiao Hui&rsquo;s discovery since he wanted to plot evil. In the end, he was spared by Gui Li. Since then, he has been more reticent and often doesn&rsquo;t say a word for a few days.</p>
<p>However, in the past few days, whether Zhou Yixian or Xiaohuan, including the silent Taoist priest of wild dog, have gradually found that Gui Li seems to have some changes. Although it is difficult for them to say clearly, GUI Li is gradually waking up. The most obvious manifestation is that he began to reduce when he was drunk. Sometimes he didn&rsquo;t drink all night For the same is very strange - GUI Li and Xiao Hui often sit together, facing the north direction, dazed, seems to be thinking of something.</p>
<p>The news of the catastrophe in the South gradually spread as the people who fled to the North rushed to the north. Zhou Yixian and others also knew about it.</p>
<p>After hearing the news, Monday immortal was stunned, then pondered for a long time, shook his head, and then sighed all day, saying where to escape?</p>
<p>As for other people, they are not as worried as he is. GUI Li and wild dog Taoist are all worried. Xiao Huan doesn&rsquo;t seem to take the crisis that sounds far away in his mind. For her, she plays with Xiao Hui on weekdays, and occasionally takes care of GUI Li to talk with him, which makes life very interesting.</p>
<p>However, under the insistence of Monday immortal, the group finally headed north. According to the saying of Monday immortal, the farther away from the south, at least people&rsquo;s life is easier. But with more and more refugees from the south along the way, the situation seems to be getting worse. The monsters coming out of the 100000 mountains are like a raging force. They are eating like crazy all the way, and have been gradually forced into the hinterland of the Middle Earth.</p>
<p>A few days ago, a lot of news even said that the monster alien had killed a city hundreds of miles behind them, frightening Zhouxian and Xiaohuan and others on their way. Although they soon learned that the news was a rumor, the fear of the people was obvious.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, a group of people went to sleep in the wild. In a small hill on a fire, sitting around the fire, only sitting in the distance.</p>
<p>Xiaohui jumped out of the dark, holding a lot of wild fruits in his hands. I don&rsquo;t know where it was picked. I jumped on my shoulder two or three times. After I sat down, I ate a lot.</p>
<p>Zhou Yixian looked over there and pondered for a while. Looked at the side of the small ring and wild dog Taoist, said: &ldquo;I have a thing to tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan was a little strange. He took a look at Zhouxian and said, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter, grandfather?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Monday fairy just want to open his mouth, suddenly sat on the shoulder of the small ash seems to find something, loud &ldquo;squeak&rdquo; to call.</p>
<p>All of them were surprised. They all stood up. Go to the small ash behind, follow its hand and foot dance direction to see. In the dim light, on the ancient road under the hill, a group of people, men, women, old and young, all looked tired, but they still waddled forward.</p>
<p>Monday fairy looked for a long time, sighed and said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a refugee from the south.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All were silent, and no one spoke. Monday immortal was silent for a moment and said, &ldquo;actually, this is what I want to say. At present, I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going on there in the south, but suddenly many monsters and barbarians will kill people when they see people. This can&rsquo;t be wrong. In recent days, we have seen many people flee to the north. I think we should speed up our journey and go north. &quot;</p>
<p>Xiao Huan frowned and said, &ldquo;grandfather, it&rsquo;s right to go north. Anyway, we&rsquo;ve been wandering around. But the north is so big. I heard that the monsters move very fast. Do you have a good place to hide? &quot;</p>
<p>Monday fairy glared at her and said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you listen to the rumors in these days? Some of those monsters have good noses and good hearing. No matter you hide in the tree, hide in the cellar, or even run into the mountains, you will be found and eaten. Where can I find a place to hide when I encounter such a monstrous monster? &quot;</p>
<p>Small ring face a bitter, way: &ldquo;how do we do, sooner or later will be eaten by those monsters?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Monday, the immortal snorted and said, &ldquo;nonsense, how can I die in the mouth of these animals. I&rsquo;ve already calculated that there is only one place in the world that is the safest. &quot;</p>
<p>Xiao Huan was surprised. The wild dog Taoist priest and his fierce body moved. He looked at the immortal Monday, and he was proud of himself. He laughed twice. Xiaohuan was surprised and pleased, and said, &ldquo;grandfather, there is such a place, say it quickly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Monday fairy coughed twice, and then solemnly said, &ldquo;Qingyun Mountain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as the Taoist priest&rsquo;s face changed, he turned his head. Only Xiaohuan was surprised and said, &ldquo;I know that Qingyun Mountain is the place of Qingyun gate. There are many practitioners of Taoism, but after all, it&rsquo;s just a school of strength. If you meet those monsters, you can protect yourself. Where can you care about us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Monday, the immortal laughed and said, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t know. Although I haven&rsquo;t heard from you yet, I&rsquo;m sure that the fire incense Valley and Tianyin Temple sects must join forces in Qingyun, because the old man Yun Yilan is in Qingyun now. In addition, in the battle of Qingyun ten years ago, the&rdquo; immortal killing sword array &ldquo;of Qingyun gate</p>
<p>The ghost Li hears these four words in the side, the body fierce a shake.</p>
<p>Zhou Yixian didn&rsquo;t pay attention to him, and continued to say happily: &ldquo;the sword array of killing immortals in Qingyun gate is in the limelight. Everyone knows that the sword array has earth shaking magic power. So if you join the alliance in Qingyun, it will be safer at least. In my opinion, most of the righteous people in the world will go to Qingyun in a few days to fight against this unprecedented calamity. If we get to Qingyun, we will be in the safest place. There are so many masters of Taoism, they will not watch our common people die The more he thought about it, the more proud he was, and he couldn&rsquo;t help laughing.</p>
<p>A cold hum, but suddenly burst out in his laughter. Monday immortal was stunned and looked with Xiao Huan and wild dog Taoist. He saw the ghost slowly standing up from the shadow, but didn&rsquo;t turn around. He said coldly: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that those noble men of the right will not only see you dead, but also kick you in the back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhou Yixian was ridiculed by him in front of his face. He could not hold his face. He said angrily, &ldquo;bah, you are a devious devil and evil way anyway. If you go there, you will be expelled&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grandfather!&rdquo; cried Xiao Huan</p>
<p>Monday fairy looked at the small ring, know that the words are heavy, angry stop, small ring turned to the ghost, some hesitation, but finally said: &ldquo;you, you don&rsquo;t listen to my grandfather. That&rsquo;s what he said&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You dare to say that your grandfather&rsquo;s mouth is open!&rdquo; he said</p>
<p>Xiaohuan ignored him, or said to the ghost: &ldquo;but now the situation is really bad, you&rsquo;d better go with us. After all, it will be safer than other places&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t wait for the small ring to finish saying, ghost sharp light way: &ldquo;no, the world is big, I own where to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he moved forward.</p>
<p>Xiaohuan is surprised.</p>
<p>An anxious look appeared on his face and said, &ldquo;Zhang You, where are you going</p>
<p>GUI Li didn&rsquo;t answer. The figure moved forward from slow to fast. The little ash lying on his shoulder turned his head and looked at the small ring standing on the hill, grinning and shaking.</p>
<p>Small ring looked at that quickly small disappeared figure, also do not know for what, suddenly for no reason to feel the heart suddenly empty. If your nose is sour, you will almost shed tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hiss!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sound of breaking the sky is light, and the ghost&rsquo;s sharp body shadow cuts through the sky at night. It seems that even the sky was affected by the southern catastrophe, which made it dark and gave no hope.</p>
<p>After leaving Zhou Yixian and others, GUI Li flew south alone for a period of time, only in the night sky, under the dark clouds. But it was dark and dark in all directions. Under the curtain of the sky, the mountains were desolate, and people were empty in the air. I don&rsquo;t know where to go.</p>
<p>Lying on the shoulder of the small ash, suddenly called twice, ghost Li looked at it, saw three eyes in front of him, small ash grinned, for it. It seems that most of the time is happy. GUI Li&rsquo;s rare face showed a trace of smile and love, gently touched the monkey&rsquo;s head, and his body sank to the ground.</p>
<p>The foothold is a wild mountain with dense forests. Looking at the luxuriant vegetation and dense shrubs, there is no place for people to step down in the forest. I think nobody has ever been to this mountain and forest since I want to be in the wilderness. He was pale and fell in the forest. His right hand trembled. The magic wand flew out of his sleeve and circled around under his feet. He did not hear any strange noise. In a flash, all the trees, shrubs and brambles in the six foot circle suddenly withered and turned into dead branches.</p>
<p>And as the soul swallowing flies back to the hand, the ghost sharp clearly feels a wisp of thin cold breath swimming in the black stick body. Xiao Hui gave a joyful cry, jumped down from his shoulder and ran to the depth of the forest. GUI Li looked up at Xiao Hui&rsquo;s back. After a trip to southern Xinjiang, especially after Xiaohui&rsquo;s transformation, his food consumption began to increase rapidly, always thinking about eating.</p>
<p>The night was deep, and the night wind was blowing from the fields, and the trees were making waves, and countless shadows were shaking together. GUI Li slowly sat down on the ground and closed his eyes slowly. The shadows of the trees around him swept over his face. In the dark, he was like a silent ghost.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how long later, there was a faint low roar in the distance, and then disappeared. He frowned slightly and opened his eyes, but his body did not move. As expected, after a while, there was a shaking in the nearby bushes, but it was the monkey ash who came back.</p>
<p>For Xiao Hui, the sharp and annoying thorns seem not to be put in his eyes at all. Most of the time, he stepped on the past directly and ran close to him. He saw that Xiao Hui had one hand on his chest. He was holding several wild fruits, but his other hand was dragging behind him, as if pulling something.</p>
<p>GUI Li couldn&rsquo;t help being a little strange. He took a look behind him and was surprised. In the shadow, Xiaohui ran back with an animal like object. It was not small. It was much bigger than Xiaohui, but it was very easy for Xiaohui to drag. A moment later, Xiaohui has already run to the nearest place. With a smile, he puts down the wild fruit first, then waves his hand, &ldquo;bang&rdquo;</p>
<p>A heavy object fell in front of me.</p>
<p>It was an adult wild boar. It was very big. I was afraid to stand up higher than Xiaohui. But now I saw a hole in the boar&rsquo;s head, bleeding and dead. GUI Li looked at the wound and saw that the wound was still new. He was stunned and said to Xiao Hui, &ldquo;did you catch it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Hui grinned and pointed to the wild boar and the ghost.</p>
<p>Ghost Li sighed and said with a smile, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not hungry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohui grabs his head, three eyes blink together, then points to the boar, and points to himself. GUI Li was amused by it. He couldn&rsquo;t help laughing. He felt a lot of heavy feelings in his heart for a moment. He said with a smile, &ldquo;OK, I&rsquo;ll help you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Hui is very happy. Obviously, I know that Gui Li&rsquo;s craftsmanship is very important, which is my favorite. GUI Li rolled up his sleeve and pointed like a knife, gently scratched on the boar&rsquo;s belly. At that time, he scratched the tough pigskin and saw that he was skillful. He peeled and boned the wild boar two or three times, and then flew to find a place with spring water to wash the pork back and set up a wooden frame to make a fire. It&rsquo;s time to roast the pig.</p>
<p>As the fire grew stronger, Xiao Hui and his fierce face were flushed by the fire. Xiao Hui had already eaten several wild fruits, and now his eyes were staring at the roast pig, which was gradually emitting fragrance from the flame. GUI Li slowly took out all kinds of self-made seasonings from his waist, added a little bit to the meat, and then found a small bottle of sesame oil and began to sprinkle it gently on the pork. Sesame oil along the pork flow slowly, by the bottom of the flame roast, slowly into the meat.</p>
<p>Soon, the surface of the pork began to turn pale golden yellow, and the pork itself exuded transparent oil droplets. The alluring fragrance drifted away.</p>
<p>The light of the fire lit up the faces of monkeys and people, as well as the small open space trees around. The reflection of the tall trees swayed as if the wind were blowing. The ghost looked at the burning flame in front of him, and he gradually lost his mind, while Xiao Hui looked at the roast pig with salivation. He touched his ears and caught his cheek. From time to time, he ran to the side and folded some wood branches to join the fire.</p>
<p>The quiet air is filled with strange and attractive fragrance.</p>
<p>Deep in the woods, suddenly came a low roar: &ldquo;roar!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The roar was deep and powerful. It seemed to be far away, but it still passed clearly, and a sense of killing spread quickly. The ghost suddenly woke up from his meditation and frowned slowly. The body did not move, but the eyes gradually deepened, looking at the direction of the roar. Small ash is whizzing up on the ghost sharp shoulder, the face also has no fear look, the same look back.</p>
<p>There was a crack in the fire, and a branch burst out. The smell of wild boar is stronger.</p>
<p>Three feet away, there is a dark forest. The wind in the forest seems to be suddenly strong and loud. After that low roar, there is no sound. However, the cold and frightful meaning almost comes to here quickly with tangible quality.</p>
<p>The pupils in the fierce eyes contracted slightly, and the brows wrinkled more tightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crack!&rdquo; Another twig finally burst away.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, the whistling wind lost its voice, and the whole forest seemed to be still for a moment, and there was no sound any more. In the front of the dark, the thick woods and tangled thorns suddenly fell to both sides, showing a narrow passage for one to walk.</p>
<p>A young man in a bright silk dress, with a handsome face and almost a touch of enchantment, stepped out of the darkness step by step. In the night, he was so conspicuous that it seemed that he was shining around him. GUI Li didn&rsquo;t get up and didn&rsquo;t move. He still sat on the ground and looked directly at the young man.</p>
<p>The young man looked at GUI Li, and then his eyes fell on Xiao Hui&rsquo;s body, slightly stunned, &ldquo;eh&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three eyed monkey!&rdquo; he said</p>
<p>GUI Li didn&rsquo;t speak, but Xiao Hui suddenly &ldquo;squeaked&rdquo; and called out, very angry.</p>
<p>Almost at the same time of Xiao Hui&rsquo;s shouting, the low roar just now rang again. The difference is that this time, the roar is directly from the back of the youth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roar&hellip;&rdquo; With this deep and powerful roar, a ferocious head, four eyes, two pairs of faces, thick as a copper bell, rose slowly from the shoulder of the young man. The mouth is very large, almost as wide as the face. Between the mouths, you can see that the mouth is full of sharp teeth, especially the six sharp fangs that extend out of the mouth. Under the dim light of the fire in the field, it is faintly visible that saliva drips from between the teeth and falls on the gray black skin full of hard pimples of the monster.</p>
<p>GUI Li&rsquo;s face finally changed. He stood up slowly and said coldly, &ldquo;Taotie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man did not answer, and his eyes were still on his body. Suddenly, he seemed to have a sense of it. He turned to Taotie. He was stunned. He saw that the fierce eyes of this evil beast had been added to his greed. However, the target was not fierce and small ash, but the wild boar was roasting on the ground.</p>
<p>There was a delicious smell of barbecue in the air.</p>
<p>The young man suddenly laughed and said to the ghost: &ldquo;your skill is good! I said why I was so restless tonight that I was attracted by you. &quot;</p>
<p>Guili light way: &ldquo;although Taotie is ancient evil beast, fierce and fast, but always greedy, a roast pig is nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man shook his head and said, &ldquo;otherwise, my gluttonous food is different. The ordinary food has long been neglected. I can&rsquo;t believe that you are greedy for this seemingly rough barbecue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the moment, as the young man said, Taotie seemed to have a special preference for the roast pig. The saliva between his mouth and teeth ran down his teeth. Suddenly, with a roar, Taotie jumped out of the boy&rsquo;s shoulder and turned into a shadow and rushed to the fire. Unexpectedly, the gray shadow flashed, and the sound of &ldquo;squeak&rdquo; sounded angrily. It turned out that the small ash came out in front of the roast pig.</p>
<p>With a low roar, Taotie fell to the ground and showed his real body. His body was at least four times larger than that of the wild boar. The strangest thing about it was that its neck was extremely long, and it almost doubled the height of its body.</p>
<p>Compared with Xiaohui, Xiaohui is pitifully small, but for some reason, Taotie seems to be afraid of Xiaohui and dare not be careless. He just can&rsquo;t give up the food in front of him. He growls in his mouth and his expression gradually becomes ferocious.</p>
<p>He looked at the two foreign animals who were angry at each other in order to roast the pig. Suddenly, he said, &ldquo;the wild boar has not been roasted, and the taste is not hot. What are you arguing about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said this inexplicably, and even the young boy couldn&rsquo;t help looking at him more. But the two opposing animals reacted. Taotie&rsquo;s four eyes were staring at Xiaohui, and Xiaohui was still wide open with three eyes. The seven eyes of the two strange animals were bigger than the other. After a moment, Xiaohui called at Taotie and showed his teeth. Then he ran back a few steps and a butt Sitting next to the ghost and staring at the roast pig.</p>
<p>Taotie&rsquo;s four eyes swayed with Xiaohui&rsquo;s movements. When Xiaohui sat down, the evil beast &ldquo;roared and roared&rdquo; twice. Unexpectedly, he slowly walked to the other end of the flame. His hind legs were folded up and his front legs swung slightly. He even lay down in front of the fire. But the saliva in his mouth still flowed out involuntarily. It was horrible, but still funny.</p>
<p>Looking at Taotie&rsquo;s sitting down, the young man slowly came over, and did not care about the dirt on the ground. He sat down beside him, looked at the ghost, and said with a smile, &ldquo;who is your master? I can&rsquo;t believe that there is such a means that Taotie can temporarily suppress his ferocity?&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li didn&rsquo;t look at him. He sat down, his eyes fluttering, and he went back to the fire. He said, &ldquo;you and I happened to meet in the mountains. Why do you know the name? It&rsquo;s just a roast pig. It&rsquo;s just a belly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man looked at the ghost for a while, and then he burst into laughter. The laughter was loud and clear, and aroused countless night birds in the distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well said, well said.&rdquo; He hit his leg gently, and his face was surprised with admiration. He said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s just a good one. Speaking of all living beings in the world, busy all day long, is not it just for the sake of food. In this way, don&rsquo;t you say &ldquo;man&rdquo; is no different from me, a gluttonous beast</p>
<p>GUI Li flipped the roast pig gently, and the flavor of sesame oil on the pork suddenly became strong, which attracted the opposite gluttonous food. But I don&rsquo;t know whether it is for tasting the delicious food or something. This strange beast, which is also known as greedy in addition to ferocity, tolerated it, and Xiao Hui glared at it.</p>
<p>The flame was still burning, reflecting on his fierce face. He said slowly, &ldquo;people are different.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; said the young man</p>
<p>GUI Li said: &ldquo;love and hate, people have feelings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man laughed and said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you know that the animals also have feelings. If you kill this wild boar, you should know that the boar is in pain and fear. If I kill you, you are also like a pig.</p>
<p>All living beings are equal. How can we distinguish between man and beast? &quot;</p>
<p>GUI Li raised his eyes, looked at the youth, and said, &ldquo;there are differences.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man&rsquo;s eyes were sharp and said, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the difference?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a great regret in my life. I engraved it in my heart day and night. Life is not like death, but I can&rsquo;t live without life. To live is to have expectation, and to die to be a coward. How can pigs have such love and hatred? &quot;</p>
<p>Young one Zheng, in the eye sharp color gradually fades, immediately on the face appears is the unusual look.</p>
<p>Note 1: Taotie: the gods, demons and aspirations are different. Strange animals: in the south of Shenzhou, there are evil beasts with four eyes, black skin, long neck and four feet. They are ferocious and greedy. If the wind is fast, it is a disaster. (to be continued. )</p>
