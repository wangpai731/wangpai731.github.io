      <p>Ghost calendar is silent, the house is silent.</p>
<p>After a moment, master Pu Hong said slowly, &ldquo;younger martial brother, you all know the cause and effect of this matter. I don&rsquo;t need to say more. Today, this ghost calendar benefactor came here to borrow a treasure from Tianyin temple to save people. &quot;</p>
<p>Master Pude is still looking at the ghost calendar. His eyes have gradually softened from his initial shock and amazement. Obviously, master Pude also has an extraordinary feeling for the ghost calendar, just like master Pu Hong and others. After hearing master Pu Hong&rsquo;s words, master Pude&rsquo;s spirit remained unchanged and said hoarsely: &ldquo;what treasure is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Speaking of this moment, although the grandmaster&rsquo;s magnificence is still a little pause, it can be roughly coherent.</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong took a look at the ghost calendar, sighed and said: &ldquo;he wants to borrow the earth is the heaven and earth samsara plate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Pude was stunned, and his face changed slightly. Obviously, he was surprised.</p>
<p>Ghost calendar took a step forward and earnestly said: &ldquo;the soul of the friend of the two masters&rsquo; disciples has been trapped in foreign matters for ten years, which is no different from the living dead. The disciple is heartbroken every day. Although he dare not give up his hope in case of any, he pleads for mercy from the two masters. If the old wish is won, the friend of the saved disciple is willing to be a cow and a horse to repay the kindness of the two masters.!&rdquo; ;</p>
<p>Master Puhong and master Pude both chanted Buddhism together. Master Puhong said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t do this, benefactor. Kill me and wait.&rdquo;. However, after his initial surprise, master Pude has recovered his calm and frowned slightly and said, &ldquo;benefactor, where did you hear the news that heaven and earth are in our temple?&rdquo; He looks puzzled and looks at master Pu Hong.</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong gave a wry smile and said, &ldquo;younger martial brother, I have already inquired about the matter just now, but according to benefactor Guili, the elder master who told him the secret insisted on refusing to let him reveal his identity. As a senior brother, I couldn&rsquo;t make a decision for a moment. I thought that the heaven and earth samsara plate was kept by you on the spot. This is to disturb younger martial brother&rsquo;s Qingxiu. What do you mean? &quot; GUI Li then understood why master Pu Hong and FA Xiang wanted to bring him to see Master Pude. It seems that this mysterious treasure heaven and earth samsara plate is really very important. It should be kept by master Pude, one of the four holy monks, for decades. I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s really effective to cure Biyao? With this in mind, GUI Li couldn&rsquo;t help but feel a fever all over his body and clenched his hands into a fist.</p>
<p>The room was silent at the moment, and everyone&rsquo;s eyes were on the silent master Pu Hong. I saw master Pu Hong&rsquo;s eyes drooping. He seemed to be thinking about something. Looking at the expressionless face, he could not help sweating.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how long it took, master Pu Hong slowly raised his eyes, looked at GUI Li, and gently combined ten ways: &ldquo;benefactor&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li quickly returned the salute and said, &ldquo;please be merciful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Pude&rsquo;s voice was still hoarse and his tone was slow. He said, &ldquo;decades ago, Puzhi, the third younger martial brother, made a big mistake on you. I owe you a lot from Tianyin temple&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>The master Pu Hong and FA Xiang, who were nearby, heard the words of &ldquo;Amitabha&rdquo; in their mouths</p>
<p>Master Pude then said, &ldquo;and this heaven and earth samsara plate was brought back to our temple by younger martial brother Puzhi when he traveled to the northwest wilderness. So to speak, you are also a disciple of Puzhi junior brother, and you should be given the skill. It&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>GUI Li was glad that master Pude&rsquo;s words were hopeful. At last, master Pude&rsquo;s face suddenly appeared puzzled. He seemed to be hesitant. Suddenly, he flashed over the green figure of Biyao, who was lying quietly in the ice stone room of Huqi mountain. His body was shaking slightly, his blood was surging up, and he took two steps forward with one bite of his teeth. Come to master Pude.</p>
<p>Both master Pu Hong and FA Xiang were surprised. Master Pude was also surprised. He raised his eyes to the ghost calendar, but only saw that the ghost calendar was not disrespectful. Instead, he knelt down in front of master Pude.</p>
<p>Bang Dong!</p>
<p>The low muffled sound reverberated from the stone slabs on the ground. Ghost Li&rsquo;s forehead was buckled down in front of master Pude. Looking from the side, his hands clenched tightly. His bones are pale, and his body is shaking slightly. His voice is choking. He says in a low voice: &ldquo;master, I have a lot of sins. If I can&rsquo;t save her, I, I, I Please be merciful, please be merciful&hellip; &quot; Speaking of the latter, he seems to have been unable to control himself, just a voice of pleading.</p>
<p>The Dharma phase standing on one side could not help but be moved, and the color of unbearable flashed on his face.</p>
<p>Master Pude was stunned for a moment. He turned his head and looked at master Puhong. He didn&rsquo;t say anything. After a long time, he nodded.</p>
<p>Master Pude slowly turned his head and looked at the young man who was still crawling in front of him. After half a sound, he said softly, &ldquo;get up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li is still kneeling on the ground, motionless.</p>
<p>The corner of master Pude&rsquo;s mouth moved for a moment, and he seemed to show a faint smile. He did not know what he thought of. He said slowly: &ldquo;you are a very different temperament from the old Puzhi junior brother&hellip;&rdquo; The expression on his face, for a moment, seemed to flash a faint sadness, and then whispered: &ldquo;get up, I promise you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His body trembled, and his inner ecstasy was hard to restrain, and he suddenly raised his head.</p>
<p>Master Pude reached out and slowly took something out of his arms. His movement was very slow, and there was a pause from time to time.</p>
<p>When I looked at it, I saw that master Pude took out a round object wrapped in black cloth, which was half a foot square. However, it was not clear what it looked like. This treasure was actually collected by master Pude personally. I really can&rsquo;t help it.</p>
<p>The black cloth that covered his lying ability was not a dead knot. Master Pude put him on the ground in front of him and lifted his hand gently to untie the knot. But when he wanted to lift the black cloth, he seemed hesitant for a moment. Then he sighed, shook his head and lifted the black cloth.</p>
<p>A soft white light, moving from the black cloth curtain slowly sent out, more and more bright, but did not give people a slightest dazzling feeling. In the soft light, I can see the light dust fluttering gently. In this lonely and quiet house, I don&rsquo;t know where it comes from. It seems that the melodious and deep melodious songs reverberate in the invisible space.</p>
<p>Black cloth completely opened, ghost calendar finally saw the things in front of him, this magic weapon he placed in case he hoped to cure Biyao. However, at the next moment, his face suddenly showed a color of astonishment, as if he could not believe it. He looked up at master Pude with consternation. Master Pude had no expression on his face. A moment later, the ghost calendar subconsciously looked at master Puhong. However, master Puhong just sighed, folded his hands and said, &ldquo;Amitabha.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Huqishan. The hall of ghost king.</p>
<p>It can&rsquo;t be said from when, many of the disciples in the ghost King clan began to feel that their surroundings were not strong. Inexplicably, strange things, some things that never happened before. They all appear again and again in these days.</p>
<p>For example, this cave in the middle of the mountain, which has been extremely strong for hundreds of years, is surrounded by hard polar rock walls, not to mention broken. Even if people want to take a knife and poke a small hole in the wall, they will be tired and half dead, and they may not be able to succeed.</p>
<p>But these days, many grotesque cracks have appeared in many stone walls of the general Hall of the ghost King&rsquo;s land, and these cracks are still expanding.</p>
<p>Another example is that the people of the ghost King clan living in the cave in the middle of the mountain have been used to living in silence for a long time. However, they don&rsquo;t know when they will fall asleep when they go back to the knife room and lie in bed. Actually, many people will hear the terrible voice from the bottom of the stone chamber. That strange sound is like a huge magma torrent flowing under the body, which may erupt at any time and rush up to drown people. The strange sound pricked into the ear like a needle. Sheng Sheng wakes people up, but when they wake up, they seem to hear nothing.</p>
<p>These strange things have never happened before, but the most frightening thing for the disciples of ghost King sect is some strange things happened in the crowd. There are so few disciples of the ghost King sect who, obviously looking at their desires, will suddenly become crazy and lose their senses. They will attack anyone around them like wild animals, even if they are their own relatives or best friends. These crazy ghost King disciples will still use the most cruel way to kill anyone they can see, until they are killed by others who come to Wen Xun.</p>
<p>Within a short period of time, this kind of terrible thing has happened repeatedly in the ghost King clan, and people are in danger for a while. Even relatives and friends can&rsquo;t believe each other any more. No one knows what happened. The whole Huqi mountain seems to be in a dangerous and strange atmosphere.</p>
<p>At dusk, some of the disciples standing at the gate of the ghost King clan stood uneasily. Some people looked at the distance and saw the sun going down. Some people are in a trance and don&rsquo;t know what they are thinking.</p>
<p>Suddenly, someone gave a &ldquo;Ho&rdquo; and said, &ldquo;someone is coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All of them were stunned and looked up. Sure enough, there was a white shadow at the foot of Jianhu Qishan mountain in the afterglow of the setting sun. It was in the direction of the ghost king family. They did not know whether the enemy or the friend was coming. They were all nervous for a moment. The white shadow was very fast. In a twinkling of an eye, it was halfway up the mountain and close to the entrance of the Guiwang Zong hall. The disciples of the ghost King clan welcomed him up and saw the truth. All of them gave out a light hush and a sigh of relief. It turned out that Xiaobai, the guest of the ghost king and the vice patriarch Guili, was the first guest of the ghost king and vice patriarch Guili.</p>
<p>Xiaobai stopped and felt a little strange in her heart. The expression of relief on the faces of these GUI Wang Zong&rsquo;s disciples seemed quite different from those in the past. Maybe those people didn&rsquo;t feel it. However, Xiaobai, who has been practicing for thousands of years, has never seen anything. It is almost an intuitive reaction. She feels that these ghost King sect disciples seem to have something on their back It&rsquo;s like a huge stone, like a tight string, which is hard to control.</p>
<p>However, it is impossible for her to say anything as soon as she meets. Besides, all the disciples make way for the road and smile. Xiaobai nodded to them and thought, maybe it was the king of ghosts who was too strict!</p>
<p>Xiaobai took two steps toward the mountain. Suddenly he stopped and called back to one of the disciples of the ghost King sect: &ldquo;Hello!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not so good. She just screamed behind them so suddenly. Almost at the same time, all the disciples of the ghost King clan were shocked. They were all excited and jumped to the ground. What&rsquo;s more, some people even wielded Sabre magic weapons. They were all in a decisive battle of life and death.</p>
<p>Xiaobai was stunned and disappointed and said, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The disciples of the ghost King clan took a look at each other. After a while, they gradually put down their weapons and relaxed. Among them, the one called by Xiaobai gave a bitter smile and said:! &quot; What&rsquo;s the matter? &quot; ;</p>
<p>Xiaobai looked at them carefully and saw that all the disciples of the ghost King clan had dark eyes and locked eyebrows. Her face was quite tired. It seemed that she had not had a good rest for a long time. She was more puzzled and asked, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter with you? How can I get so nervous when I call out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost King sect disciple is a bitter smile. She shook her head and said, &ldquo;girl, don&rsquo;t ask me. What did you call me just now?&rdquo; ;</p>
<p>Xiaobai hesitated for a moment and said, &ldquo;is your vice patriarch in the mountains?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost King&rsquo;s disciple shook his head and said, &ldquo;the deputy leader has been out for many days and is not in the mountains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaobai frowned. &ldquo;Where did he go? Did he say when he would come back</p>
<p>The ghost King&rsquo;s disciple said, &ldquo;the vice patriarch&rsquo;s whereabouts have always been mysterious. We don&rsquo;t know where he is going, and when he will come back, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaobai stood for a moment and nodded. He thought that it was true. If GUI Li was going to go, these ordinary GUI Wang Zong disciples would not know. Then he turned around and walked in the middle of the mountain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just when she steps. How can you even hear the voice of a few people in the cave of Changyin when they are talking to each other? It&rsquo;s good that Xiaobai doesn&rsquo;t care about it. Otherwise, how will you end up? &quot;</p>
<p>Another person nearby gave a bitter smile. It seemed that he was the man called &ldquo;Lao Li&rdquo;. He only heard him say, &ldquo;why am I so nervous? If you want to be OK, how can you jump so high like a rabbit? These days are really not people&rsquo;s lives. If there is a little wind and grass, I will be scared out of my soul.</p>
<p>All the people around him sighed one after another. Actually, no one refuted Lao Li&rsquo;s words. It seemed that they all agreed with him. Then we went on. The people seemed to be so worried that they would not speak any more.</p>
<p>Xiaobai was hiding in the shadow of the corridor in the middle of the mountain. His face became more and more puzzled. However, after several times of thinking, he still couldn&rsquo;t figure out what was wrong. He had to walk forward first. She returned to huqishan this time. The most important thing of nature is to find ghosts. A few days ago, she went back to the temple of Miao people in southern Xinjiang. According to the Lich&rsquo;s prompt, she finally found the ancient witch&rsquo;s Secret engraved behind the Miao dog God&rsquo;s statue. One of them is what she has been looking for for. However, she has also found some other strange things. Up to now, she has not made up her mind whether to take these things Xi told GUI Li completely.</p>
<p>But now the ghost is not in Huqi mountain, Xiaobai naturally has no way to talk about it. Not long ago, she and GUI Li passed each other in the abandoned village outside Heyang city. If she was there, she would have a thousand years of good deeds. What happened to Gui Li might turn out to be a turn for the better. But in the dark, there is a definite number. No one can tell clearly.</p>
<p>Xiaobai thinks that the world is vast and boundless. It&rsquo;s really difficult to find GUI Li. However, there are Biyao here in Huqi mountain. Anyway, GUI Li will come back here sooner or later. Anyway, he is also hesitating on what to say to Gui Li. It&rsquo;s better to think about it while waiting for GUI Li here!</p>
<p>With this in mind, Xiaobai made up his mind and turned to the haunting residence. Her footsteps echoed in the corridor. After a long walk, Xiaobai suddenly frowned and stopped.</p>
<p>In the long corridor, there used to be places where the disciples of the ghost King clan walked around and talked and laughed. At this moment, it was empty, and she was the only figure standing alone in the corridor.</p>
<p>All the people, do not know why to hide, disappeared!</p>
<p>Xiaobai looked back at his way. The end of the corridor seemed to be covered with deep darkness, so thick that it could no longer be opened.</p>
<p>She looked at it in silence for a moment, turned and went on. The sound of her footsteps echoed in the empty corridor, as if it were several times louder than usual.</p>
<p>In this strange silence, Xiaobai slowly walked to the residence of the ghost. Somehow, although the ghost was not there, she still came here subconsciously. Just as she was about to open the door, her body suddenly froze, as if she had found something, and then slowly looked up.</p>
<p>There are seven or eight deep cracks on the hard stone wall of the stone chamber where GUI Li lives. The exposed rock is rough and the potholes are not increased. It is like being torn apart by some giant force. It is like a huge wound carved on the stone wall. I don&rsquo;t know whether it will bleed from the crack!</p>
<p>Xiaobai&rsquo;s body suddenly trembled a little, staring at those cracked eyes, pupil slightly contracted, with her thousand years of practice, she even keenly felt that there was a strange breath floating around her side and on those sharp and twisted cracks.</p>
<p>The breath disgusted her subconsciously!</p>
<p>But before she thought about these things clearly, the sudden change suddenly came from the distance of the corridor behind her. Suddenly, there was a huge roar like tearing the heart and lungs. Then, a sharp cry was heard everywhere. Some people were furious, some were afraid, they were angry, scolded and crying, and they were all blown by the wind.</p>
<p>Xiaobai&rsquo;s figure flickered and swept towards the place where the cry came from. Until now, she really confirmed that something strange had happened in Huqi mountain, which she did not know, and most of them were terrible changes!</p>
<p>Before her soul&rsquo;s figure flies rapidly in the corridor, and in the empty corridor just now, suddenly many people come out of nowhere. Only some people run away from the distance, but more people rush to the place where they roar with their blades. In the distance, some people cry and shout, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; ; again, again. This time, Lao Li is crazy&hellip;! &quot; ;</p>
<p>Xiaobai&rsquo;s heart suddenly sank. Then, her figure was swept close and stopped by a lot of people.</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s face with the intention of killing, but Xiaobai can clearly see that behind their murderous, more is fear. Among the crowd, a man with blood in his hand roared fiercely like a trapped animal and waved the blade from time to time. There were several people lying at his feet. There were several deep wounds on each of them. It seemed that most of them were difficult to cure.</p>
<p>Xiaozhe was staring at the murderer who seemed to have been completely crazy. Just a moment ago, at the cave entrance, she heard him speak like a normal person and saw him worried. But in a flash, several of his companions were lying at his feet and killed by him, and he himself, like a crazy animal, kept on Roaring and roaring.</p>
<p>People around him roared. A moment later, the crowd surged forward. Lao Li waved his sharp blade to kill people. But in a moment, more and more sharper blades had already chopped him to the ground. After a long time, the crowd scattered slowly. Xiaobai looked at him silently. His body trembled slightly on the ground, and his head full of wounds slowly turned around. For a moment, Xiaobai&rsquo;s His eyes met his eyes.</p>
<p>！” ; boom ;</p>
<p>Like an invisible thunder in her mind, Xiaobai can&rsquo;t help but step back and lose all the blood on her face. The man&rsquo;s eyes turned completely red. Besides killing, there was no trace of human nature at all. Even her thousand year Taoist career seemed to be breathless.</p>
<p>What a madness this space is!</p>
<p>The crowd whispered, slowly dispersed in fear, Xiaobai slowly stepped forward, and slowly approached the body that had lost its life.</p>
<p>Miwo products</p>
<p>The deep red blood flowed silently and slowly seeped into the soil and rock on the ground. That crazy blood red eyes, probably because of the loss of life, has become dark and turned to red. Xiaobai watched deeply. Suddenly, he turned around and looked at the empty corridor.</p>
<p>In the darkness ahead, a strong smell of blood was constantly emitted, just like a greedy bloodthirsty beast, gazing at everything outside and longing for endless blood.</p>
<p>A figure, standing quietly in the dark, looming! (to be continued). )</p>
