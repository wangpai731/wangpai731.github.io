<p>Here is the May day update. Don&rsquo;t hurry to play after watching it. Remember to vote for a monthly ticket first. From now on, you can enjoy double monthly tickets at 515 fans&rsquo; day. You can also have a look at other activities!</p>
<p>At the bottom of the third peak, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s scream with cadence and continuous reverberation attracted the surprise and attention of countless servants. It can be clearly seen that Bai Xiaochun, with a big black pot on his back and wearing seven or eight fur coats, is running hard along the path of the mixed service area at the foot of the mountain.</p>
<p>Even if you look at it from a distance, you may not be able to see Xiaochun&rsquo;s body, but you can definitely see a big black pot running on the ground like a beetle.</p>
<p>In particular, the seven or eight kitchen knives hanging on Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s body collide with each other when he runs, sending out bursts of jingling sound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kill, help, I don&rsquo;t want to die&hellip;&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun yelled as he ran. He ran faster and faster. Xu Baocai, who was behind him, had a black face and a fierce look in his eyes. At the bottom of his heart, he was more anxious and angry.</p>
<p>On the way, he chased Bai Xiaochun, and many servants around him were attracted. Xu Baocai was worried about attracting the Deacon&rsquo;s attention, and he felt a little flustered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop yelling, damn it. Keep your voice down. What&rsquo;s your name? Shut up!&rdquo; Xu Baocai roared, gnawed his teeth, pinched the formula with both hands, and immediately the wooden sword beside him flashed in a flash. The speed was one minute faster, and he went straight to Bai Xiaochun in front of him.</p>
<p>With a bang, the wooden sword directly hits the black pot behind Bai Xiaochun. While there are bursts of buzz, Bai Xiaochun keeps on running.</p>
<p>Xu Baocai gnaws his teeth hard. In front of him, Bai Xiaochun is carrying a big pot on his back, blocking most of his body. He has no way to start and is unwilling to chase him out again.</p>
<p>Two people, one in front of the other, kept running in the mixed service area.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This guy is carrying a pot on his back and running so fast!&rdquo; Xu Baocai is out of breath. Seeing that Bai Xiaochun is running away, the more he pursues, the more he is bent. With his two-layer cultivation of condensing Qi, he has already taken out the strength of sucking milk, but the other side is like a rabbit whose tail has been trampled on, so he can&rsquo;t catch up with him.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more hateful is that I&rsquo;m very tired here, and I haven&rsquo;t treated each other well. However, Bai Xiaochun didn&rsquo;t weaken from the beginning to the end, just like killing a pig.</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, Bai Xiaochun saw the path in front of him. His eyes were excited. The feeling of seeing home almost filled his eyes with tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elder martial brother, help, kill!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun yelled and ran back to the fire kitchen. Zhang daphou and others were stunned and walked out immediately after hearing the miserable scream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elder martial brother, save me. Xu Baocai is going to kill me. I almost lost my life.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun quickly hides behind Zhang daphou.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Xu Baocai?&rdquo; When Zhang daphou heard his words, his fierce light flashed in his eyes. He looked around, but he didn&rsquo;t see half a figure. Just as he was saying this, he saw Xu Baocai&rsquo;s figure in the distance. He was panting.</p>
<p>At the moment, Bai Xiaochun also noticed Xu Baocai&rsquo;s figure and was very surprised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, why is he so slow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang daphou looks down at Xiaochun&rsquo;s eyes, and then looks at Xu Baocai, who has just arrived, panting. The flesh on his face shakes.</p>
<p>Xu Baocai managed to catch up with him. As soon as he got close to it, he heard Xiaochun&rsquo;s surprised words. The voice fell into his ears. He felt that there was a puff of air in his chest. The whole person was about to explode. He roared and his right hand swung to the side. The wooden sword beside him roared out and went straight into the big tree.</p>
<p>Bang, the trees a shock, there is a hole through.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bai Xiaochun, I am at odds with you!&rdquo; Xu Baocai&rsquo;s eyes are full of blood. He stares at Bai Xiaochun and looks at Zhang daphou&rsquo;s huge body. He turns around and hates to leave.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s heart thumping, looked at the big tree that had been penetrated, and looked at the hysterical Xu Baocai. He tried to swallow a mouthful of saliva, and his heart was filled with uneasiness.</p>
<p>Looking at Xu Baocai&rsquo;s back, Zhang daphou flashed across his eyes and took a picture of Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid, Ninth younger martial brother. Although this treasure has a little background, if he dares to come again, our elder martial brother will discount his leg!&rdquo; Speaking of this, Zhang Da Pang&rsquo;s words changed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But ninth younger martial brother, you&rsquo;d better not go out recently. You see you&rsquo;re all thin. Elder martial brother, I&rsquo;ll make up for it. Just a few days later, the perimeter is over his birthday. &ldquo;Love goes to the small and says</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun nodded absently, looking at the hole in the tree that Xu Baocai had penetrated.</p>
<p>Until he followed several senior brothers back to the fire stove room. In his room, Bai Xiaochun sat there. The more he thought, the more uneasy he felt. The wooden sword of the other side could actually pierce a hole in the tree. If it was on him, would he not have died without a corpse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, unless I don&rsquo;t get out of the kitchen in my life, what should he do if he blocks me out of the kitchen&hellip;&rdquo; In Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s mind, it is Xu Baocai&rsquo;s eyes with strong resentment before leaving.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m here to live forever. I can&rsquo;t die&hellip;&rdquo; There is no sense of security, let Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s eyes are gradually bleeding, after a long time, he bit his teeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grandma&rsquo;s, fight, I fight for my life, I&rsquo;m afraid!&rdquo; White small pure eyes in blood red, his character is not so much afraid of death, but rather a serious lack of security, today experienced this scene, a great stimulus to him, will be his persistent temperament.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to practice, I want to be strong!&rdquo; With his eyes on ziding, he takes out the picture of Xiaochuang.</p>
<p>Although he was afraid of death, he had a ruthless spirit. Otherwise, he could not worry about being struck by thunder every time he ordered incense, but he still ordered thirteen times in three years.</p>
<p>At the moment, he launched a fierce attack. According to the action of the second picture, he insisted on sticking to the second picture of about 10 interest, which he insisted on to 15 interest this time.</p>
<p>Despite the pain in his body, sweat beads were dripping on his forehead, and the ruthlessness of Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s eyes did not decrease until he reached 20 breaths. At 30 breaths, the Qi and streams in his body suddenly increased by 10%. He was also black in front of his eyes. After a long time of breathing, he began to practice again.</p>
<p>The next day, the third day, the fourth day For fifteen days in a row, Bai Xiaochun had never been out of the room except eating and drinking. It was very difficult for a new practitioner to insist on such a boring thing, but he did not give up at all.</p>
<p>Zhang daphou and others were also surprised by Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s practice. It is not easy to learn the practice of Ziqi controlling Ding Gong. In principle, although it is easy to learn, each layer of action will cause unspeakable pain after a long time. It requires great perseverance to persist in it for a long time. On weekdays, the servants of the clan often practice once in a few days.</p>
<p>At present, Bai Xiaochun has been practicing for half a month. Zhang daphou and others come to visit him one after another, and they see a totally different Bai Xiaochun in their memory.</p>
<p>His clothes were wrinkled, his hair was messy, his eyes were bloodshot. He looked very embarrassed, but he was very serious. Even though he was in pain, he never stopped.</p>
<p>Even his body has obviously lost a large circle, and the spirit power in his body has increased by more than half, which is infinitely close to the great perfection of condensing gas.</p>
<p>It seems to be that the Tiancai Dibao accumulated in the fat was refined in an extreme way, and became a part of self-cultivation, and the body was much stronger than ordinary people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ninth younger martial brother, take a rest. You have been practicing day and night for most of the month.&rdquo; Zhang daphou and others hastily persuade, but what they can see is the firm gaze in the raised white small pure eyes. The persistence makes Zhang daphou and others feel shocked.</p>
<p>As time goes by, Bai Xiaochun has been practicing for a whole month. In the past month, his madness has shocked Zhang daphou and others. In Zhang&rsquo;s words, Bai Xiaochun is not practicing, but playing with his life.</p>
<p>In the second picture, under Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s practice, he finally broke through a hundred breath and reached more than one hundred fifty. The aura in his body was no longer a stream, but was obviously huge.</p>
<p>A month later, Zhang daphou and others were all frightened. They were afraid that one day Bai Xiaochun would play with himself to death, and even planned to quietly waste Xu Baocai, a roar came from Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s room.</p>
<p>With the sound reverberating, a second layer of condensate pressure immediately erupted from Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s place and spread over a radius of more than ten meters. Zhang daphou and others who were cooking immediately looked up and moved one by one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The younger martial brother has broken through!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The second layer of condensate, although there are meals added from time to time in our kitchen, can become the second layer of condensate in less than half a year, which is also very rare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It took me a whole year to get to the second condensate layer&hellip;&rdquo; Just as Zhang daphou and others lamented, the door of Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s room creaked open. Her face was tired and her body was dirty. But Bai Xiaochun, who was shining in her eyes, stepped out.</p>
<p>Zhang daphou and others just came forward to say hello, but Bai Xiaochun suddenly fell on the fence wall of the fire kitchen yard. He stood there with his hands on his back, and looked at the distance with his head held high. He looked deep and lonely as an expert.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is he doing there? It looks strange&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Younger martial brother, this is Are you crazy Zhang daphou and others looked at each other.</p>
<p>When people are surprised by Bai Xiaochun, I hear her voice of aging on the fence wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Xu Baocai is the peerless Tianjiao in the Lingxi clan&rsquo;s factotum. No one knows about his fierce reputation. His accomplishments have reached the astonishing second level of condensation gas, and I am also the second layer of condensate gas. In this battle, we are equal. Although we can spread the world and make a stir in the sect, we must have flesh and blood, broken bones and tendons No, this war is very important. I will continue to practice! &quot;</p>
<p>After that, Bai Xiaochun took a deep look at the distance. With a swing of his sleeve, he returned to the house again. With the door closed, Zhang daphou and others swallowed their saliva one by one. You look at me, I look at you. For a long time, black three fat asked for an uncertain question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did we eat something wrong for younger martial brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s over, younger martial brother&rsquo;s aura is at the head, and Xiu is crazy Let&rsquo;s leave him alone Huang Er Pang shivered for a moment and said definitely.</p>
