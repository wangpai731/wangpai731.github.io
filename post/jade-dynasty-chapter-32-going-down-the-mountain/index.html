      <p>When Qi Hao and Zeng Shushu saw Zhang Xiaofan here, they all greeted him more or less with a smile. Only Lu Xueqi was still indifferent, but his eyes still glanced at him. There seemed to be some unknown emotions in his eyes, but they disappeared in a flash.</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan looked at the four people in the hall and said with a smile, &ldquo;let the four of you come here today. There&rsquo;s one thing. Let you go down the mountain to practice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Qi Hao and others moved together.</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan then told the story of &ldquo;wanbat ancient cave&rdquo; in kongsang mountain the day before yesterday, and said: &ldquo;this matter matters a lot. The four of you are the elites of our family, so we will send you to investigate it. But you should be careful to deal with the treachery and ferocity of demons. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the four</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan nodded and said: &ldquo;in addition, in addition to our Qingyun gate, burning incense Valley and Tianyin temple have sent outstanding disciples to track down together. You can&rsquo;t be disrespectful in front of people, but you can&rsquo;t break the momentum of our Qingyun gate. In addition, elder martial brother Xiao Yicai of changmen has already gone to kongsang mountain to trace this matter. If you find him, you will discuss everything. &quot;</p>
<p>The four looked at each other and agreed.</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan took a close look at the four younger generation of disciples. Finally, his eyes fell on Qihao and waved: &ldquo;Qihao, come here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Qi Hao was stunned for a moment, and walked forward. Immortal daoxuan looked at him up and down. He turned to Taoist Cangsong and said with a smile, &ldquo;younger martial brother, there are descendants of dragon head peak!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taoist Cangsong&rsquo;s face was not good-looking from the beginning. At this time, he finally showed some smiles and said with a smile, &ldquo;elder martial brother is laughing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan took something out of his arms with a smile, handed it to Qihao, and said, &ldquo;take it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Qi Hao takes a look, but it&rsquo;s a small mirror with an ancient and humble shape. It&rsquo;s carved in bronze, with dragons on the top, tigers on the bottom, and eight trigrams on the mirror. But the middle lens is not a common copper mirror. It&rsquo;s not clear that it&rsquo;s yellow.</p>
<p>Qi Hao hasn&rsquo;t responded yet. The immortal Cangsong beside him is already beaming. &ldquo;Silly boy,&rdquo; he said. What are you still doing? Kneel down and thank you. &quot;</p>
<p>Qi Hao immediately woke up and knew that the most inconspicuous thing in his hand was the magic weapon &ldquo;six mirrors&rdquo;. He quickly knelt down and said: &ldquo;thank you very much, master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan said with a smile: &ldquo;no need, no need. Get up. &quot; Say to other humanity: &ldquo;you go out first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they knew that he was going to teach Qi Hao the secret of six directions mirror, they withdrew together.</p>
<p>When he got out of the hall, Zhang Xiaofan first and Tian couldn&rsquo;t walk to one side. Tian couldn&rsquo;t look at him. He said lightly, &ldquo;now you are under a heavy responsibility, don&rsquo;t go back to Dazhu peak. After a while, go down the mountain with the three of them. I&rsquo;ll tell you about Dazhu peak for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was shocked, then lowered his head and said in a low voice, &ldquo;yes. Master. &quot;</p>
<p>Tian is not easy to say: &ldquo;in this month of your healing, I heard that your teacher&rsquo;s mother has handed you some martial arts and secrets. Have you written down all of them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan nodded his head and said, &ldquo;yes, I have written down all my disciples.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian is not easy to turn around, slowly said: &ldquo;that&rsquo;s good, although your qualifications are not good, but always under the gate of my big bamboo peak, don&rsquo;t lose face when you go out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan immediately said, &ldquo;yes, master, I will never lose your face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian doesn&rsquo;t sing easily. His back, Zhang Xiaofan also can&rsquo;t see his face, I don&rsquo;t know what his expression is, but listen to his voice. But there was no anger. For a while, Tian didn&rsquo;t seem to sigh. He turned around and looked at Zhang Xiaofan. He didn&rsquo;t say much. He waved his hand. He said hello. Then sacrifice the immortal sword to break the sky.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan watched master&rsquo;s figure change into a red light and disappeared in the sky, until he was patted on the shoulder, and was shocked. He quickly turned around, but it was the smiling Zeng Shushu. Then he looked around. The first of the other veins had gone, only the two of them and Lu Xueqi standing in the distance.</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu said with a smile: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you won&rsquo;t pass this time, even if you&rsquo;re dead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan felt more relaxed when he was with him. He smiled and said, &ldquo;yes, I was scared to death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu patted him on the shoulder, looked back and forth at him, and whispered, &ldquo;why didn&rsquo;t you bring the little ash?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan said with a bitter face, &ldquo;I was brought by Shifu in the morning. I didn&rsquo;t expect to go down the mountain immediately. I didn&rsquo;t bring anything. Where do I want to get Xiaohui?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu said with a smile, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s OK. I can borrow clothes from you. We can buy them in Heyang city under the mountain.&rdquo; Said he to Zhang Xiaofan blinked, whispered: &ldquo;ha ha, anyway, we can earn this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan did not understand his meaning and said, &ldquo;what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu&rsquo;s eyebrows raised and glanced at his back. He he chuckled and said, &ldquo;there are beauties walking with him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan is angry and funny, but he still looks at Lu Xueqi. At the same time, it seems that Lu Xueqi is also sensitive. They look at each other from afar. Zhang Xiaofan only thinks her eyes are like frost, startled, and quickly looks away.</p>
<p>They talked and laughed for a while. Zeng Shushu was whispering to him how to get on the road with Lu Xueqi, but suddenly found that Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s smiling face suddenly stiffened, his eyes also became straight, and he stared at his back.</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu was slightly confused. He turned around and saw that under the long steps, a man came up. He was in his forties. His clothes were clean, but his face was dazed and his eyes were dull. He said something in his mouth that was not followed by his foreword</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s raining. It&rsquo;s dark. It&rsquo;s smelly. It&rsquo;s fairy. It&rsquo;s fairy. Hey, it&rsquo;s fairy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Under the gaze of Zeng Shushu and Lu Xueqi, Zhang Xiaofan walked in the past. He walked very slowly, as if after a long time, he came to the man.</p>
<p>Like, to the past!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle Wang, are you ok?&rdquo; He tried hard to suppress the excitement, low tunnel.</p>
<p>The man seemed to have no Zhang Xiaofan in his eyes. He still said something in his mouth. He walked away from Zhang Xiaofan, and soon disappeared behind the hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo; Zeng Shushu came to him and asked.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan looked at the place where Wang Er Shu disappeared and said sadly, &ldquo;a madman!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu looked at his face and asked no more. After a while, Qi Hao came out of the hall with a happy face and said hello to the three of them.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan went over with Zeng Shushu absently. Several people discussed and decided to go down the mountain to Heyang city first.</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu said to Qi Hao with a smile, &ldquo;elder martial brother Qi, is the Six Harmonies mirror handed down to you by the head martial uncle powerful?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Qi Hao said with a smile, &ldquo;the Six Harmonies mirror is the most precious treasure of our Qingyun sect. It&rsquo;s natural and powerful. I&rsquo;m afraid I don&rsquo;t have enough practice! ha-ha. Well, this is the top of the mountain. Other disciples can&rsquo;t control the sword except for the first seven veins. Let&rsquo;s go down to the sea of clouds. From there fly the imperial sword to Heyang city. &quot;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s face was expressionless, Zhang Xiaofan nodded at a loss, and only Zeng Shushu smiled. It seems that going down the mountain is a happy event for him, a funny person.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>From Qingyun gate to Heyang city. On this way, four of the most &ldquo;excellent&rdquo; disciples of Qingyun sect came from Yujian. Others were relaxed and comfortable, but Zhang Xiaofan had some difficulty.</p>
<p>In January, Su Ru seemed to have expected that he would be OK. She passed on some secrets of Qingyun sect, and passed on the way of how to drive the magic weapon to fight against the sky. In fact, it&rsquo;s also simple. As long as the Dao line is deep enough, the magic weapon is not too much. It can be driven by Qingyun Daoism supplemented by mental power. However, Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s cultivation is not deep. The magic weapon is not bad, but it&rsquo;s very strange. It&rsquo;s also strange to the new Qingyun sect method. It&rsquo;s a big trouble to use it.</p>
<p>At the beginning, Su Ru didn&rsquo;t expect that he would go down the mountain as soon as he got to Tongtian peak. He also wanted to let him remember the Dharma formula first, and then let him practice more after returning to Dazhu peak. Of course, the first one of the other veins didn&rsquo;t know the details of this strange boy. Seeing his performance in the martial arts test of seven veins, he thought that he knew the most basic way to defend the sword. But I didn&rsquo;t know that Zhang Xiaofan had learned Taoism secretly, and he was muddled to the state of &ldquo;driving things&rdquo;. But I don&rsquo;t know how to use the sword.</p>
<p>Watching other people sacrifice the immortal sword, Qi Hao is a white &ldquo;cold ice&rdquo; immortal sword, Lu Xueqi is a blue &ldquo;Tianya&rdquo; immortal sword, Zeng Shushu is a fairy sword with purple air - &ldquo;Xuanyuan&rdquo;. Zhang Xiaofan is nervous. Strong hold up the sacrifice of &ldquo;fire stick&rdquo;, but in the sense it seems to be a little worse, there is no sense of seven pulse will be handy that day.</p>
<p>It was a half day&rsquo;s journey through the clouds and the mountains, but the four people didn&rsquo;t arrive at Heyang city until the sun set. Zhang Xiaofan and the other three fell to the ground in a quiet place outside Heyang city to avoid suspicion. The whole body is wet and pale. It seems that this situation is even more difficult than that of the test.</p>
<p>This way in the sky, he can&rsquo;t master the fire stick several times. If Qi Hao and others don&rsquo;t see it right beside him, they dare not stay too far away from him, and help him in time. I&rsquo;m afraid that his recent &ldquo;outstanding disciple&rdquo; of Qingyun sect will inevitably fall down from the sky and die in pieces. Before he won the honor of the school, he will die for thousands of years, leaving Qingyun sect shameless. Qi Hao and others decided to stop outside the city and walk into the city. Although they wanted to avoid suspicion, they were afraid that in case of downtown in the city, Zhang Xiaofan could not survive in full view of the public. The lofty prestige that Qingyun gate had worked hard to establish in the past two thousand years would be destroyed. Alas!</p>
<p>After a short rest, when Zhang Xiaofan calmed down, the four of them walked towards the tall Heyang city in the setting sun.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan walked at the end and felt that Qi Hao and Lu Xueqi were always casting puzzled eyes. Obviously, they could not understand why a person who was brilliant in the seven pulse martial arts test could not even use ordinary sword. However, Zeng Shushu still laughs and walks with Zhang Xiaofan. He never mentions what happened just now. He talks about Heyang city to Zhang Xiaofan</p>
<p>&ldquo;Within a hundred miles, this is the biggest and most prosperous place. There are at least two or three hundred thousand people living in this city, and they have a good geographical location. There are a lot of business trips and they are also busy. &quot;</p>
<p>Hearing this, Zhang Xiaofan admired Zeng for his erudite knowledge and said, &ldquo;how can you know everything about books?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ceng Shu&rsquo;s writing has acquired color, and said: &ldquo;what&rsquo;s this? If you read more books, you will naturally know.&rdquo; He said with a sly smile on his face. He whispered to Zhang Xiaofan, &ldquo;actually, I&rsquo;ve been here many times. I&rsquo;ve been running down the mountain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was shocked and said, &ldquo;you, you&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shuzui turned away and said, &ldquo;look what you look like? What&rsquo;s in it. Since I learned the art of sword defense, I have to practice it often. It&rsquo;s great to fly here and go shopping when I&rsquo;m tired! &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was dumb.</p>
<p>Listen to the two of them murmuring behind, Qihao smiled and said to Lu Xueqi: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s late, junior sister Lu. Let&rsquo;s spend the night here tonight and go tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s face was cold as ice, without any expression, but nodded lightly.</p>
<p>When they entered the city, they changed the clothes of the disciples of Qingyun sect in the early morning to avoid troubles. There was no doubt about it, but Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s beautiful appearance caused quite a stir, which made many passers-by stop to watch. Zhang Xiaofan takes a look at Lu Xueqi. Although her face was expressionless, there was a flash of anger in her bright eyes. I couldn&rsquo;t help worrying about these passers-by. In case Tianya goes out of its sheath, I&rsquo;m afraid that the ancient city with a long history will be destroyed in the first half.</p>
<p>But Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s self-cultivation is obviously much better than Zhang Xiaofan expected. Until they lived in an inn called &ldquo;shanhaiyuan&rdquo;, Lu Xueqi had no movement. Qi Hao has the most experience among the people. He is the leader of the four people. He is also in charge of such things. Then they are arranged to live in the best backyard by the shopkeeper.</p>
<p>This mountain and sea garden is quite large. There are four individual gardens in the backyard. Four of them live in the west garden, each with a house. After a rest, Qi Hao calls everyone. Go to the front restaurant for dinner.</p>
<p>Shanhaiyuan has its own restaurant, which is located on the most lively street in Heyang city. But in the VIP Hall on the third floor, it is very clean. There are less than ten tables in the spacious hall. Now there are about five tables with guests eating. Qi Hao called waiter and ordered several dishes. It seems that he is familiar with this place. Most of them are regular customers.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan thought in his heart that he came from a peasant family. I&rsquo;ve never been to such a luxurious place as shanhaiyuan. I saw the magnificence of the hall when I passed the second floor just now, but when I went to the third floor, I saw carved dragon, painted Phoenix and Redwood beams. It&rsquo;s very different from the second floor. Naturally, he didn&rsquo;t know that if the people in the world came to the place of wealth, they would instead pursue the status and taste. Even though some people like the brilliance and luxury, in order to let people say that they have some self-cultivation, they often attach themselves to vulgarity.</p>
<p>The four of them sat on a small table by the window. Zeng Shushu took a look at the layout in the hall and said to Qi Hao, &ldquo;elder martial brother Qi, isn&rsquo;t the price cheap here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Qihao smiled and said, &ldquo;this is the best restaurant in Heyang city. It&rsquo;s not cheap. But our Qingyun gate has a reputation here. Their boss would like us to come and won&rsquo;t charge us much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu said &ldquo;ah&rdquo; with a nod. After a while, the waiter brought several plates of vegetables and sauteed them on the table. At last, there was a plate of fresh stewed fish. Look at the fish&rsquo;s body extended, its front was sub round, its back was narrow, its body was dark brown, it had two pairs of whiskers, and it was thick and long. The most important thing is that the meat is white and moist, and the fragrance overflows all over the place, which makes people eat and move.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan has always been interested in cooking. He has never seen this kind of fish before. He can&rsquo;t help but say to the waiter, &ldquo;little brother, what kind of fish is this fish, and how is it cooked?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The waiter smiled and said: &ldquo;my guest, you have a good eye. This&rdquo; stewed fish &ldquo;is the signature dish of our shanhaiyuan. It&rsquo;s fragrant, tender and sweet. It&rsquo;s very famous in this Heyang city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan swallowed his saliva, picked up his chopsticks and put them into his mouth. He immediately closed his eyes and nodded: &ldquo;ah, the meat is good, but it&rsquo;s cooked better. In the sweet part, he put some sugar, and added ginger slices to make it smell fishy. Er, it must be fresh shallot head with the smell of fried shallot. Ah, the most rare thing is to match pepper, five spices, eh, and sesame oil with such a good taste Harm, great! &quot;</p>
<p>His face was intoxicated, and Qi Hao and Zeng Shuji stared at him. Lu Xueqi also looked at him, with a strange look on his face. But the waiter standing beside him admired him very much. He said loudly: &ldquo;my guest is really a connoisseur. He knows the goods!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan just noticed the appearance of the people around him. His face was red. He quickly put down his chopsticks, but he asked, &ldquo;excuse me, little brother, where does this sleeping fish come from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before the waiter spoke, he heard a woman&rsquo;s voice at a big table next door: &ldquo;this sleeping fish is a special product of Zhugou mountain in the south. It&rsquo;s thousands of miles away from here. How can it be transported? Aren&rsquo;t you a liar?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were surprised and looked over. There were eight people sitting on the big table, six men in yellow, and two women. One was in a long Lavender dress and covered with a light veil. She couldn&rsquo;t see her face clearly, but her skin was white. The other was a young speaker. She was only 16 or 7 years old. She was in a water green dress and had a beautiful appearance Beauty, thin eyebrow and snow skin, a pair of bright big eyes are extremely smart, which makes people bright at present. It&rsquo;s no less than Lu Xueqi.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan said &ldquo;ah&rdquo;, but when he saw the woman saying this, his eyes fell on Lu Xueqi at his table. It seemed that Lu Xueqi was also shocked by her appearance. The woman who loves beauty is Lu Xueqi, who is usually cold as ice. At the moment, I couldn&rsquo;t help but look at the woman more.</p>
<p>The waiter then said with a smile, &ldquo;my guest said, but you don&rsquo;t know that this sleeping fish was unique to Zhugou mountain in the south a hundred years ago, but later, immortal xuandao of Qingyun sect passed Zhugou mountain.</p>
<p>Specially, the sleeping fish was moved back and placed in the Hongchuan of Qingyun Mountain. Now it not only survives, but also gradually flourishes. We are all entrusted with the blessing of Taoist immortal on Qingyun Mountain, so that we can have such a blessing! &quot; He said. And there was a look of reverence on his face.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan and other Qingyun disciples saw it, naturally they were all happy and smiling, but the girl heard it, looked back at the woman with the veil on her face, sat back, and snorted.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>After a delicious dinner, Zhang Xiaofan and others went back to their residence with satisfaction. Qi Hao said to all the people at the gate of Xiyuan, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s have a rest here tonight. Tomorrow morning. We will rush to mount Kong sang. &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan and Zeng Shushu answered, but Lu Xueqi didn&rsquo;t say a word, so she went back to her room and slammed the door. Qi Hao stayed for a while, smiled bitterly at the two of them, and said, &ldquo;younger martial brothers, please have a rest earlier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan glanced at his handsome face, only to see that under the setting sun, Qi Hao&rsquo;s spirit was not inferior to that of the past, on the contrary, he had a sense of coming out of the world. All of a sudden, I was so frustrated that I couldn&rsquo;t bring myself up. I barely said hello to Zeng Shushu, but I didn&rsquo;t even pay attention to Qi Hao. Walk back to your room.</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu laughed and joked with Qi Hao. They went back to their room to have a rest.</p>
<p>This night, Zhang Xiaofan left Qingyun Mountain for the first time in five years, turning over and over. I don&rsquo;t know why he didn&rsquo;t sleep well. It was not easy to fall asleep in the middle of the night. However, he dreamed that he was covered with blood and stood in the blood sea. At the same time, there was a fanatical sense of killing in his heart, as if the red blood in front of him was like sweet spring water, attracting him, luring him, making him want to get all this through killing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan woke up from his dream, sat up abruptly, gasped for breath, and was drenched in sweat. After a while, his beating heart slowly came down.</p>
<p>He sat in the dark for a long time, unconsciously reaching for his hand and touching the burning stick beside his pillow. A cold feeling surrounded him. This dream is very similar to the nightmares he has been dreaming about all these years. It seems to change into another person&rsquo;s situation. The murderous man who eats blood in the dream makes himself afraid.</p>
<p>There was no sound around, it was dark.</p>
<p>He straightened up in the dark, took a deep breath, closed his eyes and put his hands together in front of him.</p>
<p>Darkness is like a gentle woman, gently winding his body, a layer of light of gold, looming out of his body. Reflecting the light, Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s face seemed to be covered with a layer of dignity that he did not deserve.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how long it took for the golden light to dissipate. Zhang Xiaofan opened his eyes in the dark and was in a peaceful mood. At this time, he missed the kind monk Puzhi very much.</p>
<p>He was not sleepy any more. He went to the door, opened it and went out. The next few rooms are all dark. I think Qi Hao and them are all asleep. The backyard of shanhaiyuan is built in a garden, and there are four courtyards in four directions of southeast, northwest and North. Zhang Xiaofan went out of the west garden where he lived and went to the garden in the center.</p>
<p>At this time, it was already deep in the night. Looking up at the sky, the stars were all over the sky, and a full moon hung in the sky. The night wind is blowing, with a faint fragrance. The path is winding and deep, leading to unknown places ahead. Roadside, grass and shrubs, all kinds of flowers, everywhere.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was at a loss. He walked down the path with a breeze blowing on his face, bringing a sense of coolness.</p>
<p>Such a quiet night, a young man, alone in the deep garden come, aftertaste the past.</p>
<p>Beside the road, a small flower trembles in the night wind, with crystal dew, attached to the pink and white petals, exquisitely carved. Zhang Xiaofan stops and is stunned.</p>
<p>Faint fragrance comes from the dark.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a slender jade hand, as if from the eternal darkness, with a quiet and clear beauty, imprinted with the moonlight and stars in the sky, came to this flower.</p>
<p>Fold it off!</p>
<p>At that moment, Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s brain made a &ldquo;boom&rdquo; sound, as if the whole sky and moon had lost their luster, and the garden suddenly fell into darkness.</p>
<p>He turned his head and looked at the past with a sense of inexplicable hatred.</p>
<p>A young girl in a water green dress, standing there, seemed to catch the light of the sky, gently put the flowers in front of her nose, and smelt them deeply.</p>
