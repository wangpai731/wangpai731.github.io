<p>The roar startled the sky and shook. All the trees around him trembled, and many leaves fell down one after another, and a strong wind swept over and rolled up in all directions.</p>
<p>When Bai Xiaochun heard the roar, he almost jumped up. When he looked up, he saw elder Zhou with white hair all over the air, and was rushing with his green veins.</p>
<p>At this moment, elder Zhou&rsquo;s ferocious appearance seems to be similar to that of the Phoenix a month ago</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bai Xiaochun, you hurt my husband Fengniao. Even if Li Qinghou comes here today, I will teach you a lesson hard!&rdquo; The circumference old roars, the voice is like thunder rolling, when the right hand is raised, he grabs Bai Xiaochun from afar.</p>
<p>With this grasp, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s surroundings seemed to be solidified. He shivered in the bottom of his heart and gave out a shrill scream. His whole skin was shining silver in this instant. At the same time, there was a white light flashing outside his body. At this moment, the God crane shield suddenly opened and looked like an egg shell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kill, kill!&rdquo; In the twinkling of light on Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s body, his speed suddenly burst out. Under the pressure of the old perimeter, he rushed out, without any hesitation, and ran forward rapidly.</p>
<p>Elder Zhou said softly. Although he didn&rsquo;t exert all his strength, as a monk in the early stage of foundation construction, it was difficult for him to break free even if it was just a force. Now he saw the light of protection outside Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s body, and the old voice of Zhou came out again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bai Xiaochun, don&rsquo;t think I don&rsquo;t know. Since you entered the fire stove, I&rsquo;ve been harming me. You&rsquo;ve eaten up all the ginseng and whiskers that I&rsquo;ve put into the soup. You also gave me the bad idea of shallow dishes. Now I&rsquo;m prescribing medicine for my Phoenix!</p>
<p>I want to let you know today that living in a serious place can not make you mischievous Elder Zhou&rsquo;s body shook and chased out again. They all knew all about the fire kitchen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t blame me, it&rsquo;s your bird who wants to take the pill. It really has nothing to do with me!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun was wronged to the extreme. Seeing that Zhou Changlao was fierce and his cultivation was unfathomable, he was at full speed, and his figure was about to turn into a shadow and move forward rapidly.</p>
<p>After hearing Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s words, the male Phoenix in the air, as if he had been plucked, all the hair on his body stood up, and immediately gave out a shrill scream. He kept pointing at Bai Xiaochun with his wings. If he could open his mouth, he would be hysterical to tell everyone that it was Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s medicine, not his own robbery!!</p>
<p>&ldquo;You You&hellip; &quot; When Bai Xiaochun saw that the Phoenix had falsely accused himself, he was depressed to the extreme. He never thought that one day, with his own intelligence, he would be framed by a bird one day.</p>
<p>He hated it in his heart, and his eyes fell on the bird. He had already thought about it. When this matter is over, he must make the bird look good. Even if the other side is male, he also needs to find a stronger male bird to come and bring down the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How dare you argue!&rdquo; Zhou Changlao runs fast and goes straight to Bai Xiaochun. With a big sleeve swing, a strong force suddenly separates from the air and falls directly on Bai Xiaochun. However, Bai Xiaochun is just a stagger, just like nothing else. On the contrary, he borrows strength faster.</p>
<p>This scene made Zhou Chang open his eyes. He changed his strength to other disciples and immediately fell down and stopped. But Bai Xiaochun was OK.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s heart was shocked. Just then, he grinned with pain, and his heart trembled. Seeing Zhou Changlao approaching, he took out the golden black sword, and his spiritual power suddenly broke out. In an instant, the golden black turned into a golden rainbow and ran straight into the sky.</p>
<p>Zhou Changlao Leng hum, like fly out, with the Phoenix around, chase and go.</p>
<p>All the disciples of Xiangyun mountain who were watching here all felt happy and gloated. Watching Bai Xiaochun run for his life, he had a breath in his heart and exhaled happily.</p>
<p>Chen Ziang and Zhao Yiduo are smiling like flowers on their faces. As for Liu Er Ge, who claims to be the Lord of wolf, his tears are almost left behind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaven has eyes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the mid air of Xiangyun mountain, Bai Xiaochun screamed in a shrill voice, which was enough to make people who heard it cry out loud enough to be startled when they did not see who was calling out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elder Zhou, your bird is lying. What I said is true, but your bird is fake.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun wants to cry without tears, stepping on Jinwu desperately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo; Elder Zhou listened to Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s words about your bird and your bird. Especially when he saw many people around him, he looked strange. He was angry, ashamed and roared. He pinched a key in his right hand and immediately pointed out that the wind was flying out. His speed increased sharply, and he went straight to Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what I&rsquo;m saying is true, your bird has slandered me!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun wants to explain, but the wind is howling. The wind is approaching in a flash, and she shivers. Her speed is very high. She goes away again and avoids the wind. The wind falls on the rock beside her. With a bang, a small hole appears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am the leader&rsquo;s younger brother, and my master is the immortal Lingluo!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun looked at the small hole, scalp numb, and quickly moved out of his background.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use to anyone!&rdquo; Elder Zhou frowned. In his capacity, he chased Bai Xiaochun. He felt a little humiliated, but he was really angry. Especially he didn&rsquo;t touch each other, but Bai Xiaochun was as miserable as a mouse whose tail was trampled on.</p>
<p>In Xiangyun mountain, Xu Baocai looks up at this scene. He does not worry about Bai Xiaochun. Instead, he looks very sympathetic and looks at elder Zhou, who is pursuing him. In his eyes, he looks back and remembers the past.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bai Xiaochun, stop for me!&rdquo; The circumference is as old as a roc, and it is approaching in an instant. The Phoenix nearby makes a proud song and points to Bai Xiaochun with his wings from time to time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a disciple of Yaorong. I&rsquo;ve shed blood for the clan, and I&rsquo;ve made contributions to it!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun screamed and ran away. The voice spread everywhere. Even Qingfeng mountain and ziding mountain, many people noticed and looked up. After seeing Bai Xiaochun being chased and killed, they all looked strange. Some even couldn&rsquo;t help laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glory disciples are all for the dead. I can help you live up to the name!&rdquo; Zhou Chang didn&rsquo;t want to kill Bai Xiaochun, but the idea of preparing to teach him a lesson was very strong. At the same time, he raised his right hand and swung it forward. Suddenly, the strong wind spread. Around Bai Xiaochun, there was a whirlpool of wind.</p>
<p>When Bai Xiaochun heard this, he was enveloped by the whirlpool of wind around him, and his cry was even more tragic. His whole body&rsquo;s spiritual power melted into the Jinwu sword, which made the golden light expand in an instant. After taking him out of the wind whirl, he was darkened between Qingfeng mountain and Zhongdao mountain.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s whole body was shining with silver light. As soon as he rushed out, he screamed and ran fast. He knew that Li Qinghou was not in the sect. At the moment, the only one who could save himself was the leader&rsquo;s elder martial brother. When he ran, he went straight to zhongdaoshan.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun ran away under his own pressure several times in a row. The old Zhou was surprised. He secretly said that it was amazing that Bai Xiaochun could come back alive from the crisis of the Luochen family.</p>
<p>But these four weeks people look too much, let elder Zhou&rsquo;s face some hang not live, more angry, the whole body repair into a scattered, again chase out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master, elder martial brother, help me!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun yelled, faster and faster. In a whoosh, he kept avoiding Zhou Changlao&rsquo;s approach and rushed to zhongdaoshan. His body was extremely flexible. Sometimes he jumped up, which made elder Zhou feel a little slippery.</p>
<p>In fact, it is not impossible for him to leave Bai Xiaochun if he develops some magic skills that belong to the foundation building. After all, he just wants to teach Bai Xiaochun a lesson. Once he starts those skills, he is afraid that if he does not grasp the strength well, he will kill Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>But now he didn&rsquo;t meet Bai Xiaochun, who showed such a miserable appearance and scream. Zhou Changlao was more annoyed. When he pinched the formula with his right hand, he pointed to the sky above Bai Xiaochun. Suddenly, dark clouds appeared in the sky above Bai Xiaochun. When the thunder rolled, a flash of lightning flashed out and went straight to Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s eyes were straight. Seeing the lightning fall, the amazing power contained in it made him feel a strong crisis. At the moment, his mind was blank and his eyes were red. He pinched the formula with his hands and pointed up. At once, there was purple gas on his head, and he ran straight to the lightning.</p>
<p>Zhou&rsquo;s eldest brother was startled. He intended to frighten Bai Xiaochun. This flash of lightning seemed to bombard Bai Xiaochun, but in fact it only fell on his side. But now Bai Xiaochun actually resisted. He was about to take back his strength, but he had no time to take it back.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s purple air flew out in an instant, and directly touched the lightning in mid air. It seemed that a purple cauldron suddenly turned into a mirage. After touching with the lightning, it roared and shook in all directions. The purple fog collapsed, and the lightning was dimmed. Although it passed through and fell to the side, the strength was less than half.</p>
<p>White small pure complexion is pale, scream again, gallop far away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elder martial brother help me, master help me, master, you old man&rsquo;s spirit in heaven, help!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elder Zhou stopped, looked at the air, and then looked at Bai Xiaochun. He was shocked. Although he pulled back most of his magic power, the remaining half was enough to seriously injure a monk. However, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s face turned white and his Qi and blood rolled slightly, and he didn&rsquo;t even get hurt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was Du Lingfei and Hou Yunfei have said before that Bai Xiaochun has realized that the purple gas can be transformed into a tripod. However, this power can not be possessed by a seven layer condensate. Indeed, this son has the power to fight against the ninth layer of condensate gas, even stronger! &quot;</p>
<p>Lu qimang, the elder eye of the perimeter, saw that Bai Xiaochun was so arrogant that he was less angry at the bottom of his heart. However, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s scream was too harsh at the moment. He couldn&rsquo;t laugh or cry, and ran after him with a straight face in a cold hum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whether it&rsquo;s the reason of the Phoenix itself, or the reason of Bai Xiaochun, this son&rsquo;s character is obstinate. If you take this opportunity to frighten him, you should be able to make him more restrained.&rdquo;</p>
<hr>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why, I wrote that Bai Xiaochun was beaten and suddenly very happy Cough, call for recommendation ticket!</p>
