      <p>Go to &ldquo;small talk → net&rdquo; to provide you with wonderful novels to read. A kind of Go to &ldquo;small talk → net&rdquo; to provide you with wonderful novels to read.</p>
<p>After studying the last plant and solving the most difficult problem, he didn&rsquo;t pay attention to the cheers of the people around him. From the moment he picked up the prescription of the jade slips, he was immersed in the herbs, and the whole person was in a state of selflessness.</p>
<p>Unless it&rsquo;s thunder rolling, otherwise, all the noise outside can&rsquo;t make him distracted at all, and he doesn&rsquo;t pay attention to others. The alchemy is over.</p>
<p>His move immediately attracted the attention of the people around him. Everyone, including Xu Baocai, looked strangely at Bai Xiaochun. They all had a sense that Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s concept of time was inconsistent with everyone else.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bai Xiaochun is too slow. Everyone else has finished. He has just started. Should the assessment be over?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well? I don&rsquo;t seem to have heard of There is a time limit for the assessment of promoted pharmacists&hellip; &quot; In this public discussion, I do not know who said the last sentence, immediately everyone was stunned for a moment, looking at elder Xu.</p>
<p>Elder Xu hesitated. The examination of the promoted pharmacist was accurate, and there was no time limit. So he stood there and watched Bai Xiaochun refining medicine.</p>
<p>Han Jianye has no pressure at all. He smiles lightly. He thinks Bai Xiaochun is a strong enemy, but after this assessment, he doesn&rsquo;t believe that Bai Xiaochun can surpass himself.</p>
<p>Du Lingfei frowns, how to see Bai Xiaochun, how to feel uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s movements were very fast, and his eyes showed his essence. In the whole world, only the furnace in front of him was left. The plants were quickly changed in his hands, either kneaded into juice or turned into powder. After all of them fell into the furnace, he pinched the formula with his right hand and pointed to the furnace, immediately the ground fire under the furnace burned instantly.</p>
<p>Soon an hour passed, and the instant strong fragrance of medicine diffused directly from the furnace. Bai Xiaochun grabbed the air with his right hand, and a piece of four inch size ink Ling incense flew out. He took it in his hand and looked at it. His brow was locked.</p>
<p>At this moment, all the people around him were in a flash. However, while they were waiting for Bai Xiaochun to turn on the second stove, they slowly found that Bai Xiaochun was holding that piece of ink. Unexpectedly It&rsquo;s been studied again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does he want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now that it&rsquo;s successful, why don&rsquo;t you start a second furnace?&rdquo; Everyone around was stunned.</p>
<p>At the moment, Bai Xiaochun, looking at the ink in his hand, is not satisfied with it. Although it has become, according to his expectation, it should be seven inches in size.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is the problem?&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun pondered over this thought It&rsquo;s three hours.</p>
<p>Once again, the people took out the pure medicine, and even looked around, they were not satisfied.</p>
<p>It was still an hour later, for example, more and more medicine fragrance was needed. Suddenly, a five inch ink spirit fragrance appeared in the furnace.</p>
<p>Du Lingfei&rsquo;s face changed. Chen Ziang and Zhao Yiduo were all surprised. Han Jianye&rsquo;s eyes flashed. He seemed calm, but at the bottom of his heart, he was nervous.</p>
<p>What they are nervous about is not Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s success twice, but Continuous success!</p>
<p>When everyone was surprised, Bai Xiaochun threw his sleeve, and the third herb flew out. His eyes were dignified and he directly opened the third stove. All the disciples around him were staring at each other.</p>
<p>After an hour of silence, suddenly, the furnace suddenly vibrated, and a powerful fragrance of medicine, which suddenly spread out in the rolling process, suddenly appeared in the furnace!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three times in a row, this How can this be possible</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bai Xiaochun, how did he do it? Did he refine the ink spirit before?&rdquo; People around immediately exclaimed, this kind of continuous success, in everyone&rsquo;s eyes, is incredible.</p>
<p>Du Lingfei is short of breath. She stares at Bai Xiaochun. She is like a big wave in her heart. Chen Ziang and Zhao Yiduo all stay there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three times in a row He must be very familiar with Mo Lingxiang, and he is very lucky. Next time, he will fail! &quot; Han Jianye&rsquo;s fist has been grasped, blood in his eyes.</p>
<p>Just when everyone is expecting Bai Xiaochun to open the furnace for the fourth time, Bai Xiaochun takes the six inch ink Lingxiang in front of her and frowns again, leaning on her chin to think.</p>
<p>Such a wait It&rsquo;s five hours.</p>
<p>If it had been for the first time, most of the people here would have been scattered and would not have waited. But now Bai Xiaochun has succeeded three times in a row. As long as he succeeds in the fourth time, he immediately surpasses others and reaches the level of Han Jianye. They are curious and can only wait.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bai Xiaochun is too slow. It&rsquo;s only a first-class elixir. How can he think about it for such a long time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Du Lingfei and Han Jianye, in particular, are staring at Bai Xiaochun and unwilling to leave.</p>
<p>At this time, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s eyes brightened, her eyebrows fluttered and her hands waved. When the grass and trees flew out, she opened the fourth stove. At this moment, people around her were in a state of spirits and looked at them together.</p>
<p>An hour later, the roar came out, not the sound of failure, but because there were too many medicine incense, which spread out after the stove, forming a sound. In the blink of an eye, there was a stronger smell of medicine. In the twinkling of an eye, the smell of seven inch ink appeared in the furnace!</p>
<p>The fourth furnace, success again!</p>
<p>There was an uproar all around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four times in a row!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This kind of thing can still happen How many times can Bai Xiaochun succeed in the end? &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twice qualified, four times Tianjiao. I remember Zhou Xinqi, senior sister Zhou. At that time, she was promoted seven times!&rdquo; When people around her exclaimed, Du Lingfei looked ugly. Although she knew that Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s attainments were far beyond her own, she was very complicated when she saw that the other party had such a big gap with herself in refining medicine.</p>
<p>As for Han Jianye, he was already gnashing his teeth and clenched his fist fiercely. His body was shaking. He didn&rsquo;t want to believe it, but he couldn&rsquo;t turn a blind eye to this scene.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four times, four times is his limit, he must fail all later!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When all of them were in a sensation and had a strong expectation for the success rate of Bai Xiaochun, they found that Bai Xiaochun was holding the fragrance of ink and began to think again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This guy, why is he studying again?&rdquo; Although helpless, but the people around can not leave now, can only look at Bai Xiaochun one by one, expecting him to study less this time.</p>
<p>Time passed. Eight hours later, Bai Xiaochun took a deep breath. Some bloodstains appeared in his eyes. When he was refining the medicine for the fourth time, outsiders didn&rsquo;t know about it, but he understood that he was almost defeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ink spirit fragrance is much more difficult than the miraculous medicine I made before.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s character is stable and meticulous. He carefully recalled the scenes of alchemy before and found out the problem. Only when he determined that there was no more omission, did he open the fifth furnace.</p>
<p>As for the words of the people around him, he turned a deaf ear to them. Once he refined the medicine, his persistence was beyond imagination. Even if outsiders said more, he would never refine it easily if he was not sure.</p>
<p>At this moment, the fifth furnace was opened, and everyone around him was tired from the beginning to the present, and they all had a strong spirit and watched one after another.</p>
<p>Soon, a huge sound reverberated, the fragrance of medicine suddenly spread around, Just smelling the aroma, everyone&rsquo;s heart jumped!</p>
<p>The fifth furnace, success!</p>
<p>Han Jianye sat there, with endless bitterness in his heart. After a long time, he sighed in silence.</p>
<p>This time, many people around him did not wait. Bai Xiaochun threw his sleeve and continued to refine the sixth furnace.</p>
<p>After a while, the loud sound appeared again, and the aroma spread more strongly. The sixth furnace, success!</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s eyes flashed, and without pause, he picked up the herbs and began to refine the seventh furnace. But at the moment when the seventh furnace was about to be completed, suddenly, a trace of burning smell came out. Although it was very slight, only Bai Xiaochun could smell it, but it made Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s heart thump.</p>
<p>His right hand pinches a Jue, suddenly the ground fire temperature drops, finally reluctantly ends, the seventh furnace, again successful!</p>
<p>Only the appearance of ink Lingxiang, only three inches in size, and a lot of impurities, only a few drops off the product, become a poison fragrance, even so, can be seen in the public, is still a success!</p>
<p>At this moment, the spirit of the people around has been thoroughly aroused, one by one shortness of breath, especially Xu Baocai, with incredible eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seven successes My God, Bai Xiaochun has really done it seven times! &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just like sister Zhou Xinqi! I remember it seems that only one elder martial brother named Wang Qingshan did it eight times in the legend. Now he is a high handed disciple! &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As for nine times Never before, no one has ever succeeded! &quot;</p>
<p>In the public outcry, Bai Xiaochun is silent and stares at the stove. Blood appears in his eyes. He has not paid attention to the examination for a long time, but is immersed in the refining of medicine. He thinks hard about the near failure of the talent, and takes out the herbs to observe it again, and slowly finds out the reason.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s this kind of spiritual plant called ink fruit. The ink element contained in each of them is slightly different&hellip;&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun stares at the ink fruit in her hand, constantly analyzing and deducing in her brain.</p>
<p>As time went by, people around him laughed bitterly at Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s meditative appearance. Although excited, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s thinking before refining medicine was really slow and irritating.</p>
<p>Unwilling to leave here, the disciples from all around simply sat down on their knees and waited for Bai Xiaochun. Some of them, tired, leaned on the rocks beside them and fell asleep.</p>
<p>Elder Xu looked strange. He coughed and sat down with his knees crossed.</p>
<p>Du Lingfei and Han Jianye naturally do not want to leave. However, Bai Xiaochun is exhausted physically and mentally, and her eyes are red. At the moment, they have to meditate.</p>
<p>It was quiet all around, and soon there was even snoring. But some people stayed there and looked at Bai Xiaochun all the time. Xu Baocai was one of them.</p>
<p>A few hours later, someone woke up and sighed that Bai Xiaochun was still thinking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s still working on it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s light&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finally, more than ten hours later, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s eyes filled with blood, and suddenly looked up.</p>
