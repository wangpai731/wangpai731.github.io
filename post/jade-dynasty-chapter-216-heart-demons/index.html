      <p>The ghost king went up to Taotie with steady and peaceful steps. Xiao Hui, who was sitting on GUI Li&rsquo;s shoulder, turned his head and looked at the ghost King&rsquo;s back. He called twice and suddenly became quiet.</p>
<p>Taotie, lying on the ground, seemed to feel something. The huge head moved to one side and lifted it up. The huge eyes also opened. Two fierce lights fell on the ghost king who came by. A low roar came out of his big mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roar&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The peaceful and peaceful atmosphere in the room suddenly became inexplicably tense. The head of the gourmet and the hard armor behind him were as hard as the iron sheet. The mouth opened slowly, revealing the terrible and sharp teeth.</p>
<p>The ghost King faced the terrible beast, but he did not show any fear on his face. Instead, he kept flashing a strange light in his back to the ghostly eyes. Among them, there was an irrecoverable ecstasy and desire.</p>
<p>He faced the ferocious beast, who was already angry, and didn&rsquo;t even stop. And behind him, the ghost looked at his back and frowned slightly.</p>
<p>Taotie was obviously unable to bear such a provocation. His ferocious appearance was revealed. In his huge eyes, he gradually turned to red light. His huge body slowly stood up and made an attack posture.</p>
<p>It seems that Zhou&rsquo;s view of ghosts and ghosts is just a reflection of the whole situation.</p>
<p>Finally, when the ghost King approached Taotie and stepped into the distance of three feet, Taotie could not bear it any longer. With a roar, the surrounding stone walls vibrated faintly, and his huge body leaped into the air, flapping his teeth and claws, and rushed to the ghost king.</p>
<p>In the originally peaceful stone chamber, the strong wind suddenly blew along with the huge body. The desks and chairs that had been put in order were blown out in an instant. &ldquo;Bang bang bang&rdquo; hit the wall and broke into several pieces. At that time, the huge animal body has already rushed over the head of the ghost king.</p>
<p>Far away. Monkey Xiaohui gave out a few cries, &ldquo;cheep, cheep&hellip;&rdquo; It just doesn&rsquo;t sound like a worry, but it&rsquo;s a bit of schadenfreude. It seems that this early intelligent monkey doesn&rsquo;t like the ghost king who is in danger at the moment, so he would like to kill the guy with a slap.</p>
<p>However, GUI Li&rsquo;s view is obviously not consistent with Xiao Hui. Originally, her eyebrows were slightly frowned. At the moment, after a few indistinct doubts flashed in his eyes, his wrinkling became tighter.</p>
<p>It seems that in his eyes, at that moment, he saw something he did not expect.</p>
<p>The huge body of Taotie was swept down with the strong wind, and the momentum was amazing. But only for a moment, like ghosts and ghosts, the ghost King&rsquo;s body suddenly disappeared from the impossible place. Taotie&rsquo;s huge momentum of a fight, only a result of the fight.</p>
<p>The next moment, the ghost King&rsquo;s gray figure suddenly appeared. After a moment of consternation, he stretched out his hand and grasped the flesh on the back of his neck like lightning. It seemed that he wanted to use his own magic power to lift the foreign animal that everyone was afraid of as a domestic cat and dog.</p>
<p>This catch seems to be unpleasant, but Taotie can&rsquo;t avoid it. With a low roar, his neck is already under control. But Taotie, after all, is a strange beast. Under his control, he does not have the slightest intention of yielding. Instead, he seems to be more and more angry and roaring. The whole body was tensed at the moment, but the whole body was enlarged by more than three thirds. The ghost King&rsquo;s face changed. At the same time, he felt a stab in his right hand. The palm of his hand, which was protected by the magic teaching method, seemed to be unable to resist the strange force.</p>
<p>The ghost king was not hesitant, and he stepped back three steps after he let go.</p>
<p>GUI Li and Xiao Hui stood aside. It&rsquo;s true to see that there are five red scratches on the iron sheet of Taotie&rsquo;s back neck, which was originally invulnerable. Moreover, the wound is definitely not shallow, and the blood is slowly flowing out.</p>
<p>Taotie raised his head and roared. He was already in a state of fury. He turned back to face the ghost king. Meanwhile, Xiao Hui, who was lying on the shoulder of GUI Li, also jumped up at the moment, dancing with both hands and pointing to the ghost king to &ldquo;squeak&rdquo; and scream, which made him very angry.</p>
<p>Although no one in this stone chamber knows monkey language, but I don&rsquo;t know it. Most of the monkey language in Xiaohui&rsquo;s mouth is also a curse.</p>
<p>Xiao Hui scolded a few words. It seems that he didn&rsquo;t get rid of his hatred. He would jump down to the ground as soon as he could. It seems that he was going to help his friend and repair the evil ghost king. Just its body just jumped up in the air, suddenly stretched out a hand behind him, caught the small ash, and dragged it back, which was very fierce.</p>
<p>Xiaohui was a little surprised and a little annoyed. He kept screaming at the &ldquo;squeak&rdquo; and turned his head around. He was obviously attracted by something in the field.</p>
<p>In the huge roar of Taotie, the huge body with sharp teeth and sharp teeth rushed to the ghost king. This time, the ghost king did not mean to dodge, but just raised his arm.</p>
<p>A dark red light, from the ghost King between the sleeves, silent but instantaneous will be a faint bloody breath, filled the whole stone room.</p>
<p>A more deep and strange roar burst out in the empty space without the sound of cracking silk. However, it seemed that the space in the stone chamber was torn apart. Even though the roar was like a gluttonous and shocking roar, it was dumb.</p>
<p>The dark red light, in a flash, has surrounded the whole body of the ghost king, flickering. The ghost King&rsquo;s figure can not be seen around, and Taotie seems to feel something. In his surprise, he has a bit of fear and can&rsquo;t help but step back.</p>
<p>An ancient tripod, which looks a little broken, slowly rises from the red light. With the appearance of the ancient tripod, the red light in the stone chamber is as red as blood, and there is nothing that can&rsquo;t help but be red. The smell of blood is so strong that it makes me feel sick.</p>
<p>The color of fear in Taotie&rsquo;s eyes was more serious, but under the stimulation of this bloody breath, it seemed that the ferocity hidden in his bones was also lured out. After several hesitations, he did not turn his head and run away, but rushed to the ancient Ding again with a roar.</p>
<p>In the distance, the gruesome brow frowned tightly. The body couldn&rsquo;t help moving for a moment. Then he tried to hold back, and his eyes were fixed on the ancient tripod.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, ten years ago, on Liubo mountain in the East China Sea, he had seen this ancient artifact, only to see you again today, but it seems that it has completely changed.</p>
<p>The huge body of Taotie pounced on the Fulong Ding, but only three feet away from the tripod. Suddenly, there was a roar in the Fulong Ding. It seemed that there was a deep and mysterious mantra murmuring in the void. Then a red light will cover the whole body of Taotie.</p>
<p>Taotie&rsquo;s whole body trembled, his face was extremely painful, and he roared up to the sky. But it seems to have been emptied from the air and fell down. The fierce face on one side changed slightly. The power of the Fulong Ding was beyond his expectation. Obviously, it was not comparable to that time.</p>
<p>In fact, the magic power of Fulong Ding. With the help of Mr. GUI, the ghost King understood the inscriptions on the tripod body, collected the supernatural powers of spirits and beasts, and activated the &ldquo;four spirits blood array&rdquo;. At present, there are three spirits of Kui Niu, huangniao and candlelong in the Fulong tripod. Although Taotie is a foreign beast, it is definitely inferior to the other three, not to mention the ancient artifacts of Fulong Ding. It has strange magic power. The more powerful the supernatural beast is, the more powerful the Demon power of the four spirit blood array is.</p>
<p>Once the enemy was defeated, Taotie was suppressed.</p>
<p>At the moment, however, the red light flickered like an entity, which tightly bound the huge body of Taotie. The whole body of Taotie trembled and was extremely painful, but he could not move at all, and even roared in his mouth. They were fast and low, with only the sound of breathing.</p>
<p>In the stone chamber, the bloody air is heavier. The ghost king looks at the gluttonous food crawling on the ground. The color of ecstasy flashed in his eyes, and he suddenly looked up to the sky and laughed. His shape was very ordinary, like madness.</p>
<p>At this unusual moment, suddenly came the &ldquo;creaky cheeky&rdquo; angry cry, the red light bound Taotie also hard to turn his head to look. It&rsquo;s Xiaohui. It resolutely jumped out of the air, jumped to Taotie&rsquo;s side, and reached out to help, but hongmang saw that there was no brilliance. Xiaohui stretched out his hand, but with a cry, he jumped out and seemed to have suffered a dark loss.</p>
<p>Xiao Hui bares his teeth and looks at the extreme anger. He shows his sharp teeth to the king of ghosts and makes a provocative gesture. The ghost king did not know when, under that piece of glittering blood like red light, his eyes had already become blood red. At the moment, Huoran turned back, and the instant murderous spirit was great. Not to mention, a black gas suddenly jumped up and rushed out from the red light to hit the small ash.</p>
<p>Xiaohui is not an oil-saving lamp or a waste wood monkey. Although he is angry, he can see that the fierce light trembles in the black gas. He refuses to accept it, and jumps to the side several times and flashes past.</p>
<p>When he failed to hit the target, the ghost King roared, and the speed of black gas doubled in an instant. At the same time, it seemed as if it had been divided into several channels. The black gas was like electricity and split from all directions.</p>
<p>He used both hands and feet to hide in Tibet. He was able to evade it in a short time. However, it was dangerous and almost hit by black gas several times.</p>
<p>At the moment, the ghost king did not know why he started his hand at such a monkey. Suddenly, there was a low roar in the black air, and the wind and cloud gathered together. Out of thin air, a blood red palm was condensed. When he hit the head, Xiao Hui was forced to be left and right by the black gas. At the moment, there was no way to go back, and he was about to be hit by the blood red palm print.</p>
<p>At this critical juncture, he suddenly stretched out an arm from the side, crossed the fierce black Qi and blood awn, grabbed the monkey&rsquo;s tail, pulled it outward, and the small gray body immediately flew up and flew backward, and the fierce black gas intercepted behind it, I don&rsquo;t know when, was dispersed.</p>
<p>Xiaohui flies out of the sky safely, but the ghost King hiding in the Red Mansions seems to give out a roar, and the evil spirit is more powerful. The black gas and red awn around him instantly solidify and form. A huge red palm print is photographed to this sudden arm. After the red awn, the Fulong Ding slowly starts to rotate, and the strange awns flow inside the tripod. The strange incantations are looming The meaning of killing.</p>
<p>The blood is dazzling, twinkling between, the face is as heavy as water&rsquo;s ghostly figure appears, it is he who saved Xiao Hui&rsquo;s life at the critical moment. At the same time, he also turned to face the strange Demon power of the Dragon tripod that the ghost king did not stop.</p>
<p>The sound of howling is more and more tragic. In the blood red palm print, a strange Rune with the shape of ancient tripod flickers faintly. It rushes forward and frowns fiercely. But in the face of this peerless magic, it does not mean to shrink back. With both arms waving, before the arrival of the blood red palm print which flies as fast as lightning, a Tai Chi pattern is drawn in front of the body.</p>
<p>The green light suddenly rises, like a clear spring pouring into the deep dry land, and the house is full of blood killing gas. It is really a shock. The pure and pure magic power of Qingyun gate is &ldquo;Taiji Xuanqing Dao&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The red seal of blood came at the next moment and hit the Taiji map.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, there was no great noise and sensation as imagined. On the contrary, as if a mud cow entered the mud, there was no sound at all, but the red blood mark was forced into the air and could not go any further. And on the face of the ghost, instantly become red, such as bleeding to drop.</p>
<p>The fierce eyes flashed and took a deep look at the red awn. A cold hum, feet move, back away. Every time he stepped back, the red blood mark was one point ahead. At the same time, every step back. However, the palms of both hands did not stop for a moment, the fingers were bent up and the Dharma seal changed. The Taiji pattern between the hands was pure and clean, but it did not weaken at all.</p>
<p>When he stepped back to the third step, he made a vase seal in his hand, and the blood red color on his face had eased, and the edge of the Tai Chi diagram had begun to emit a light golden glow; when he stepped back to the fifth step, he turned into a flower picking method seal in his hand, which reflected the golden light and green spirit of the Tai Chi diagram; and when he stepped back from the seventh step. GUI Li is already back against the stone wall, there is no way out, but at this moment, GUI Li&rsquo;s face has been restored to its original state, and there is no strange blood red.</p>
<p>As soon as his hands were shaken, the ghost had already made the seal of Vajra Dharma.</p>
<p>In an instant, the golden light is flourishing, and the solemn Dharma is everywhere. If there are gods and Buddhists around, the sutras are chanted lightly, which is deep and pleasant to the ear.</p>
<p>The Taiji diagram whirls rapidly, and the golden light is bright. The red blood seal is gradually swallowed up by the Taiji diagram and disappears.</p>
<p>The sky is full of gold and blue light. Straight up, it was the ghost King blood awn pressure in the past. And in the depths of the Red Mansions, a roar, it is obvious that the man is already in a rage, the red light flickers and a few moans. The gluttonous food on the ground was sucked up by the red light, and the huge body was sucked in by the Fulong Ding, and disappeared in a flash.</p>
<p>But the ghost King&rsquo;s face gradually penetrated through the red awn, but saw his white hair flying, eyes red, murderous, where there is usually calm appearance, like a murderer maniac. On the contrary, it is more fearless. On the contrary, it is a big step to invade the body.</p>
<p>The Fulong tripod revolves ceaselessly. The strange inscriptions inside the tripod flicker endlessly, and the red light bursts. The ghost king holds up the tripod with his right hand. The huge ancient tripod has fallen on his right hand. It looks like a demon falling from the world. It is extremely terrifying.</p>
<p>However, GUI Li was shining all over his body. Obviously, he had gathered all his magic power and magic power, and he wanted to fight to the death here.</p>
<p>The two great masters confront each other and are full of murders. It seems that both of them have long forgotten the reason for this sudden fight, but at this moment, it seems that they have suddenly lost the reason that they have suppressed for many years. They are fighting with all their strength and dancing in their hearts.</p>
<p>GUI Li strides on, getting closer and closer to the ghost king. The evil spirit in the ghost King&rsquo;s eyes is more and more intense. The Fulong Ding slowly tilts in the mid air and aims at the ghost&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p>A great war is about to break out.</p>
<p>No one would have thought that the two most important characters of today&rsquo;s demon sect are in such a remote stone chamber, inexplicably trapped in a decisive battle between life and death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boom!&rdquo;</p>
<p>…… A loud noise came from the stone chamber.</p>
<p>Ghost king and GUI Li, the two men, seem to see each other&rsquo;s eyes slightly twitch, but at the critical moment, they did not move.</p>
<p>The stone chamber door, slowly fell down, outside the door, slowly appeared a figure, a look to the whole body slightly shaking figure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The voice is thin, with anger, bewilderment and a bit of panic. Youji, who is also the rosefinch in the demon sect, stands at the door.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t see her face under the black veil, but the anger is gushing out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You What are you two doing? Are you both crazy? &quot;</p>
<p>In the stone chamber, there was silence. The two men were facing each other and silent. They did not speak. In the air, the murderous spirit was still lingering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good, good, good!&rdquo; Youji seemed to bite her lips and speak angrily from her teeth. She raised her hand and pointed to a certain direction: &ldquo;kill, kill, all of you are dead. You are clean. Do you remember where, where&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>Her voice was a bit choked, &ldquo;is there anyone lying on the stone platform in that cold stone room? Have you all forgotten? &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who of you still remember the word&rdquo; Biyao &quot;</p>
<p>The red blood awn, quietly dispersed; the dazzling blue light and gold light, gradually disappeared.</p>
<p>The murderous air and bloody smell flowing in the stone chamber, I don&rsquo;t know when, just like the tide.</p>
<p>Only silence still stays here like this and refuses to leave.</p>
<p>Two men, looking at each other, the depths of the eyes, as if there is unspeakable light collision.</p>
<p>Youji stamped her foot with hatred, turned around and left without turning back. Judging from the direction she went, it should be the cold stone room where Biyao was. However, the two men still staying in the stone chamber seem to be still in confrontation, quietly peeping into some secrets.</p>
<p>For a long time, the ghost king suddenly snorted lightly, put the Fulong Ding in his hands and strode out of the room. When he passed by the ghost, the sharp light in his eyes seemed to be dazzling.</p>
<p>At that moment, he did not pay attention to the ghost king, but fell on the Dragon tripod.</p>
<p>There are many minor damages to the ancient tripod of ancient style, but many twisted mysterious inscriptions can still be clearly seen on the dark blue and purple tripod. On the back of the tripod, in the middle of those inscriptions, there is a pattern, which reflects the ghost&rsquo;s eyes</p>
<p>The fire was blazing, and a huge cauldron was being roasted. Around the tripod, there were four kinds of strange beasts, either birds or beasts, roaring up to the sky. Above the giant tripod, black clouds were rolling. It was a ferocious and terrifying face of the demon king, who was gazing at the world with a grim smile.</p>
<p>This pattern is just a flash in front of the ghost, but somehow, it has been deeply printed into the ghost&rsquo;s mind and can not be forgotten. But in his impression, he was so familiar with the face of the devil, but for a moment, he could not remember whether he had ever seen the devil.</p>
<p>The ghost King quickly walked out of the stone chamber and disappeared outside the door. The stone chamber was calm.</p>
<p>Monkey Xiaohui jumped over from the side, jumped on the fierce shoulder, and slowly sat down, but there was no sense of happiness on his face. From time to time, he turned his head to look at the door, and he murmured in his mouth.</p>
<p>Grimly and silently, he reached out and touched Xiaohui&rsquo;s head. After a moment of silence, he sighed, then turned and walked out of the stone chamber.</p>
<p>The long corridor seems to lead to all directions, just like the road of life, no one knows where to go, or even if you think you know, in fact, where the road will lead, who can know?</p>
<p>Half an hour later, GUI Li stopped his steps and was speechless. He found that the place where he stopped was outside the cold stone room.</p>
<p>Thick stone wall, across in front of him, but he suddenly some fear, even in the face of ghost King Fu Long Ding demon law also did not fear him, but now can not help but fear.</p>
<p>The stone door, so quietly, stood in front of him.</p>
<p>Slightly shaking hand, extended to the past.</p>
<p>Like countless times in the past, the stone gate opened with a low roar.</p>
<p>In the first crack, he saw a slim figure standing in front of the cold stone platform. In the air, there seemed to be a clear and familiar bell sound.</p>
<p>He seems to be crazy. (to be continued. )</p>
