      <p>At the moment, Xu Baocai and many other disciples are in the process of medicine apprenticeship promotion. Elder Xu is watching. It was a very serious thing, but at this time, a group of birds flew through the sky, and the sound of puff and puff came up and down Innumerable bird droppings fall in an instant, like rain. Xu Baocai, other disciples participating in the promotion, as well as the onlookers around, and even elder Xu&rsquo;s hair, are all bird droppings at the moment</p>
<p>All of us are in a daze, one by one subconsciously look up, see the group of birds, scattered countless bird excrement, constantly away</p>
<p>&ldquo;The birds Some strange&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn it, what&rsquo;s wrong with them Actually, diarrhea keeps on happening All the disciples, all exclaimed. Elder Xu froze for a moment, and his face changed.</p>
<p>Chen Ziang and Zhao Yiduo are now on a mountain road, glaring at each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Today, the two of us are here. We have to find out&hellip;&rdquo; Their contradiction appeared when they were working in the office. At the moment, it seemed that there was a cruel light in each other&rsquo;s eyes. But at this time, before the words were finished, suddenly on the ground between them, a piece of dust lifted up, and a group of long legged fish flew by.</p>
<p>When they were in a daze, they saw several cats that kept burping and roaring like thunder, chasing those fish. This scene made them take a breath. They had a kind of unreal feeling. They forgot each other&rsquo;s hostility and were stunned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This Did you see the fish with long legs just now Zhao Yiduo thought it was his illusion and asked subconsciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I also saw cats burping like thunder&hellip;&rdquo; Chen Zi&rsquo;ang opened his mouth blankly.</p>
<p>On the hillside of the outer disciples, at the moment, many of the outer disciples screamed. Actually, there were a group of rabbits with red eyes and biting at them. Even if they were stopped, these rabbits were still fierce, and their teeth made a rattling sound, which was shocking.</p>
<p>In particular, there is a rabbit, sitting on several huge chickens, constantly speaking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you talk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha ha, this pill is good. I&rsquo;m really good at white Xiaochun. This rabbit can talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiangyun mountain, this moment, crazy Countless people heard this sentence, and instantly understood that this scene was made by Bai Xiaochun!</p>
<p>In the area where the inner disciples are located, several toads are hopping on the ground. All the disciples who see them take a breath. Those eyes are very dangerous.</p>
<p>There is also a nine headed tiger, in the zongmen rampant, constantly roaring, the whole Xiangyun mountain, this day all chaos, countless people were shocked, go out together.</p>
<p>And a monkey Actually, she climbed up the roof of the attic where Li Qinghou was, stood at the highest point of Xiangyun mountain, and sat there, looking at Xu Meixiang, who had just left to reminisce with Li Qinghou. She was leaning down on her chin and meditating</p>
<p>Li Qinghou, with a livid face, stood outside the attic and looked up at the monkey. Just as he was about to get angry, he heard a lot of bird droppings from the sky, and he was totally stunned.</p>
<p>Xiangyun mountain, has been a long time It&rsquo;s not so busy. Countless outside disciples, as well as inner disciples, all went out. These small animals did not have any impact on them. Only the group of shitting birds, in a short period of time, could not imagine how such a small body could hold so much bird droppings</p>
<p>Then there was the rabbit, who could only say three sentences at first, but gradually, he could say more and more words and learn more and more actions. At the end of the day, even his voice was very loud and he roared at the top of his voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God, what is this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see the rabbit talking?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bai Xiaochun, you must have done it again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you quietly, I saw Zhou Changlao and his birds in a room yesterday, and there was a strange sound coming out of it&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elder martial sister Zhou Xinqi, and elder martial sister Du Lingfei, even if Bai Xiaochun blocks me, I will certainly get you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elder martial brother Hou Yunfei, you are good or bad, don&rsquo;t you Ah What&rsquo;s this? I saw some monkeys, they were twitching</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sister Mei Xiang, it&rsquo;s not that I, Li Qinghou, are ungrateful and ungrateful. When I make a breakthrough in my cultivation and step into the golden elixir, you will become a Taoist partner!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha ha, this pill is good. I&rsquo;m really good at white Xiaochun. This rabbit can talk.&rdquo; The rabbit kept running, saying more and more words, but its ears are very smart. As long as it hears the words, it immediately repeats them vividly, and gradually changes the face of many people. Because this damned rabbit, its ears are so smart, it almost tells all the secrets among the disciples, and also gives names.</p>
<p>There are a lot of stories in it. After listening to them, they are all incredible, especially the section of Li Qinghou This matter has never been heard of before. It has caused a sensation to everyone. Many elders are wide eyed.</p>
<p>Xu Baocai was shocked, Hou Yunfei opened his eyes, and Li Qinghou&rsquo;s body suddenly trembled.</p>
<p>At this time, Bai Xiaochun came back from Fangshi. He came back with a full load, with more small animals, and his eyes showed expectations. This time, he had tested all the strange pills, but he had just gone to Xiangyun mountain. Before waiting for a few steps, a splash of bird droppings fell. Bai Xiaochun quickly avoided it, frowned and looked up at the sky.</p>
<p>I saw a flock of birds flying by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh, I&rsquo;m familiar with you&hellip;&rdquo; When he was surprised, suddenly, the grass beside him was moving, and a group of long legged fish galloped. Bai Xiaochun was stunned, and then the cat belching like thunder ran by again. Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s eyes were almost staring out. Then A group of monkeys were twitching and frothing, passing him quickly.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun trembled and took a breath. His hair was all up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This This No way He was short of breath. He took out the golden black sword and flew up suddenly. His wings were even more like a fan. He rushed to Xiangyun mountain with a cry.</p>
<p>Along the way, he saw all the small animals, and even many people looked at him on the way. They were all strange. Bai Xiaochun was frightened. When he returned to the cave, he found that the gate of the cave was open, and the inside was almost empty. Only the geese stood there like guards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did they come out?&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun thought it was incredible. She looked back and saw a rabbit running. Countless words came out of her mouth, especially the last sentence</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha ha, this pill is good. I&rsquo;m really good at baixiaochun. The rabbit can talk!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s eyes glared. The rabbit immediately saw Bai Xiaochun, and immediately turned around and quickly ran away. Bai Xiaochun knew that he was in trouble, so he quickly stepped forward and was about to catch the rabbit. The rabbit, for some reason, had a sharp increase in speed. In the meantime, he heard Li Qinghou&rsquo;s roar from Xiangyun mountain top 。</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bai Xiaochun, you can handle it yourself. There is a beast that hasn&rsquo;t been dealt with, and there is still a bird droppings. I&rsquo;ll send you to wanshe Valley! Especially the damn rabbit, shut it up</p>
<p>Even though Bai Xiaochun won the first place in Tianjiao battle and the immortal silver skin was great, Bai Xiaochun still shivered. He had a great shadow over the valley of ten thousand snakes. At the moment, he looked up subconsciously, and then his eyes almost glared out.</p>
<p>He saw the top of the attic at the top of the mountain, where a monkey was leaning on his chin, meditating.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun almost cried, and went to the top of the mountain. His body leaped out and went straight to the monkey. The monkey looked at Bai Xiaochun with a look on his side, and his eyes showed a touch of emotion. It seemed that he was enjoying the rare freedom. Bai Xiaochun was stunned. When he raised his hand, he grabbed the monkey in his hand and threw it into the storage bag.</p>
<p>Then he left carefully and ran all the way to Xiangyun mountain. In the strange eyes of countless disciples, Bai Xiaochun was in tears. She grabbed the nine tigers, grabbed the toad with eyes, and left quickly.</p>
<p>Soon, the elephant like chickens, the fish with legs, and the burping cats were all captured by Bai Xiaochun. As for the group of ducks flying in the sky, it&rsquo;s better to catch them and be taken away by Bai Xiaochun a few times.</p>
<p>As for the group of epileptic monkeys, Bai Xiaochun threw them into the storage bag one by one and tossed around all day. The most difficult thing to catch was those shitting birds. It took a lot of effort for Bai Xiaochun to catch them one by one. At night, he counted and counted them, and suddenly found that the rabbit who was learning tongue didn&rsquo;t see it.</p>
<p>After searching for a long time, Bai Xiaochun is frustrated to find that he can&rsquo;t find it. The rabbit can hide too much.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun sighed and looked at the bird excrement on Xiangyun mountain. However, it took him a whole night to clean up the bird excrement in Xiangyun mountain. At sunrise, he dragged his tired body back to the cave, and fell back to sleep tired.</p>
<p>In the early morning, the disciples of Xiangyun mountain looked at the brand-new gate and recalled everything of yesterday one by one. They had a profound understanding of Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s pills. However, almost all of them were stuck with bird excrement and were angry. But they could not help it. After all, they could see that Bai Xiaochun was not intentional.</p>
<p>However, it is this unintentional behavior, which has appeared many times. Everyone cries out in his heart and has an intuitive feeling for Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s terror.</p>
<p>After waking up in the afternoon, Bai Xiaochun did not dare to continue to test strange Dan. He left the mountain gate and went to the wilderness to find a safe wasteland. He opened the storage bag and released all the small animals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are free&hellip;&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun looked at those small animals and said with a bitter smile.</p>
<p>Those little animals that didn&rsquo;t have time to swallow the strange pill scattered in a moment. But those who swallowed the strange pill all looked at Bai Xiaochun, who also looked at them, and took out many pills from the storage bag.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After taking this pill, you may also have some possibility to practice self-cultivation. Don&rsquo;t make trouble in the future. This time you&rsquo;ve done me a lot.&rdquo; Each small animal, Bai Xiaochun gave a pill, finally waved, turned and was about to leave when the nine headed tiger let out a roar.</p>
<p>When Bai Xiaochun looked back, nine tigers looked at her. There was a strange light in her eyes, as if she wanted to remember Bai Xiaochun firmly. Then she turned around and ran away.</p>
<p>The ducks in the sky, and the birds, the fish on the ground, the burping cats, even the guard like geese, the toads with eyes, and the twitching monkeys, all looked like nine tigers. They looked at Bai Xiaochun strangely, and then they scattered.</p>
<p>The last one who left was the monkey who liked to meditate. He looked at Bai Xiaochun and saw a light of wisdom in his eyes. He gave Bai Xiaochun a sense of vicissitudes.</p>
<p>It took a deep look at Bai Xiaochun and turned away.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun was stunned. At that moment, he had a strong feeling that the monkey had become a wise old man. The vicissitudes in his eyes revealed that Bai Xiaochun felt that he could not read wrong.</p>
<p>In silence, he took out the jade slips and found the pill which he had recorded for the monkey to swallow, which was originally recorded as the elixir of the abandoned pill. At the moment, he focused on recording it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That pill I don&rsquo;t know about it! &quot; Bai Xiaochun was thoughtful, looking at the scattered figure, the eyes showed blessing, these small animals, because of him and change, he sincerely hope that they can live, live happily.</p>
<p>For a long time, Bai Xiaochun turned her wings and went back quickly.</p>
