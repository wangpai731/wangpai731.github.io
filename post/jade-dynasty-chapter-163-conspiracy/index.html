      <p>In the morning, the cool wind on Qingyun Mountain gently blows, turning the mist of a mountain slowly, like a gauze floating in the dense forest. Outside the ancestral hall of the three trigeminal Road, GUI Li, Mr. GUI and the old sweeper stand in a triangle, facing each other in a delicate atmosphere.</p>
<p>The wrinkles on the old man&rsquo;s face moved and his hoarse voice said slowly, &ldquo;you are not from Qingyun Mountain. Why are you here privately? What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at the old man for a moment. Mr. ghost stood six feet away from him. With their deeds, he might not be afraid of anyone in the world. However, between them, it was obvious that neither of them trusted each other.</p>
<p>However, at this moment, Mr. ghost&rsquo;s eyes hidden behind the black veil have been staring at the old man sweeping the floor. His eyes are bright, and it seems that he has another strange feeling.</p>
<p>The old man felt something. He turned around, looked at Mr. ghost, and said, &ldquo;this expert, you have been staring at the old man. Do you have anything to say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. GUI suddenly gave a smile and said, &ldquo;you are just an old man guarding the ancestral hall of Qingyun Mountain. Why bother about your own business? At present, this young man&hellip;&rdquo; He pointed to the ghost and said, &ldquo;he has heard of the reputation of the moon enchanting cave in Qingyun Mountain for a long time. He wants to go in and have a look at it. Do you want to let him go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Standing in the distance, GUI Li suddenly snorted coldly and said, &ldquo;before going up the mountain, you and I had already agreed to let me enter the magic moon cave to attract the attention of Qingyun gate. You take the opportunity to sneak into the ancestral hall of Qingyun Mountain and destroy all the spiritual places of the ancestors of Qingyun gate. How can you get here and not go in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as Mr. ghost was smothered, he looked at the ghost with a solemn and serious expression. It is hard to believe that there is no such thing. Mr. ghost looked at him for a long time. He gave a bitter smile and shook his head slightly.</p>
<p>The old man took a look. He looked at Mr. GUI again. His face became colder, and the sharp light in his eyes gradually became bright. He said, &ldquo;it seems that no matter what. Both of you are hostile to Qingyun. It&rsquo;s just a place of green clouds, and I&rsquo;ve been guarding it for many years. If you want to wreak havoc here, you&rsquo;d better step over the old man&rsquo;s body. &quot;</p>
<p>He said so quietly, facing the two mysterious and strange characters in front of him. Slowly stand up straight.</p>
<p>In the early morning, among the dense forests in the mountains, the distant chirping of birds suddenly seemed to stop and disappear. Only the mist of the mountain was still floating around them.</p>
<p>Decades of life, it seems that also quietly flowing in the past in this silence, turned into fine lines of the corner of the eye.</p>
<p>Mr. ghost suddenly said, &ldquo;is your left hand OK?&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li and the old man were stunned at the same time. He didn&rsquo;t understand why Mr. GUI suddenly uttered this inexplicable remark. However, the old man was obviously shocked and fixed his eyes on Mr. ghost. I can&rsquo;t leave again.</p>
<p>In the early morning, in the mist, the old man gazed for a long time. Suddenly, he let out a long breath. His expression of astonishment gradually faded, and he said slowly, &ldquo;is it you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. ghost laughed and said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stopped for a moment and looked at the old man&rsquo;s face. Even in his voice, he suddenly felt some emotion and said: &ldquo;these years. Why are you so old? If you look like this, who knows you are the famous Qingyun gate ten thousand swords! &quot;</p>
<p>Hearing the words &ldquo;one thousand Swords&rdquo; in his ears, the old man&rsquo;s body suddenly trembled, as if these three words were like three sharp blades. A knife and a knife were stabbed in his heart, even his face was deeply engraved by the years, and at the moment, there appeared a look of excitement that had not been seen for a long time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten thousand swords, one thousand swords&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said the name in a low voice, with a complicated and painful look on his face.</p>
<p>Grimly frowned on one side. Wan Jianyi had heard of Wan Jianyi when he was a disciple of Qingyun sect many years ago. However, he never thought that the figure who had passed away for many years should still live in the world. What&rsquo;s more, he didn&rsquo;t expect that the peerless figure who made the disputes among the elders of Qingyun gate and Taoist Cangsong betrayed Qingyun became such a humble figure That&rsquo;s a bad old man.</p>
<p>The cold wind blowing, grazing three people&rsquo;s lapels, in this mountain mist like a dream like place, the past seems to reverberate here.</p>
<p>Until, that once Wan Jian Yi, once looked down on the world, but now the wrinkled old man, slowly raised his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poof,&rdquo; a slight sound came from his hands. At the same time, GUI Li and Mr. GUI looked at each other and saw fine dust falling down. The broken broom in Wan Jian&rsquo;s hands was crushed and scattered on the ground when he was in a state of agitation.</p>
<p>The mountain breeze blows away the powder of the ground. Wan Jian looks at what was in his hand a moment ago, but now it disappears. Then, he looked up at Mr. GUI and said, &ldquo;if it had not been for you, I would have been disabled. I have always remembered your kindness to me.</p>
<p>&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. GUI said, &ldquo;you and I were as good as before at first sight. In the northwest wilderness, there was the monk Puzhi&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Has been standing on the side of the ghost, suddenly the body a shock, eyes bright.</p>
<p>Mr. GUI and Na Wan Jian didn&rsquo;t notice the change of the ghost&rsquo;s expression. They continued: &ldquo;although the three of us are different, they always have a meeting. Now Puzhi has passed away for many years, and you have already stopped the news. Unexpectedly, you can still meet each other today, and it&rsquo;s worthwhile for me to come to Qingyun Mountain. &quot; The words are full of regret.</p>
<p>Wan Jian Yi&rsquo;s tense expression on his face gradually relaxed at the moment. He sighed and said, &ldquo;yes, I didn&rsquo;t think that I could see my old friend again Stop! &quot;</p>
<p>In the middle of his speech, his voice was suddenly in a hurry, and he stopped drinking. However, he turned around in silence and did not want to listen to the two people&rsquo;s involvement in the past. He was about to go to the magic moon cave.</p>
<p>When Wan Jian snorted coldly, he could not see how his body swayed. He only raised his hand. Suddenly, his dry palm suddenly seemed to grow bigger and longer, and he grabbed it from behind like a giant claw.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the shadow of Tai Chi. It&rsquo;s the shadow of Tai Chi. Wan Jian&rsquo;s huge claw was held by Qingguang, and he was immediately shocked back. But only for a moment, Wan Jian Yi&rsquo;s dry body had been blocked in front of the ghost&rsquo;s body, but his face reappeared with a startled expression and said: &ldquo;is Taiji Xuanqing Dao? Who the hell are you? &quot;</p>
<p>The voice of Mr. GUI came from behind, saying, &ldquo;he is a great man in the ghost King sect of the demon sect today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost frowned. But still did not speak.</p>
<p>As soon as Wan Jian looked at him, he nodded and said, &ldquo;are you Zhang Xiaofan, who was expelled from the Mountain Gate by Qingyun gate ten years ago and joined the demon cult?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His face was as cold as frost. &ldquo;Get out of the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wan Jianyi didn&rsquo;t mean to get out of the way, but after a moment&rsquo;s observation, he suddenly sighed and said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s amazing that younger martial brother Tian can teach you such a disciple.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a look on his face. But then he snorted, and there was a sense of arrogance on his face. He looked at the famous ten thousand swords as if he had nothing. Wan Jian stood up straight with his hands down, but he didn&rsquo;t mean to retreat.</p>
<p>Seeing them getting closer and closer, Wan Jian suddenly frowned and rose from the ground. Almost at the same time, there was a dull sound on the ground under his feet. In an instant, the tortoise split open, and the soul devouring soul shining with cold blue and black light suddenly shot out of the land under his feet and went straight after him.</p>
<p>Wan Jian was in the middle of the air. He swayed his body and suddenly gave a big drink. He shook his left and right sides. He even grabbed the flying Soul Eater with his bare hands. The blood sucking beads on the top of the soul swallowing for a moment are full of red, and all the dark red blood threads are lit up, mixed in the black light, without hesitation. Straight away.</p>
<p>The black air rolled and the red light flashed. All around seemed to be dark in a moment, but wan Jian rushed down. All the sharp breath seemed to have no effect on him. It is the first time for him to see such figures.</p>
<p>Seeing that Wan Jian was about to grasp the evil things in the world, he was suddenly in the black and red light, on the top of the soul eating blood bead surface. Suddenly, a strange pattern emerges from the deep of the bead. It grows bigger from childhood, and becomes brighter from the dark. It stands out from the dark light in a moment. The golden light is brilliant. It is exactly the word &ldquo;Ku&rdquo; of Buddhism. It is full of pure and pure power, but it is mixed with a bit of strangeness. Shengsheng shakes back the palm of wanjianyi.</p>
<p>Wan Jianyi and GUI Li retreat at the same time, and the magic weapon in the Air flies back to Gui Li&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>Wan Jian stopped in the air, his face pale, staring at the ghost, word by word: &ldquo;Da Fan Prajna!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His face was grim and expressionless, but he was shocked in his heart. In the past ten years, it was the first time that he saw someone who could resist the power of soul eating demons empty handed.</p>
<p>He was shocked in his heart, but he didn&rsquo;t know that Wan Jian was surprised. Wan Jianyi himself was an extraordinary figure with extraordinary talent and splendor at that time. His Taoist deeds were far better than those of his peers. Besides a Taoist immortal who could be compared with him, he did not pay attention to other characters. Later, although he was tired of misfortune and had a rough fate, today, facing this younger generation, his innate pride still remains the same.</p>
<p>However, he was surprised by the fight with GUI Li. Although he was not in a bad condition, he was still affected by his blood essence. After that, the great Brahman Prajna, the true dharma of Buddhism, was integrated with the Taoist Dharma of demon sect. There was no gap between them. Even he had nothing to do with his accomplishments. He was forced to go back and was shocked.</p>
<p>The cold wind whizzed, blowing from the field, the mist gently drifting, has begun to have the appearance of dispersing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think of a person who can&rsquo;t wait for a long time to meet a ghost, but I can&rsquo;t think of it as a talent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li frowned and didn&rsquo;t quite understand the meaning of Wan Jian. However, Mr. ghost stood behind, but he sighed in a low voice. It seemed that he was also lamenting his old friend for many years. His rebellious ambition still remained unchanged. But that is when he sighs, he has a twinkle in his eyes and stares at Wan Jianyi&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get out of the way,&rdquo; he said coldly</p>
<p>When Wan Jian looked at him, the young man was indifferent and arrogant in front of him. Suddenly, his expression was so familiar. He burst out laughing suddenly. His expression was so sad, but then he was occupied by a feeling of pride. He said with a long smile: &ldquo;good, good, good. It&rsquo;s really a young man. People in the world should not look at it! But if you want to pass, you can use your real skills. &quot;</p>
<p>With a long howl, not to mention much, he jumped up. Wan Jian&rsquo;s pupil shrank and suddenly retreated. He flew to the edge of the forest. With his right hand, he grasped a pine tree of the size of one person and drank loudly. In an instant, his surroundings vibrated and rumbled. The huge pine trees were uprooted by him, like a giant arm in the air.</p>
<p>Wan Jian is holding a giant tree in his hand at the moment, standing aloof in the air. Where does he have the slightest trace of wretched stooping appearance? Look at his high spirits. His face was excited and his eyebrows were open, which was exactly what he looked like at that time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; said Wan Jian with a big drink, like thunder. &ldquo;If you have blood sucking beads, how about my giant green cloud tree?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His body swayed, and the giant tree danced in an instant. In a flash, the sound of &ldquo;Wuwu&rdquo; was extremely fast. The sky was covered with shadows of trees, and the wind was so strong that no other sound could be heard.</p>
<p>His face changed greatly and he tossed in the shadow of the tree. The huge tree storm is like a surging wave, like an endless tide, one after another, a wave higher than another, chasing under the blue sky, a mountain mist seems to tremble.</p>
<p>When the wind passes through the forest tops, it turns into a strong wind and turns into a whirlpool in the mid air, swallowing all things in the world, and the ghost is in the center of the whirlpool. All around are shadows of trees. The strong wind blows like a knife. It seems that if one is not careful, it will be cut into pieces by this sharp object.</p>
<p>Wan Jian laughs wildly.</p>
<p>It seems to be back to the years that once dominated the world. The expression on his face was more excited and concentrated on the ghost. In the storm, the ghost suddenly bit his teeth and saw the shadow of the trees in front of him like a mountain, but he didn&rsquo;t dodge this time. When the right hand is lifted up, the soul swallowing glows with dark red light. With a sound of &ldquo;puff&rdquo; in the shadow of tens of thousands of trees, it is nailed on the tree body accurately. In a moment, the Demon power dances wildly, and the red light rises from the blood sucking beads and twines around the tree trunk. Where it passes, the trunk bursts and the debris flies.</p>
<p>In a moment, one third of the trunk of the giant tree had been eaten away by this demon force. However, Wan Jian&rsquo;s face did not startle but laughed. With a long smile, he cut his left hand across the sky. The tree trunk was swept by the invisible strong wind and was cut off like tofu. Covered by the red awn of the tree trunk, in a blink of an eye, like a * *, turned into powder, scattered in the wind.</p>
<p>But the ten thousand sword in front of him lifted up the remnant tree trunk, which was as powerful as the sky. All over the sky, the shadow of the trees disappeared, the storm stopped, the strong wind stopped, everything in the world stopped breathing, all were staring at the figure flying in the air!</p>
<p>He came down from the sky, and with a loud shout, he lifted a log and blasted it down.</p>
<p>The strong wind was howling and piercing. On the ground three feet away, all the sand and stones flew out in an instant. There was only a ghostly man with a fierce skirt and a pale face, staring at the huge trees falling in the sky.</p>
<p>The sound of that strange roar is like thunder. In a twinkling of an eye, the ghost&rsquo;s sharp teeth clenched and his hands suddenly danced. The Taiji diagram turned incessantly, and rose abruptly on top of his head, blocking the tree trunk like thunder.</p>
<p>The two forces collided in the air, and even the land and mountain around them seemed to be shaken by it. The ground at the foot of the ghostly standing feet had fallen into the soil.</p>
<p>In front of the tree trunk, it was forced by the Taiji Xuanqing road. All of them burst, and the sawdust flew in disorder. In the twinkling of an eye, it turned into powder and disappeared everywhere. But then the trunk of the tree suddenly forced down, from the twinkling green Taiji pattern of a point stab. GUI Li&rsquo;s face turned white again, and the ghost eating demon was more prosperous. Buddhist mantra reappeared. Just below the Taiji pattern, the golden light flashed and spread another layer.</p>
<p>The strong wind was howling, and the field was almost breathless. The two men were fighting against each other in the green mountains and dense forests. No one could see his face, but the dark shadow flickered faintly.</p>
<p>Wan Jian&rsquo;s face was excited. It seemed that even the deep wrinkles had disappeared at the moment. It seemed that the youth years ago had come back to him at this time.</p>
<p>That once excited, proud of the world time!</p>
<p>He looked up to the sky and roared, like a dragon chanting in the sun. The strong wind on his face felt like the whole body&rsquo;s blood was burning!</p>
<p>He rushed down with a laugh, and his whole practice burst out on the tree trunk. All his practice in his life was like a flame.</p>
<p>Buddhism&rsquo;s true words disappear in an instant!</p>
<p>Layers of heavy pressure, like mountains and seas of general pressure, blood flow out of the corner of the mouth, pale face suddenly emerged in the flush, suddenly a mouthful of blood gushed, sprinkled on the soul devouring.</p>
<p>Drops of blood, quietly melt among them, the cold breath, from the deep heart echo away.</p>
<p>His eyes turned red with blood!</p>
<p>At this critical moment, suddenly, the wind that was howling all over the sky stopped, and the killing intention of God, ghost, and sorrow disappeared. Suddenly, the powerful figure like a God in the sky suddenly began to shake and gradually became weak.</p>
<p>A dark shadow quickly swept away from Wan Jianyi&rsquo;s back, but the long-standing Dharma lost its suppression and burst out immediately. The blue light and golden light, the dark red demon power, and the power of the three dharmas, which were integrated into one, rose against the sky and hit Wan Jianyi&rsquo;s chest firmly. In an instant, the sound of bone breaking broke like falling beads. As soon as Wan Jian stopped in the air, he didn&rsquo;t fly out, but his body suddenly became so soft. Starting from his chest, his muscles seemed to lose support and began to atrophy irreparably.</p>
<p>The ghost Li was stunned. At the next moment, he could not help holding Wan Jianyi&rsquo;s body. In the beginning, the old body told him again that he was such an old man. When he flipped, he clearly saw that there was a black palm print on the back of wanjianyi.</p>
<p>As soon as he fell to the ground, he and WAN Jian, who was panting, turned their heads and looked at the dark shadow standing in the mist that was about to disperse, and it was Mr. ghost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; he said coldly</p>
<p>Mr. ghost did not pay attention to him, but looked at Wan Jianyi. The dying old man was also staring at him. However, the expression in his eyes was much more complicated.</p>
<p>The black veil on Mr. ghost&rsquo;s face was fluttering gently. I don&rsquo;t know if he was also agitated, but his voice was still so insipid: &ldquo;after so many years, are you still like this? Don&rsquo;t you always believe in your friends, don&rsquo;t you worry? &quot;</p>
<p>Wan Jian opened his mouth and seemed to want to say something, but when he opened his mouth, his mouth was full of blood. His face is rapidly pale, as if life is also quietly away from him.</p>
<p>Then, he is a light smile, in the blood and bitterness, a faint smile, turn his head, looking at the ghost.</p>
<p>That look, at the moment, I don&rsquo;t know how, but a bit soft.</p>
<p>He breathed deeply and suddenly his eyes were hot. The old man who was still fighting for life and death at the moment did not dare to look at each other. He put down the old man in silence, stood up and whispered, &ldquo;if you have a dragon sword in your hand, I will not be your opponent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wan Jian looked at the young man. His hands were tightly clasped and his body seemed to be shaking slightly. Then, ghost Li turned around and stared at Mr. ghost. Mr. ghost didn&rsquo;t evade his eyes, and he didn&rsquo;t seem to care about the disdain and disgust in his eyes.</p>
<p>GUI Li stares at him silently for a while. Then, without speaking, he turns his head and walks into the mountain road of the magic moon cave, and soon his figure disappears.</p>
<p>There were only two people left in the field.</p>
<p>Mr. ghost slowly walked to Wan Jianyi&rsquo;s side. The powerless old man lay on the ground, slowly raised his eyes, looked at him, from the corner of his mouth is still gushing blood.</p>
