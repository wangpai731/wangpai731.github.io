      <p>Like the passage of the netherworld, a huge whirlpool of dark and invisible bottom hangs upside down in the sky, like the nine hell demons opening their horrible mouths to devour everything in the world. The wind is strong, and the clouds are whirling. Thunder rumbled, electricity darted.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan deceiving himself to fly in, the dark light of the fire staff flickers, which is noticeable under the dark clouds. Lu Xueqi looks at Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s figure in the green light, and her jade face is white.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The true secret of magic sword against thunder&rdquo; is the most marvelous skill of Taoist immortal method. It can be imagined that Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s body is under great pressure at the moment when he causes the heaven and the earth to be so awesome with his mortal body. &ldquo;Tianya&rdquo; is an immortal magic weapon. It was originally a good weapon to use the magic sword to resist thunder. But compared with it, Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s Taoist practice was insufficient.</p>
<p>At the moment, she only felt that in the dark clouds of the sky, infinite power was pouring into her body like surging waves. It seemed that there was no change in the whole body, but the blood in her body was almost broken by this great force. If it wasn&rsquo;t for Tianya to absorb the surging force, Lu Xueqi would not have been able to support her for a long time.</p>
<p>The wind roared and thunder roared. She stood up in the air. In a trance, she almost thought that she was like a weak grass in the wind. Next moment, she remembered the words of master Shuiyue passing on her magic skill: &ldquo;Xueqi, you have the best qualification, which is the only one I&rsquo;ve seen in my life, but the true formula is too powerful, so the power of counter eating is even more inescapable. The day of your cultivation is still shallow. Although you can barely master it, you must not practice at will to avoid the disaster of extinction. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boom!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A thunder, almost from the top of Tongtian peak to the sky, everyone faintly felt that the ground under his feet shook slightly, as if the ancient god of thunder was disturbed and fell asleep, roaring furiously!</p>
<p>Everyone changes color at one time!</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan is only two Zhangs away from Lu Xueqi at the moment. After seeing this power, everyone knows that once Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s practice is completed, he will be annihilated for fear. But all of a sudden he was so tight that he stopped as if he had hit a soft wall and could not move forward.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s face was dead in an instant. &ldquo;The true secret of magic sword against thunder&rdquo; is one of the wonders of Qingyun gate. How marvelous is it? During the process of casting, Zhang Xiaofan can&rsquo;t enter it because the magic soldiers naturally put a layer of invisible shield around the caster.</p>
<p>The staff is more brilliant, but it can&rsquo;t move forward any more.</p>
<p>Maybe in the power of spirit, Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s fire staff is not inferior to Tianya, but in the skill, it&rsquo;s too far away. He just uses his own spirit to urge the fire staff to have a fever, which is definitely not comparable to Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s unique skill, which has been practiced by generations of ancestors of Qingyun sect for thousands of years.</p>
<p>But at this moment of desperation, seeing the huge whirlpool in the sky rotating faster, thunder and lightning making, the light of Tianya divine sword is more and more bright, this peerless immortal method is about to be completed, Lu Xueqi suddenly shakes, her originally white face turns red instantly, and &ldquo;wow&rdquo; spews out a big mouth of blood, almost becoming a blood mist in front of her.</p>
<p>When Tianya divine sword appeared, it seemed that it was unsteady. Lu Xueqi clenched her silver teeth, closed her eyes, and concentrated all her heart and spirit on Tianya. After a while, the light of Tianya stabilized, but it was more brilliant than before, and could not be forced to look.</p>
<p>There was a loud noise in the dark cloud, and there seemed to be a bright light in the deepest part of the huge whirlpool. It was a myriad of lightning converging into one, which was faintly facing the Tianya sword in Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>However, Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s heart was a burst of despair. In the wind, there was a sharp roar indeed. She protects Tianya with all her strength, but she can&rsquo;t take care of her body guard any more. Zhang Xiaofan is so happy that he and the fire staff turn into a dark and green light column, cross the sky, and rush to the beautiful woman who sways in the wind.</p>
<p>Is that it?</p>
<p>Is it all up here?</p>
<p>Her mind suddenly calmed down, thinking so lightly in that moment.</p>
<p>This moment, a short moment, the world is quiet, frozen, all things are fixed there, only she stood in the wind, clothes fluttering, black hair blowing, opened the closed eyes, looking at the way ahead of the blue light.</p>
<p>That moment seems eternal!</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan saw her, and her eyes!</p>
<p>She stood alone in the wind and rain, but she was so peaceful in the face of the great power of heaven and earth, but her face was slightly pale, and there was a sadness and a sense of panic in her eyes.</p>
<p>Wind and rain howl, desolate world, this beautiful woman, and he quietly look at each other.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s eyes, sad and so desolate, as if last night, that man was hurt by feelings! That kind of pain, deeply into the bone marrow, deeply into the soul.</p>
<p>Deep! deeply!</p>
<p>Is it you, the woman who loves others?</p>
<p>Do you think of him all your life without regret?</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan suddenly smiled, with a point of sadness and heart death, as if last night.</p>
<p>The fire staff melted into the light of the God sword of Tianya. No one could see them any more, and the light of the fire staff suddenly faded. At this moment, the sky is loud, and a huge electric pole falls from the sky to the sky.</p>
<p>The whole heaven and earth, full of gods and Buddhas, seem to sing together at the same time.</p>
<p>The huge light column refracted from Tianya, took the momentum of destroying the sky and destroying the earth, and rushed to Zhang Xiaofan. At the critical moment of life and death, the fire stick rose up in the air and blocked in front of the master.</p>
<p>Next moment, Zhang Xiaofan is swallowed by the light.</p>
<p>Long time! Long time! Long time!</p>
<p>The sky is black and the light is gone.</p>
<p>People stared at the sky, looked at the young man, tightly holding a black fire stick, like a stone suffering from all kinds of scars, and fell straight down.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t fall to the ground. Tian was not easy to appear under him like a ghost and caught him. Seeing that Tian was not easy to be dignified, he immediately broke Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s unconscious mouth and took out a small bottle from his arms. No matter how much, he poured the yellow pill directly into Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s mouth.</p>
<p>The entrance of the pill was instant, and Tian could not easily keep silent. He got up and immediately raised a red light, which drove him away in a hurry. He stopped looking at the field. Looking in that direction, he went back to Dazhu peak.</p>
<p>Su Ru and other people in dazhufeng also followed.</p>
<p>At this time, Lu Xueqi, who was pale, fell down and was immediately surrounded by the ecstatic people of xiaozhufeng. Surrounded by her teachers and sisters, she raised her head without saying a word and looked at the red light disappearing from the sky. She was speechless.</p>
<p>　　※※※</p>
<p>He seems to be sleeping in the dark for thousands of years, eager to wake up but unable to open his eyes. In the deep and boundless darkness, he is alone.</p>
<p>But he would never walk alone in the darkness, but there was no way to go except the darkness.</p>
<p>So he was sad and indignant, and deeply felt that there was a burning fire, so he swore to the nine Ghosts: even if his body and soul were turned into ashes together, he would light up this light, even if he buried all the things in the world together.</p>
<p>Since ancient times, that trace of violence has been as rebellious as ever!</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan slowly opened his eyes.</p>
<p>The soft light came into his eyes, and the familiar taste of the house floated in the room.</p>
<p>No one seems to be here.</p>
<p>He slowly sat up, just want to lift his hand to wipe off a little sweat on his forehead, then he only felt a sharp pain in his shoulder, chest and abdomen. At that time, he took a breath of cool air and turned white with pain.</p>
<p>He sat on the bed, dare not move again, after a long time, the pain slowly dissipated.</p>
<p>At this time, it&rsquo;s afternoon. The door of the room is open, and two windows are set up. You can see the green grass and bamboo in the courtyard. The little grey who has always followed him and the rhubarb who has always followed him are gone. Will they find the flesh and bones again?</p>
<p>He smiled at the empty room and smiled at himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Squeak!&rdquo; the door opened, and Su Ru came in. Zhang Xiaofan moved and called &ldquo;teacher&rsquo;s mother&rdquo;. Before he got up, his face began to twitch again.</p>
<p>Su Ru quickly walked to the bedside and sat down. In a soft voice, she said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t move, Xiao Fan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan waited for the pain to subside, and then said to Su Ru, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know that you came&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru took a look at him and said, &ldquo;most of your life has gone, but you still have the mind to remember this! Stop talking nonsense and sit down. &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan smiles, Su Ru checks for him, nods and says, &ldquo;your injury is almost as good as before, but the damage of meridians and collaterals in your body is too serious, so it&rsquo;s impossible to rest uneasily.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan said, &ldquo;yes, I have disgraced Shifu and Shiniang. That&rsquo;s right&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru cut off: &ldquo;you have made a big face for your master. In the past three hundred years, there is no better disciple in dazhufeng than you except for the seven pulse meeting in which your master participated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan blushed and bowed his head and said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s all good luck for the disciples.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru smiled and patted him on the shoulder. Zhang Xiaofan immediately thought of it, and said, &ldquo;is the contest over? Who won the championship in the end? Is that elder martial sister Lu?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru shook her head slightly and said, &ldquo;no, it&rsquo;s Qi Hao from dragon head peak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan didn&rsquo;t know why. Suddenly, he felt sad and said in a low voice, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s elder martial brother Qi. He&rsquo;s really powerful. Even elder martial sister Lu, who owns Tianya, was defeated by him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru seemed to be touched by what he said. She sighed low and said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve been hurt badly this time. Your master took great pains to cure you. Listen to him. Use the magic sword of Tianya to resist thunder. Although Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s practice is not enough, if it&rsquo;s not for you to burn or burn&hellip; Your magic weapon will stop you, even if it&rsquo;s not for the immortals It&rsquo;s back to the sky. &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan listened to her words, and suddenly remembered that, looking around, he couldn&rsquo;t find the black ugly fire stick.</p>
<p>Su Ru looked at him and said lightly, &ldquo;your magic weapon has been taken by your master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan said in a low voice, &ldquo;yes.&rdquo; Then he couldn&rsquo;t help asking again, &ldquo;master, he is an old man&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru said: &ldquo;you have been in a coma for five days and five nights, and the injury was not stable until last night. This morning, the head elder martial brother of tongtianfeng sent a letter to ask your master to go to tongtianfeng. You should be in tongtianfeng now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan nodded slowly. He didn&rsquo;t know what it was like. He thought it should be OK. But for the first time in the past two years, the fire stick left him, but he always felt a little lost.</p>
<p>Su Ru took a look at him, as if there was a strange look in her eyes, but she said: &ldquo;you just woke up, don&rsquo;t be too tired, and have a lot of rest. I have told them not to disturb you. I will send you the three meals</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan said, &ldquo;thank you very much, Shiniang.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru nodded and said, &ldquo;then you have a rest. I&rsquo;ll ask Bing Shu to deliver the food later.&rdquo; Then she turned back and walked out. Just as she was about to walk out of the door, she suddenly heard Zhang Xiaofan shouting behind her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shiniang.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru turned around and said, &ldquo;what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan looked at her as if he hesitated for a moment, and then said, &ldquo;I want to ask you, teacher, what&rsquo;s the result of the contest of Lin Jingyu of longshoufeng? At that time, when I was on Tongtian peak, I really had no time to ask him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru looked at him again and said, &ldquo;he was in the top eight, but he was defeated by Qi Hao, his senior brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was stunned for a moment and said, &ldquo;he, too&hellip; Thank you, Shiniang.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru shook her head slightly and said, &ldquo;you have a rest.&rdquo; Then he turned and walked out.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan slowly lay down, looking at the ceiling of the room, silent.</p>
<p>　　※※※</p>
<p>Qingyun Mountain is on the top of Tianfeng mountain, in Yuqing palace.</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan is sitting in the middle, and the other six vessels are also sitting in the center. In addition, there is no one else above the hall.</p>
<p>Everyone was silent. Immortal daoxuan lowered his eyebrows and looked at a black fire stick he was playing with.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Younger martial brother Tian,&rdquo; immortal daoxuan broke the silence and said, &ldquo;what do you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian was not easy to keep silent for a moment and said, &ldquo;Zhang Xiaofan didn&rsquo;t have this thing at the beginning of his ascent. Most of the time, it was a coincidence in these years. Where did he accidentally get this treasure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taoist Cangsong said coldly: &ldquo;this staff can fight against Tianya. It&rsquo;s a divine soldier. But when you look around the world, you&rsquo;ve never heard of such treasures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian is not easy to face a heavy, cold way: &ldquo;Shenzhou HaoTu, how vast, do not know how many rare treasures, you and I at best is just a frog at the bottom of the well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taoist Cangsong&rsquo;s face was glowing, but he heard master Shuiyue of xiaozhufeng say coldly: &ldquo;we are naturally frogs at the bottom of the well, but when this black stick is used, it&rsquo;s very dangerous. I don&rsquo;t know why elder martial brother Tian can&rsquo;t see it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian not easy to hum a, way: &ldquo;send some black gas is evil gas?&rdquo;? Are some red silk evil things? If so, I&rsquo;ll go back and blacken my face. Do you think I&rsquo;ve been beheaded as a demon demon? &quot;</p>
<p>Taoist Xuan frowned and said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t talk like that, Mr. Tian. How can you say that you are a demon demon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian is not easy to hum coldly. He turns away and stops talking.</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan sighed and put the fire stick in his hand on the tea table. He said: &ldquo;today, I&rsquo;d like to invite you to come here for a discussion. One of the seven pulse meeting is that Zhang Xiaofan, a disciple of dazhufeng, has this strange magic weapon in his hand. It&rsquo;s unknown and powerful. Two of the first four disciples of our discussion group went to the ancient cave of wanbat in kongsang mountain to investigate. The other three are all of you No problem, only Zhang Xiaofan&hellip;&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>Tian is not easy to hear. He is angry. He was confused about Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s sudden progress in practice. He was also suspicious of the fire staff. However, in the Yuqing hall, others didn&rsquo;t say anything, but he was critical of his disciples. How could he not be angry? He stood up calmly and said in a loud voice, &ldquo;what do you want to do, chief elder martial brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan didn&rsquo;t expect Tian not to have such a big reaction. He was surprised. Everyone looked sideways and sat beside him. Uncle Zeng, the first Feng Huifeng who had a good relationship with him, pulled Tian&rsquo;s sleeve. He said: &ldquo;no, the leader and senior brother didn&rsquo;t say anything. Sit down first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan&rsquo;s face was slightly heavy, and he said: &ldquo;younger martial brother Tian, it&rsquo;s really strange. I&rsquo;m the leader of a sect. I will deal with it fairly. You can rest assured.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian&rsquo;s face was still angry, but he sat down after looking at Taoist Xuan&rsquo;s face and Zeng Shuchang&rsquo;s advice.</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan said slowly: &ldquo;everyone, we have seen this staff just now. It looks flat and has no Qi, but there is evil Qi in it. But the most important thing is that we can&rsquo;t control this thing in our practice. On the contrary, what&rsquo;s the reason that only the fourth level disciples of Yuqing realm can use it? &quot;</p>
<p>Everyone including Tian is not easy to be silent. They are all first-class practitioners. How can they not know this truth? But no one is willing to say it.</p>
<p>Finally, daoxuanzhen said, &ldquo;in my opinion, most of the black staff is blood refining.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Despite the psychological preparation, the first one in this room changed his face slightly. The so-called blood refining thing is that people&rsquo;s blood essence is transformed into refining and building treasures. The methods are strange, difficult and dangerous. The material of the magic weapon is extremely harsh. There is no one in ten thousand. Moreover, the process of refining and building is extremely dangerous. If you are not careful, it will backfire for the blood and strength of the magic weapon. The death is too painful 。</p>
<p>Of course, if it can succeed, the magic weapon must be extremely powerful, and also has the advantage that the treasure is connected with the host&rsquo;s blood. Unless there is blood refining, no one else can use it. But also because it is blood, there is often evil spirit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s said that this blood refining method was passed down from ancient demons and gods. It has been passed down from generation to generation among demons of the demon sect since ancient times, but I haven&rsquo;t heard of any famous blood refining magic weapon. Most of the time, it&rsquo;s too dangerous for even demons to try it easily.</p>
<p>However, now there is such a magic weapon in a young disciple of Qingyun gate.</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan looked at Tian hard and Tian hard, and he stood up slowly. He said, &ldquo;elder martial brother, you may be right, but I still want to say that Zhang Xiaofan is no more than sixteen. How do you know the skill of blood refining? And he has never been down the mountain for five years since he went up. When he came here, he had no talent. Where can he find the magic material that is hard to find in the world? &quot;</p>
<p>Taoist Cangsong suddenly said coldly, &ldquo;maybe he is the one in the demon sect who put his heart into my Qingyun gate, which is not surprising!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian was not easy to get angry, and said: &ldquo;if he had such a plan, how could he drive this thing under the eyes of nearly a thousand people in the martial arts test of seven channels? What&rsquo;s more, if he is really the spy of the demon sect, hey, senior brother Cangsong, Lin Jingyu under your door is afraid that he is not clean! &quot;</p>
<p>Taoist Cangsong seems to have been stabbed to the pain. He gets up and says angrily, &ldquo;what do you say? How can Jingyu compare with your stupid apprentice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian was not easy to look darker. He snorted and squinted and said, &ldquo;yes, my apprentice is stupid, but I heard that he is still in the top four. I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s the rank of Lin Jingyu, the wizard under elder martial brother Cangsong&rsquo;s sect?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cang Song said angrily, &ldquo;he was unlucky. If he met his elder martial brother Qi Hao, how could he not be in the top four!&rdquo; Speaking of this, he sneered and said: &ldquo;anyway, he is not so lucky as someone else. All the way up, he can be promoted only by others abstaining from the rotation. How dare he speak up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian is not easy to say in a loud voice: &ldquo;is that also luck between him and Lu Xueqi?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taoist Cangsong said, &ldquo;yes, because it&rsquo;s not luck, so he lost, and he lost so miserably that he almost lost his life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian is not easy to get angry. His tongue is always inflexible. He can&rsquo;t speak of Cangsong, but he is more angry in his heart. His face is red. He says angrily, &ldquo;what do you want? Do you want to see if I have a false reputation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taoist Cangsong had no intention of backing away. He stood up immediately and said proudly, &ldquo;then I&rsquo;ll learn your red light immortal sword from elder martial brother Tian!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not easy for Tian not to speak. He steps on. His right hand has grasped the sword formula. The air on the hall suddenly seems to be solidified.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unbridled!&rdquo; There was a loud noise, but immortal daoxuan clapped his hand on the tea table and stood up with angry face. &ldquo;You two can&rsquo;t be dead when I&rsquo;m the leader!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Daoxuan has been on the throne of the leader for nearly three hundred years. He is highly respected and virtuous. Although he is amiable in ordinary times, Tian can&rsquo;t easily be surprised with Taoist Cangsong this time. His heart is shaken. He then retreats and whispers: &ldquo;yes, master, elder martial brother, please calm down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan looked at these first seats, and his face was angry for a long time before he slowly retreated. He pondered for a while and said: &ldquo;brother Tian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian was not easy to step out and said, &ldquo;senior brother, headmaster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan looked at him and said, &ldquo;in any case, this black stick has a strange origin. If it&rsquo;s really a thing of the demon sect, what&rsquo;s the connection between Zhang Xiaofan and the demon sect? We can&rsquo;t allow him. Do you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian is not easy to slightly bow, silent for a long time, just way: &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan said again: &ldquo;younger martial brother Tian, I know that you are not easy to suffer, but we should not act cautiously because of the trouble. You should go back today. When Zhang Xiaofan is in a better condition, you will cross examine him carefully, and then bring him here. We will discuss later. How about that? &quot;</p>
<p>Tian is not easy on the face white a burst of red, suddenly heavily Dun feet, nodded, not even a word, turned around and walked out.</p>
<p>There was a roar outside the door, most of which was the sword.</p>
<p>On the main hall, uncle Zeng often told daoxuanzhen, &ldquo;headmaster, elder martial brother, it&rsquo;s hard to find a talent in brother Tian&rsquo;s dazhufeng. However, he&rsquo;s not very happy about this. Don&rsquo;t worry about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan sighed and shook his head and said, &ldquo;naturally, I don&rsquo;t care. I know and I can believe that younger martial brother Tian is human.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Speaking of this, he seemed to think of something. Turning to master Shuiyue of xiaozhufeng, he said: &ldquo;sister Shuiyue, these days. That female disciple under your door, Lu Xueqi&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shuiyue said lightly: &ldquo;thank you, elder martial brother. Xueqi has recovered. If it wasn&rsquo;t for those strange people and treasures under brother Tian, Xueqi would not have lost half of her energy in a fight! &quot;</p>
<p>When Cangsong&rsquo;s face changed, immortal daoxuan shook his hand and said, &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s all over. Don&rsquo;t worry about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cangsong and Shuiyue stare at each other and turn their heads. Immortal daoxuan looks at each other and sighs in his heart. His eyes involuntarily move to the tea table beside him. He sees the black and ugly fire stick lying on the tea table.(to be continued. )</p>
