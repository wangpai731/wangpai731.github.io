      <p>After that terrible nonsense, I don&rsquo;t know whether Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s body was originally strong, or whether Biyao&rsquo;s comfort had an effect. The high fever that had been going on gradually subsided. Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s mind slowly recovered, and people were awake, but the illness was still not light, mostly lying down and resting.</p>
<p>On this day, Baguio wandered in the cave without any business. Finally, she went to the four sentences left by Mrs. Jinling and looked at them carefully. She couldn&rsquo;t help sighing. Zhang Xiaofan sat beside him and couldn&rsquo;t help asking, &ldquo;what do you sigh for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sighing for my wife. She&rsquo;s so talented and beautiful, but she&rsquo;s been let down by you smelly men. How unworthy of a miserable life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was dumb.</p>
<p>Biyao looked at these words carefully again, and suddenly &ldquo;eh&rdquo; made a sound, but found a strange place. The last word &ldquo;bitter&rdquo; in the last sentence of the four sentences, and the word &ldquo;mouth&rdquo; at the bottom was deeply sunk in, which was quite different from other words. When her eyes turned, she almost immediately responded, reaching out to pick up the joyous bell at her waist, and the size was just right, I can&rsquo;t help cheering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; said Zhang Xiaofan, surprised behind his back</p>
<p>Baguio turned to him and said with a smile, &ldquo;there is help!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan is surprised, immediately came to the spirit, happy way: &ldquo;seriously?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biyao inserts the bell, sees no reaction, and tries to turn left and right again. A moment later, suddenly, the sound of &ldquo;click&rdquo; in the cave rings, the stone wall vibrates, and Biyao is shocked. Holding the golden bell, she quickly backs up, only listens to the sound of &ldquo;boom&rdquo;. The originally smooth stone wall collapses one layer down, revealing one layer inside, and the upper side is engraved with words like the inner celestial script.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was pleased at first, but then he looked around the stone wall, but his face gradually became ugly. It seems that this mechanism is only set for Mrs. Jinling to cover the words on the stone wall, and there is no way out. This time, he was extremely depressed.</p>
<p>Biyao is staring at the words on the stone wall. The things left by Mrs. Jinling are so important. It must not be ordinary. After a long time, her face looked cloudy and sunny, but the color of exclamation was especially heavy, and she whispered: &ldquo;it turns out that this is the &lsquo;spoony Charm&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan is impatient. I came here to have a look, but the first few words are:</p>
<p>Nine hell spirits, gods and demons,</p>
<p>Sacrifice my blood.</p>
<p>Three lives seven. I will never die,</p>
<p>Only for the sake of love, though dead, do not regret.</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>As soon as he saw it, he knew that it was a vicious spell in the evil way. But when he saw Baguio&rsquo;s face, he was mostly happy. He could not help humming, &ldquo;is there any way out here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as Baguio stayed, she said, &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan said lightly, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the use of your learning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know the origin of this infatuation charm. It has been handed down from ancient times in our holy religion. But it&rsquo;s said that no one has ever wanted to use it? &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan listened, but was curious, said: &ldquo;how?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biyao sighed and said: &ldquo;the legend of this incantation was learned by an intelligent female founder from the book of heaven, but it can only be practiced by women. It&rsquo;s said that it&rsquo;s based on women&rsquo;s blood essence and turned into a fierce incantation, which is extremely powerful&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before she had finished speaking, Zhang Xiaofan had interrupted her, and her eyes were full of contempt. &ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s called&rdquo; fierce blood curse &ldquo;. Well, what else is the infatuation curse? It&rsquo;s evil. It&rsquo;s elegant!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biyao&rsquo;s face changed. But then he said in a low voice, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re right. It&rsquo;s just like Mrs. Jinling&rsquo;s old lady. It&rsquo;s useless in the end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan ignored her.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>After a few more days here, Zhang Xiaofan went to see the book of heaven in his spare time, while Biyao often stared at the words on the stone wall that she called the charm of infatuation.</p>
<p>In the first volume of the book of heaven. In fact, there is no practical cultivation method. The whole article is hard and profound, which can be regarded as the general principle. However, Zhang Xiaofan learned the two dharmas of Buddhism and Taoism. He can understand this passage, but only understand it. Zhang Xiaofan is still puzzled about the state of the integration of Buddhism and Taoism in the book of heaven. Does it mean that the two truths of &ldquo;taijixuanqingdao&rdquo; and &ldquo;Dafan Prajna&rdquo; should be combined and applied at the same time?</p>
<p>Although he knew that there was little hope for survival, there were always some temptations in his mind. Zhang Xiaofan soon tried to cultivate in the direction mentioned in the book of heaven. But it was not easy to use these two truths at the same time. In a moment, his blood was surging and he had to stop decadent. In the next few days, there was no progress at all.</p>
<p>But then came the bigger problem for both of them: there was no food.</p>
<p>Although the man who cultivates the Tao can go to the sea, he is also born with the body. It is said that the senior generation who practiced the profound Taoism practiced the skill of digging up the valley without drinking or eating, but no one has ever seen him.</p>
<p>After entering the cave, Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s dry food has been lost. Although fortunately there is still water to drink in the cave, only Biyao can bring the dry food. Where can we eat it? Even if they save time and again, they will soon finish eating.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know how long I have been in the cave. I&rsquo;m afraid that in two days, Zhang Xiaofan and Bi Yao are dazed by the empty food bag.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; Biyao sits on the platform, next to the pile of dead bones, but there is no discomfort. It seems that the women of the demon sect are different from ordinary people. But now, she is a sad face.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s condition is very good. His fever has subsided almost. Apart from his weakness, he is not in any serious trouble. At this time, he heard Bagao sighing and turned to look at the woman of the demon sect. In his eyes, it was the woman in the water green clothes who was sitting on the edge of the platform, with her feet in the air, shaking for a while, and the joyous bell &ldquo;jingling&rdquo; in her waist. If not in this environment and knowing her identity, Zhang Xiaofan would almost think that she was a virgin girl.</p>
<p>But looking at it like this, Biyao is more haggard than when she met. Her daughter&rsquo;s house still washes and combs the little water curtain every day, so she still looks beautiful and doesn&rsquo;t feel dirty. But these days, she is obviously emaciated. Thinking of this, Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s heart moved. From an hour on, he listened to the instructions of his senior brothers. All the people in the evil way were selfish and hated being hot. But now in the cave Jedi, why would this demon sect woman divide the only food into half for herself?</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan thought about it and didn&rsquo;t notice that Biyao looked over. See Zhang Xiaofan don&rsquo;t know when to begin to stare at oneself stupidly, on the face suddenly a red, hateful way: &ldquo;what do you see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was startled and turned away. &ldquo;No, nothing,&rdquo; she said</p>
<p>After him, Biyao didn&rsquo;t yell at him as loudly as he thought. For a long time, however, a sigh came from him and said, &ldquo;we are trapped in the cave. Not far from death, you don&rsquo;t have to be so restrained. &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan froze for a moment, slowly turned around, looked at Biyao, saw her thin but still beautiful face, a faint helpless smile, could not help rushing out: &ldquo;in fact, when I was seriously ill, you don&rsquo;t have to give me most of the dry food, so you can also live for a few days, maybe&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or what?&rdquo; Biyao suddenly interrupts him.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was stunned. Shaking his head and whispering, &ldquo;maybe you can be saved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biyao shook her head slightly, smiled a little, and said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to die, but I don&rsquo;t want to wait for a skeleton and another rotting corpse in the stillness of this cave. In that case, I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m going crazy before someone comes to save me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan could not help shivering when he heard what she described. It&rsquo;s not really a human life.</p>
<p>Biyao glanced at him and said lightly, &ldquo;why, are you afraid too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan immediately straightened his back and said in a loud voice, &ldquo;no way!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a smile on the corner of Bagao&rsquo;s mouth. Looking at him in the eyes gradually had a trace if have if have if not gentle, soft voice way: &ldquo;you promise me a thing, OK?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan frowned and said, &ldquo;what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a faint smile, Biyao said: &ldquo;we have finished all our dry food now, and there is nothing to eat except some clear water. I&rsquo;m afraid that within seven days, I will starve to death. &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan is silent.</p>
<p>Biyao&rsquo;s face was calm, but what he said next made Zhang Xiaofan look like a ghost and lose his face: &ldquo;in a few days, if you see that I can&rsquo;t do it, kill me first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan opened his mouth and pointed to her, but she couldn&rsquo;t speak for a while. Unexpectedly, Biyao still said strange and shocking words calmly: &ldquo;after I died, the body is still there. If you want to survive, you will eat my flesh, and probably live for a long time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan almost fell to the ground.</p>
<p>After a long time, he came back from this great shock, and immediately said to himself in his heart, &ldquo;the people of this demon sect are really all evils, and even these things can be done!&rdquo; But looking at the face of Biyao, she was calm, and her heart was even colder. She could not help but step back, pointing to her fingers, she almost trembled, and said, &ldquo;what do you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Biyao looked at her, the tenderness in her eyes seemed to be stronger, but in Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s eyes, it seemed to be more poisonous than all the poisons in the world combined.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want to go back to Dazhu peak of Qingyun Mountain to see your elder martial sister ling&rsquo;er? There are several of your classmates in the wanbat ancient cave. They will come to you. The longer you live, the more hope they will find you?&rdquo; Biyao lowered her head slightly, but her voice was still so flat.</p>
<p>But Zhang Xiaofan didn&rsquo;t even notice how she knew about elder martial sister ling&rsquo;er. He just pointed at her and said angrily, &ldquo;you, you actually told me to eat, eat, eat You devils are unreasonable! Shameless, disgusting, I, I You, you&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>The more he said it, the angrier he became, but he didn&rsquo;t have a good sense between his mouth and tongue. He said &ldquo;I, I, I, I, you and you&rdquo; for a long time, but he didn&rsquo;t say anything. However, his reaction seems to have been in Bagao&rsquo;s imagination. She was not angry or sarcastic. She just stared at him for a long time. When Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s gasping breath gradually calmed down, she slowly said: &ldquo;eat me or not, it&rsquo;s up to you, but you must kill me first!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Again.&rdquo; Zhang Xiaofan said angrily, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t want me to join you. You give me some dry food, and I will use this body to return you. If you want to pull me into the water, you can&rsquo;t break it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; said Biyao, shaking her head slowly</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan habitually said: &ldquo;nonsense, I will never be fooled by you Eh, what do you say? &quot;</p>
<p>It seems that at this critical moment of life and death, Biyao&rsquo;s mood has changed unprecedentedly. She seems to have fallen into some kind of memory, and a kind of fear that Zhang Xiaofan never saw in her face emerges. Then, she shakes her head heavily, as if she wants to get rid of any idea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know what it&rsquo;s like to die alone. What is it like? &quot; She whispered.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was stunned for a while, and found that she seemed to have another secret feeling and was curious. &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The muscles in the corner of her eyes seemed to twitch. In the face of death, she could not control her feelings and even her voice when facing the only youth who accompanied her in front of death. There is also a trace of obscurity and Emptiness: &ldquo;when I was six years old, my mother took me back to&rdquo; six fox caves in huqishan &ldquo;to see my grandma. Unexpectedly, at that time, you were going to attack. Among them, the common evil monk of&rdquo; Tianyin Temple &ldquo;used the magic weapon&rdquo; pagoda golden bowl &ldquo;to collapse the whole six fox cave, and Sheng Sheng buried me, my mother and my grandmother alive under the ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s body suddenly shakes for a while, a trace of bad premonition, even a kind of cold, from his heart, from the top to the bottom of his feet.</p>
<p>At this moment, it seems that Biyao has been completely immersed in painful memories, and her eyes are looking straight ahead. Empty and hollow, just like her tone of voice, plain and empty, with the deepest pain: &ldquo;at that time, I was scared to wail, scared to death. It&rsquo;s a small cave, because there are several big stones to support us, we can survive, but grandma was seriously injured and died soon. My mother took me to cry in the dark. Just bury grandma. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were buried deep in the ground. Except for a few drops of water between the rocks, we were surrounded by a hard and cold rock. I was scared, but my mother always told me that Xiaoyao was not afraid. Dad will come to save us. &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan now held his breath and listened carefully, with a trace of unspeakable strangeness and hidden fear, as if he felt something was about to happen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s always dark here. My father never came. I was afraid in the dark hole, hungry and crying. I still remember, my mother sighed beside me, hugged me tightly in her arms, and kept saying to me: Xiaoyao is not afraid, Xiaoyao is not afraid, your mother will not let you have anything, your father will come to save us! &quot;</p>
<p>Biyao&rsquo;s face gradually turned pale, but she continued: &ldquo;but my father still didn&rsquo;t come, but I was starving. I cried for food to my mother all the time. The mother looked in the hole one time, but never found anything. Later, I was so hungry that I didn&rsquo;t have the strength to cry, just lying in my mother&rsquo;s arms. Suddenly one day, my mother found a piece of meat! &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan saw Biyao&rsquo;s body shaking almost as she spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was so hungry that I couldn&rsquo;t care about anything. I ate it, and then I slept comfortably, as if my mother was laughing in the dark. In this way, my mother found me a piece of meat after a period of time, and I survived like this, but my mother&rsquo;s voice became weaker and weaker. Finally one day, I called her, but she did not answer. From then on, I was in the dark, waiting to die alone</p>
<p>Biyao slowly turned her head and looked at Zhang Xiaofan. Zhang Xiaofan was caught in her eyes and couldn&rsquo;t help but feel a chill. &ldquo;Do you know what it&rsquo;s like to die alone there? Do you know the smell of your mother&rsquo;s body rotting around you? Do you know that one can never see what it is like to live in fear forever? &quot;</p>
<p>Every time she asked, Zhang Xiaofan shivered.</p>
<p>Biyao is silent, but Zhang Xiaofan can&rsquo;t even breathe. Finally, she seems to wake up from a dream, but she doesn&rsquo;t wake up. In a trance, she goes on: &ldquo;finally, one day, suddenly, there is a light on the top of her head. I am scared to shout and hide in the deepest corner. Then, the light is brighter and brighter, and the hole above is bigger and bigger. I hear my father calling me and my mother Name, then, saw dad jump down, in front of me</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t look at me first, but first saw my mother. When the light was just shining, I only looked up and forgot to see her. When I think of it, I have been blocked by my father. I can&rsquo;t see my mother&rsquo;s body. But I can clearly see that when my father&rsquo;s body shakes, the whole person seems to have changed into a stone. Then, uncle Qinglong, uncle Baihu and uncle Xuanwu who jumped down with my father are all in the same place, motionless. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All of a sudden, I was afraid even more than I was dying in the dark. I cried in a low voice: Dad. Dad slowly turned around, three uncles in a row, standing behind him, blocking the body of his mother, I still can&rsquo;t see her. I asked in a low voice: father, how about mother? &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan could see clearly. At the moment, every word Biyao said, her body would shake, as if the girl who asked was in front of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad didn&rsquo;t say anything, but his face was terrible. Although I was small, I knew, I knew. At that time, he really wanted to kill me, my own daughter! But he didn&rsquo;t do it after all. He saved me, held me in his arms and left the dark cave. Just before I left, I secretly looked down from my father&rsquo;s shoulder. My mother&rsquo;s body had been buried by three uncles, and only one hand appeared, but I don&rsquo;t know why, that hand, that hand, that hand&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>Biyao&rsquo;s voice suddenly silenced. Zhang Xiaofan was shocked and looked at her, but she saw that Biyao&rsquo;s face was white and her eyes were closed tightly. The whole body fell down straightly and fainted. Zhang Xiaofan almost subconsciously rushed up immediately and held her, only to feel that her tentacles were cold, almost not like living people.</p>
<p>He recovered from his illness and was weak. It took the eldest brother&rsquo;s effort to lay Biyao flat on the platform. Looking at her pale face, Zhang Xiaofan suddenly realized that his whole body had been completely soaked by cold sweat.</p>
<p>That night, Biyao was in a coma, but she cried &ldquo;mother&rdquo; and &ldquo;father&rdquo; and so on from time to time in her dream. Suddenly, their positions turned to Zhang Xiaofan to take care of her.</p>
<p>But this seems to be a very painful past in Biyao&rsquo;s heart. In a coma, she screamed several times, and her cold sweat was wet. Zhang Xiaofan was at a loss. Until the end, Biyao accidentally waved her arms around, grabbed his shoulder, snuggled up in his arms, as if she had gained some support, and then she gradually calmed down and went to sleep quietly. But those hands tightly grasped Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s clothes, and even his fingernails were still in the flesh, which made Zhang Xiaofan show his teeth. But somehow, looking at Biyao&rsquo;s pale face, he couldn&rsquo;t bear to leave. He forced himself to bear it and let her snuggle in his arms and sleep. (to be continued. )</p>
