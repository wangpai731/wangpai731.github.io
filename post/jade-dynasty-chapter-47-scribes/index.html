      <p>When Zhang Xiaofan woke up, it was already dark. I was afraid that she had slept for at least five or six hours, but Biyao was still awake. She held his clothes tightly with both hands, and looked like a frightened and timid child. No one wanted to get her. She was actually an important thing in the demon cult!</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan put his hand under his head and listened to the &ldquo;whirling&rdquo; sound of the trees blowing by the mountain wind in the forest. Suddenly, he thought of the bamboo forest on the big bamboo peak of Qingyun Mountain, which also made such a sound?</p>
<p>These days, I&rsquo;m missing under the wanbat grottoes. I&rsquo;m afraid that the news has been sent back to Dazhu peak. I wonder if elder martial sister ling&rsquo;er will be sad when she knows it? However, if I suddenly appear in front of her, she will be happy. She will catch my hand and be excited. She will laugh and scold: I know you are not so easy to die!</p>
<p>His face, in the gradually dark night, raised a smile, even his eyes, in this night, so bright, but did not see, beside him, has another pair of bright eyes, I do not know when to start, looking at him quietly.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s light again, and birds are singing in the mountains, clear and sweet.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan went to the side of the stream, put his hands together, held up a handful of water and splashed it on his face. The feeling of coolness penetrated into his heart. He looked at his left hand and took off the bandage. The broken bone was almost as good as before. He was very happy. He took the fire stick that was tied on his hand and put it in his waist. He moved his left hand hard. It didn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is your hand ready?&rdquo; Baguio came from behind him, looked at him, and then squatted down to wash his face with the stream water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Zhang Xiaofan said cheerfully, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s OK. It doesn&rsquo;t hurt or hurt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Baguio gently wiped off the water drops on her face with her sleeve and said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t move around, you&rsquo;ll hurt your muscles and bones. Just rest for a while more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see.&rdquo; Zhang Xiaofan answered, then looked at Biyao and hesitated. Caidao: &ldquo;miss Biyao, now we are lucky to be alive and escape from the mountain. You and I have made a friend. But after all, different ways do not conspire. Let&rsquo;s break up here today. &quot;</p>
<p>Biyao squatted at the water&rsquo;s edge and did not get up, but her body seemed to shake for a while. Zhang Xiaofan could not see her expression.</p>
<p>After a while, I heard her low voice: &ldquo;Oh, is the way different?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan nodded: &ldquo;yes, I am the right way. You are a demon sect. My teacher has taught me since I was a child. There is no separation between the right and the evil. I&rsquo;ll see you next time. I&rsquo;m afraid that you and I are enemies and friends. I&rsquo;m really grateful that you were there to help me. This kind of kindness, I will repay you naturally in the future. &quot;</p>
<p>Biyao stared at the dim figure reflected in the clear water, and said in a low voice, &ldquo;repay me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan responded with a voice and said, &ldquo;yes, we have a clear sense of gratitude and resentment. If you didn&rsquo;t save me, I would never have survived. If there is any place where I can serve in the future, I will serve myself.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s it. Suddenly, he felt something was wrong and added, &ldquo;but you can&rsquo;t let me do something that I&rsquo;m sorry for the morality of the school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biyao suddenly stood up, turned around and said, &ldquo;I think you are a talent. It&rsquo;s better to join our holy religion. I recommend you to my father. He loves talents all the time. He will surely be willing to use you more than you are a nameless cook on Dazhu peak. &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s face sank and said, &ldquo;miss Biyao. Don&rsquo;t talk nonsense. I&rsquo;m a man in the right way. I&rsquo;d rather die than enter the devil&rsquo;s way. In my opinion, it&rsquo;s much better to be a little cook on Dazhu peak than call the wind and rain in your devil&rsquo;s cult. &quot;</p>
<p>There was a sneer on the corner of Bagao&rsquo;s mouth, and the words were sharp and cold, saying: &ldquo;the right person? You are no less evil than those of us. When you were fighting with demons, your immortal ancestors would kill people if they saw them, and the old, the weak, the women and the children would not let it go! &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; Zhang Xiaofan was furious. &ldquo;These are all good things that your demon sect did. You think I didn&rsquo;t know that when you killed people and destroyed lives&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you see those with your own eyes?&rdquo; said the green jade angrily? How could they tell you the truth for the sake of their own face? &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan sneered and said, &ldquo;have you ever seen it with your own eyes? You tell me here that it was not your elders who whitewashed the words of their ancestors that the right way was evil and the evil religion was right! &quot;</p>
<p>As soon as Bi Yao stayed, he couldn&rsquo;t speak for a while. Zhang Xiaofan looked at her and thought about her life and death together some days ago. His heart was soft. He lowered his voice and said in a soft voice: &ldquo;Miss Bi Yao, no matter what happened to her predecessors, we don&rsquo;t care about him. But we have strict rules in the Qingyun gate. It&rsquo;s forbidden for disciples to communicate with people in the demon sect. I&rsquo;m good at Qingyun and dare not violate them. Today we are Don&rsquo;t live here. I&rsquo;ll see you later. If you can repent and turn away, I, Zhang Xiaofan, will protect your life and let you get into the right way&hellip; &quot; He spoke with great courage, but stopped, only to see the sneer on Biyao&rsquo;s face</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t ask you to go, you bullshit. If you don&rsquo;t go, you should be your righteous person. I&rsquo;ll see you later. I&rsquo;ll take you first! &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was surprised. He only thought that the woman turned over faster than the book, but he didn&rsquo;t want to argue after all, and he always felt that there was a debt to Biyao. Then he bowed his hand and said, &ldquo;treasure it.&rdquo; Then he turned around and walked away without looking back.</p>
<p>After his figure disappeared in the woods, suddenly, his heart was empty, like something important was lost. The whole person suddenly lost his spirit and sat down slowly. His eyes drifted away, glancing casually over the ashes of last night&rsquo;s barbecue bunny. He was stunned at the spot, and unconsciously shed tears.</p>
<p>She looked at the pile of ashes and sat like this for a long time, until she suddenly found that the original clear birdsong in the woods behind her was suddenly all quiet, as if she felt something fierce, but she did not dare to make a sound.</p>
<p>Then, she saw a dark shadow, slowly moving out of her back, enveloping her.</p>
<p>Although it is in the daytime, somehow, it seems that the sky is also gloomy.</p>
<p>Yao Huoran looks back and stares at the people behind her. For a while, suddenly she cries sadly, &ldquo;Dad!&hellip;&rdquo; Into the man&rsquo;s arms.</p>
<p>The shadow seemed to be stunned. It seems that he didn&rsquo;t think that Baguio would have such a move at all, but he was glad to see his daughter get rid of her difficulties, but that joy could not be concealed any more.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan walked in the forest for a day before leaving the boundary of kongsang mountain. Originally, if he had walked in the sky, he would have come out in half a day, but he was still willing to walk a long way, regardless of his left hand injury, but this empty mulberry mountain has always been sparsely populated. I couldn&rsquo;t see a single person on the way.</p>
<p>After a night&rsquo;s stay in the wilderness mountain, Zhang Xiaofan stepped onto the official road. The road became more and more spacious. He asked the pedestrians on the road, inquired about the direction of the road, and went north.</p>
<p>At noon, in the middle of the day, it was very hot. Zhang Xiaofan had been on his way for a long time. I saw a small tea stand on the roadside, which was supported by a big tree beside the road. Five or six guests had already sat in it. Looking at the shade, I went there, bought a bowl of tea and had a rest by the way.</p>
<p>Let alone, the tea in this small tea stall is really cool and thirst quenching. Zhang Xiaofan drank a bowl of tea and was comfortable. It seems that this day is not so hot, and I think about it. Seeing the injury on my hand, I found a quiet place in the afternoon. Yukong flies back. It&rsquo;s faster. I can see Shifu earlier.</p>
<p>Thinking about it, he naturally thought that he would see elder martial sister Tian ling&rsquo;er soon. He couldn&rsquo;t help but feel hot. At this time, listen to the side of the road. There was a gentle voice: &ldquo;boss, give me a bowl of tea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At noon, a rare breeze blew, which made the branches and leaves on the tree shake, and scattered them to the ground. The owner of a tea stall in his fifties promised to lean over and pour tea. Zhang Xiaofan looked at the past and could not take it back.</p>
<p>A middle-aged scholar, with fine eyebrows and square face, looks elegant, but has bright eyes and full forehead, but he has the momentum of not being angry and powerful in this elegance. He wears a Confucian robe and wears a lilac jade pendant on his waist, which is exquisite and clear, and has a faint aura of auspiciousness. He knows that it&rsquo;s not ordinary.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan watched for a long time, and suddenly realized that he had been frustrated by the demeanor of the middle-aged scholar. He thought that when he came in, five or six guests who were drinking tea together at the tea stand were silent and speechless, which was suppressed by his momentum.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan took back his eyes, but he was a little surprised. At the same time, he was very upset about the demeanor of the middle-aged scholar. Although it was not so handsome to look at this man, the temperament from inside was really rare.</p>
<p>The scribe went into the tea stand, took the tea from the boss, sat down at will, and began to taste it slowly. The guests who were still talking and laughing around are all silent now. The atmosphere in the tea stall is a little strange for a while, but the middle-aged scholar is calm and has no idea of the situation around him. He is alone drinking tea and resting.</p>
<p>After a while, the other guests either had enough rest, or had finished drinking tea, and left one by one. The boss came to clean up the bowl. Under the big tree, only Zhang Xiaofan and the middle-aged scholar were left.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan didn&rsquo;t feel uncomfortable, but after sitting for a while, he felt that he had a good rest. When he was about to check out and leave, he suddenly heard a voice behind him</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was stunned. Hearing the voice, he turned around and saw that the scribe was smiling at him. He was surprised and said, &ldquo;this gentleman, but call me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The scribe nodded with a smile, &ldquo;exactly.&rdquo; Then he stood up and walked slowly. Zhang Xiaofan followed him. When he got close, he said with a fist: &ldquo;what can I do for you, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The middle-aged scribe looked Zhang Xiaofan up and down and said, &ldquo;no, it&rsquo;s just that the journey is lonely, and he looks at the little brother in the eye. Come here and have a chat. Little brother doesn&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan quickly shook his head and said, &ldquo;no, please sit down, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The scribe smiled and nodded, saying, &ldquo;come on, little brother, sit down, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they sat down, the scribe looked at Zhang Xiaofan and said, &ldquo;may I have your name, please?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan grew up in Caomiao village when he was young, and later he was taken in by Qingyun gate. In addition to the same gate of big bamboo peak in Qingyun Mountain, he said little to outsiders in recent years. Of course, the days when he was trapped in the abyss of death with the demon girl Biyao were not included. At this time, he spoke to the scribe. Somehow, he had some respect for the man. Now, he said respectfully, &ldquo;no, I&rsquo;m Zhang Xiaofan. What&rsquo;s your name, please?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The scribe first read, &ldquo;Zhang Xiaofan,&rdquo; and nodded. A little smile, said, &ldquo;my name is wan, cursive people to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten thousand people!&rdquo; Zhang Xiaofan read it in his heart. It&rsquo;s a common name to read, but it gives people a sense of gold and iron. Zhang Xiaofan can&rsquo;t help but look at him. The ten thousand people look gentle on their faces, but the power between their eyebrows seems natural. It&rsquo;s extremely heavy. With this name, it has a hidden meaning of controlling all the people.</p>
<p>Ten thousand people looked up and down at Zhang Xiaofan, and smiled, &ldquo;excuse me for asking, is brother Zhang a man of practice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was surprised. After he and Qi Hao went down the mountain, they all changed their Qingyun clothes and put on ordinary clothes for the convenience of the road. It seems that they are the same as ordinary people. I don&rsquo;t know how the middle-aged man saw it.</p>
<p>He was just surprised. He just wanted to ask how the middle-aged man knew it, but he saw the middle-aged man smile and point to the north. He said, &ldquo;excuse me, brother Zhang, but is it under the Qingyun Mountain Gate, the largest school in the right way now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was even more shocked. He couldn&rsquo;t help standing up and looking at the ten thousand people, he said: &ldquo;excuse me, brother Wan, how do you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ten thousand people waved to smile. &ldquo;Sit down, please,&rdquo; he said</p>
<p>When Zhang Xiaofan slowly sat down, ten thousand people smiled: &ldquo;I see Zhang Xiaofan, you are so full of energy. All the way down, you look young. It&rsquo;s better than many young people. In this world, the practice of Taoism prevails. I think you must be a person with unique skills. &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan bowed his head and thanked him, but he couldn&rsquo;t help saying, &ldquo;how do you know my sect, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ten thousand people laugh at will and say: &ldquo;without him, I see the little brother is dusty. I can&rsquo;t live in the north. There is a yearning color on my face. It seems like an arrow to return to my heart. In the north, the nearest and most famous Xiuzhen sect is Qingyun sect. In a word, I&rsquo;m also guessing at random. I&rsquo;m gossiping, but I&rsquo;m making a joke of brother Zhang. &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan hurriedly said: &ldquo;where, sir is so observant, you and I have never met each other, but can see at a glance, really admire, admire!&rdquo; These words are from the bottom of his heart.</p>
<p>Ten thousand people smiled and said, &ldquo;Qingyun gate is well-known in the world for a long time. It has a long history and profound Taoism. It is admired by people all over the world. My little brother is famous at a young age. There is no limit to his future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Zhang Xiaofan heard the words &ldquo;unlimited&rdquo;, he thought of Qi Hao, the dragon head peak. At last, Lin Jingyu&rsquo;s shadow flashed in his mind and shook his head and said, &ldquo;Sir, I&rsquo;m flattered. The disciple of Qingyun sect, hidden dragon and crouching tiger, belongs to a rotten tree. It&rsquo;s useless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ten thousand people were stunned for a while and said with a silent smile, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect that little brother Zhang would tell a joke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan didn&rsquo;t want to argue with him on this topic, so he asked him, &ldquo;where is brother Wan going</p>
<p>Ten thousand people stood up leisurely, shouldered their hands, looked up at the sky, and said, &ldquo;the world is huge and boundless. I travel around the world, mountains and rivers, and go at will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; Zhang Xiaofan exclaimed, &ldquo;I see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ten thousand people looked back at Zhang Xiaofan, and suddenly a strange smile flashed on their face, saying, &ldquo;since Zhang Xiaofan is under the Qingyun gate, he must have a profound Taoism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan hurriedly shook his head and said, &ldquo;no, no, I&rsquo;m a man in the Qingyun gate who can&rsquo;t be made into an artifact. How can I say it&rsquo;s profound?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ten thousand people smiled and said, &ldquo;little brother Zhang is very kind. I have a bad request. I hope you can make it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was stunned for a moment and said, &ldquo;brother Wan, please tell me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ten thousand people said: &ldquo;I admire you as a man of high cultivation, but I didn&rsquo;t have enough chance to enter. I also have a dream that I can resist the magic weapon for nine days. For decades, I have been longing for the magic weapon of an immortal family. Little brother Zhang is a famous disciple. I wonder if I can fulfill my little wish? &quot; After all, he bent down deeply and made a big gift.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was dumbfounded, watching thousands of people salute, and even panicked. He hurriedly helped them. He was really in a dilemma, hesitated for a moment, watched thousands of people look at himself expectantly, sighed, and said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid of brother Wan&rsquo;s jokes, but I&rsquo;m not willing to show brother Wan. I&rsquo;m just afraid that the magic weapon won&rsquo;t show up in the hall, and I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s in the way&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ten thousand people immediately said, &ldquo;what is this? Is there any magic weapon of the immortal family that can&rsquo;t be used on the table?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s face is reddish, but he can&rsquo;t put it down. He pulls out the fire stick from his waist and hands it to him. Looking at such a thing he handed over, thousands of people were surprised, but then disappeared and took it seriously.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan looked at him and said with a wry smile, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s you. It&rsquo;s the people in my school and they often laugh at me.&rdquo; After saying this, Zhang Xiaofan was suddenly shocked. He only felt that he was strange today. Before this stranger, he was willing to talk to him about anything.</p>
<p>The ten thousand people didn&rsquo;t notice Zhang Xiaofan. Their eyes were all on the fire stick. Originally, his face was solemn, but his eyes were still random. But gradually, he seemed to see something. Not only did his face sink, but his eyes were fixed on the black ugly stick.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan looked at it. He thought that the ten thousand people looked strange. He took the one foot long fire stick in front of him, looked at it carefully, held it with his right hand, stroked it with his left long five fingers, and clicked it gently. He was very careful. He couldn&rsquo;t help asking: &ldquo;brother Wan, what&rsquo;s wrong</p>
<p>Ten thousand people woke up in a dream, hesitated for a moment, and returned the fire stick to Zhang Xiaofan, saying: &ldquo;brother Zhang, I have read some books in this respect because I admire the immortal way, and I have some words to ask brother Zhang.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan said, &ldquo;please tell me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ten thousand people took a look at the fire stick and said, &ldquo;excuse me, brother Zhang, but this magic weapon contains your blood essence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was shocked. Suddenly, his mind wandered over the terrible scene in the valley behind Dazhu peak. He stood up and pointed to ten thousand people and said, &ldquo;what do you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ten thousand people looked at him and said slowly, &ldquo;excuse me, brother Zhang, this magic weapon, but two things are one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s secret, one of the deepest in his heart, has been told by this man. It&rsquo;s a big surprise. He just feels like he can&rsquo;t speak with a buzz in his head.</p>
<p>Ten thousand people looked at Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s astonished expression, and they knew what they expected. They saw that he looked down slightly, as if he thought of something, sighed faintly, and said, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t know, the beads on this stick were the holy things of the demon sect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan became more and more frightened, almost holding his breath, but there was a voice deep in his heart, as if sneering: &ldquo;you already know, you already know, this stick is such an evil spirit, which is naturally the evil thing of the demon sect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You, what do you say?&rdquo; Zhang Xiaofan gasped, stared at him, literally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This bead is the relic of heixin, the founder of the demon sect, 800 years ago.&rdquo; If ten thousand people go, it&rsquo;s like a nail, one by one, nailed into Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s heart, &ldquo;the name is&rdquo; blood eating bead. &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was stunned and held his breath, but there was a picture in his mind: the skeleton in the cave at the foot of kongsang mountain!</p>
<p>Ten thousand people looked at him in shock, stopped for a moment, but said lightly: &ldquo;brother Zhang, you know the origin of this bead, but you don&rsquo;t know whether you want to know the origin of this black short stick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s body shook and he couldn&rsquo;t speak. He just stared at ten thousand people. (to be continued. )</p>
