      <p>The wooden sword of the thin young man set off an extraordinary momentum and turned into a rainbow. He went straight to Bai Xiaochun. But he didn&rsquo;t wait to get close to his body. Outside Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s four feet away, in the thick light of protection, the wooden sword popped back.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun in the protection of the light in front of a bright, immediately relieved, dry cough a sound, simply sit cross knee.</p>
<p>People around looked at each other, looking at the protection of Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s body. They didn&rsquo;t know what to say. They had seen those who were good at defense, but they didn&rsquo;t see Such a protective person.</p>
<p>The young man&rsquo;s face changed red and white. He gritted his teeth and roared. He manipulated the flying sword. The power of the wooden sword suddenly increased and went straight to the protective screen.</p>
<p>The sound of thumping kept echoing. The flying sword was pounded again and again. At the end of the day, the skinny youth looked pale, and his aura was consumed by most of his body. His eyes showed despair.</p>
<p>He has been fighting with people for many years. This is the first time that he has met such an enemy like a tortoise shell. However, he is not reconciled. This time, he is fighting for the top three. At the moment, he is roaring at the sky with blood in his eyes and roaring at Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get out of here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have the ability to come in!&rdquo; How can Bai Xiaochun be afraid of each other? He roared with a bigger voice in the protective light curtain.</p>
<p>All the people around looked strange. When they looked at Bai Xiaochun, they could not help crying or laughing. But the thin young man was puffed up with anger, and a mouthful of blood gushed out from his teeth. The blood quickly melted into the wooden sword, making the wooden sword become blood color instantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blood spirit skill!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems that he is really mad with such a skill!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the same time, the speed of the bloody wooden sword suddenly increased and its power doubled. When the blood was shining, it went straight to Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>With a bang, the wooden sword pierced through the three inch light curtain and kept humming, but it could not penetrate any more. Because of too much force, there were even cracks on the wooden sword.</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, the sound of click reverberates. This wooden sword Unexpectedly, in front of Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s protection, he collapsed directly and became countless pieces scattered on the ground.</p>
<p>The thin young man&rsquo;s eyes were straight, and a mouthful of blood gushed out. The aura in his body dried up, his magic weapon was destroyed, and his Qi fainted.</p>
<p>Looking at all this, Li Qinghou looks even worse. Elder sun also smiles bitterly. He looks at the young man who is thin and thin. After finding out that there is no obstacle, he asks people to carry him away. Then he coughs and announces Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s victory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo; The light outside Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s body disappeared in an instant. His face was solemn, his head held high, and he looked arrogant. As soon as his words came out, the skinny young man who had been carried away just woke up. After hearing the words, he spewed a mouthful of blood again and fainted again.</p>
<p>With a dry cough, Bai Xiaochun clasped his fist toward sun Changlao, turned around and swung his sleeve, and walked off the stage.</p>
<p>Behind him, those outside disciples who didn&rsquo;t take part in the competition said that their looks were just weird, but those who took part in the competition were all ugly when they looked at Bai Xiaochun one by one.</p>
<p>Especially for those who have won before, they can see that the skinny young people are like this. They have to be alert to Bai Xiaochun here.</p>
<p>At the moment, the contest between the first two disciples and the last two students continued.</p>
<p>In the first ten li, Du Lingfei and Chen Ziang were all there. Bai Xiaochun raised her chin and looked around at all the other top ten members of the same family. She said secretly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One more win, and it&rsquo;s done!&rdquo; He felt that hope was just around the corner, and he was immediately excited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now choose the top five, you wait for ten people, to get the sorting ball again.&rdquo; Old Sun Chang&rsquo;s eyes swept over ten people. He stopped here for a moment and slowly opened his mouth.</p>
<p>This time, Bai Xiaochun was the first one to rush through. From his pocket in front of Sun Chang&rsquo;s face, he took out a small ball with a number of two. After looking at the number, Bai Xiaochun immediately aimed at other people.</p>
<p>Soon everyone finished smoking. When elder sun announced the beginning of World War I, besides Bai Xiaochun, a big man remained on the stage. The big man was big and laughed when he saw that his opponent was Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Others are afraid of your protection, but Li doesn&rsquo;t care. What Li is good at is protection. Look at the two of us, who can hold on to the end!&rdquo; When the big man&rsquo;s laughter came out, his right hand raised his bag and immediately took out a small shield. As soon as he vomited his aura, the shield suddenly swelled and sent out yellow light, covering his surroundings.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not over. The big man roars, and his muscles swell immediately. The whole person grows several inches at once. It looks even more amazing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s forging!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That little shield is familiar. Is it the Chenguang shield that needs 9000 contributions?&rdquo; When everyone around was surprised, Bai Xiaochun frowned.</p>
<p>Even elder sun, who was also witnessing the scene, nodded slightly. His eyes showed admiration and spoke in a low voice to Li Qinghou.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This son, Lishan, has five layers of condensing gas. What&rsquo;s more, he is born with divine power. He has achieved little in body forging. He not only increases his strength, but also has excellent protection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li Qinghou nodded slightly and glanced at Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun looked at the big man&rsquo;s transformation like momentum, and then looked at the small shield. He recognized that it was a treasure that he had seen in Baoqi Pavilion, but had not contributed enough to exchange for it. He frowned.</p>
<p>People all around showed their interest, especially the students who took part in the competition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This white younger martial brother is going to have bad luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a fluke. If you encounter such a strong enemy, you will naturally be beaten back to its original form.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just as they were talking in a low voice, the big man grinned grimly and shook his body, and went straight to Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it. I&rsquo;m different from the younger martial brother you met before. I don&rsquo;t need a sharp weapon to attack. My fist is the best technique!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His speed is very fast, set off a gust of wind, white small pure eyes in the essence of a flash, right hand raised a finger forward, immediately his small wooden sword in the storage bag flew out in a flash.</p>
<p>Floating in the front of Bai Xiaochun, without any pause, facing the coming big man, suddenly cut.</p>
<p>With this chop, the sword Qi spreads around and covers the area for several meters. With a bang, it falls directly.</p>
<p>Han&rsquo;s face suddenly changed. His scalp seemed to explode and his eyes contracted. A strong danger filled his whole body. Without hesitation, his body suddenly retreated with a roar and a wave of both hands, which immediately blocked the small shield around him.</p>
<p>With a bang, the small shield blocked the front of the wooden sword. At the moment of touching each other, but there was no crotch, the whole body vibrated, and it was directly bounced away and rushed to the big man.</p>
<p>The big man was shocked, but he couldn&rsquo;t be as fast as the flying sword. In a blink of an eye, the wooden sword came near, and the cold wind was blowing on his face. It was like being in an ice cave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give up!&rdquo; The big man roared out without hesitation, and his voice changed.</p>
<p>With a buzz, the wooden sword stops in the big man&rsquo;s eyebrows, blinks and turns around and returns to Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s storage bag.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun blinked and was surprised by his wooden sword. He had only practiced by himself before. Now he knew that his sword power had reached such a powerful level. However, he did not use the method of lifting heavy weights as light as possible.</p>
<p>As soon as he turned his eyes, he immediately raised his chin, his hands behind him, and looked at the man lightly.</p>
<p>The big man looks pale, but his eyes are not willing. After he gets up, he stares at Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the power of magic weapon, even if you win, I will not accept it!&rdquo; Han left this sentence and turned to walk down the stage.</p>
<p>Elder Sun took a look at Bai Xiaochun, and was surprised by Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s wooden sword power. Without saying much, he announced that Bai Xiaochun won.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha ha, next time, just admit defeat. Our friars are not all for longevity. It&rsquo;s too savage to fight and kill. It&rsquo;s not what I want to do.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun is very happy in his heart. He has finished Li Qinghou&rsquo;s request and now he has entered the top five.</p>
<p>Li Qinghou&rsquo;s eyes fell on Bai Xiaochun. Others only saw the flying sword, but what he saw was not the flying sword, but his ability to control it.</p>
<p>Seeing that Bai Xiaochun won another match, people around him were filled with emotion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This man is rich, and that wooden sword is very good. Hum, if I have this kind of magic weapon, I can win it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Magic tools are foreign objects after all. This person is first those charms and then magic weapons, but his real ability is wasted, and he will surely suffer in the future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This kind of sour argument did not last long. Later, in the last fight, Du Lingfei&rsquo;s opponent was excellent in cultivation and powerful in fighting. In this battle, Du Lingfei no longer used the sail flag, but took out the flying sword. They fought for each other. All of a sudden, Du Lingfei&rsquo;s flying sword suddenly increased in speed, and its speed was so direct In front of his opponent.</p>
<p>This speed has exceeded the speed of ordinary disciples controlling things. All the people around me were stunned, and then one by one seemed to think of something and suddenly burst into an uproar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like lifting a heavy load like a light!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Du Lingfei, she actually realized such a state&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lift heavy as light!&rdquo; Elder sun&rsquo;s eyes twinkled. In the depths of the two purposes, he was surprised and looked at Du Lingfei.</p>
<p>Li Qinghou nodded slightly.</p>
<p>Chen Ziang was also shocked. Other top ten people were like this one after another. The disciples who fought with Du Lingfei at the moment gave a bitter smile and gave in to defeat.</p>
<p>Du Lingfei stood on the stage, looked around arrogantly, and clasped his fist to Li Qinghou and elder sun. Then he went on.</p>
<p>In the crowd, the noise still did not disperse.</p>
<p>Only Bai Xiaochun blinked here.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At this speed, you can lift heavy weights as light as you can?&rdquo; He was a little surprised.</p>
<p>Du Lingfei, with a proud look, stepped down from the stage with sweat on her forehead. She fought for two consecutive battles. Although she was full of five layers of gas, she still lost some aura. Especially in the battle just now, her opponent&rsquo;s fighting power was not so good. Finally, she had to use the method of lifting weights as light as possible, increasing the consumption of aura, and then she could win in an instant.</p>
<p>Her goal is to be the first, and in the next few games, the enemy will become stronger and stronger. Moreover, the rules of this clan&rsquo;s small ratio are not so strict, and they will not give people too much time to rest. So she immediately took out a pill and swallowed it, closed her eyes and tried to recover in all time.</p>
<p>Now, the top five have been decided. Besides Bai Xiaochun and Du Lingfei, Chen Ziang is also among them. There are two young people who have achieved outstanding accomplishments and are also the fifth layer of condensate gas.</p>
<p>At the moment, the other four people are in operation, trying to recover some aura as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Only Bai Xiaochun did not have any consumption at all. He stood on the other side of the martial arts stage as if nothing had happened. After seeing it, all the contestants who had been eliminated wanted to beat him up.</p>
<p>He has entered the top five and completed the requirements of Li Qinghou. He doesn&rsquo;t care about the next competition.</p>
<p>At the moment, when she is idle and bored, Bai Xiaochun glances at the other four people, especially Du Lingfei. Bai Xiaochun thinks that if the speed of the other party is too light, she is obviously much faster than this woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this girl has a lot of evil spirit. As a good girl, she likes to fight, kill and kill. Is it that all the women who cultivate immortals are not normal? Zhou Xinqi is too arrogant, Hou Xiaomei&rsquo;s personality changes too much. &quot; Bai Xiaochun shakes her head and is about to take back her eyes. Du Lingfei seems to have checked her. She opens her eyes and stares at her coldly.</p>
<p>To Bai Xiaochun, Du Lingfei didn&rsquo;t look up to her at all. In addition, she had two contests. In her opinion, the other party won by chance, and her heart was even more contemptuous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you dare to stare at me!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun quit immediately. He stared at Du Lingfei. As long as he didn&rsquo;t fight for blood, Bai Xiaochun had never been afraid of anyone.</p>
<p>Du Lingfei frowns. Those admirers behind her are also dissatisfied at the moment. They all look at Bai Xiaochun fiercely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are so many of them that good men don&rsquo;t fight with women.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Bai Xiaochun looked at the other party&rsquo;s many eyes, especially many of them were fierce. She coughed and felt that her eyes were a little weak. She snorted and quickly took them back.</p>
<p>At this time, the voice of elder sun reverberated in the arena.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good, this time outside Xiaobi, your performance is very good, now you have determined the top five, so go ahead, you five choose to fight, take out the small ball of the order of five, count it as the wheel, automatically enter the top three.&rdquo; Elder sun smiles and waves his right hand. His pocket appears.</p>
<p>This time, Chen Ziang was the first one to come forward. He frowned when he took out the ball. The number on his ball was four.</p>
<p>Du Lingfei also stepped forward and took out the two goals. The remaining two outer disciples also took out, one was one and the other was three.</p>
<p>Do not need white Xiaochun to come forward, the remaining number is five, calculate his empty.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s eyes showed a surprise. He laughed and stood outside the stage with his arms in his arms. He looked at Du Lingfei&rsquo;s four men without any pressure. He didn&rsquo;t intend to continue to compete. However, seeing that he didn&rsquo;t have to do anything, he went straight to the top three.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Luck is a part of strength.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun is proud of himself.</p>
<p>This kind of luck makes people around him look even more strange when they look at Bai Xiaochun. Many other disciples are very unconvinced by him, especially those who are eliminated. They are envious and envious from the bottom of their hearts, which is extremely complicated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This guy is so shameless that he can enter the top five with his magic weapon. He can even enter the top three in the air</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shame, the appearance of this man is the biggest disgrace for Xiao Bili this time!&rdquo;</p>
