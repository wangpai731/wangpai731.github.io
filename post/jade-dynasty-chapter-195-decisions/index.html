      <p>South Xinjiang, 100000 mountains.</p>
<p>In front of the vast black forest where GUI Li and Jin pinger once crossed, there are more than a dozen people standing in front of them. Most of them are the elite disciples headed by Li Xun in the burning incense valley of Southern Xinjiang. Among them, only two outsiders are Lu Xueqi and Zeng Shushu of Qingyun gate. As for Wen Min, who had been with Lu Xueqi and Zeng Shushu earlier, she was unexpectedly missing.</p>
<p>Many of these people are slightly tired. It is obvious that although they are monks, it is still not easy for them to go deep into the dangerous and strange place of 100000 mountains. Only Li Xun, Lu Xueqi, Zeng Shushu and others, who are the leaders, have profound morality and face as usual.</p>
<p>But at this moment, looking at the front of that dark strange forest, but no one is happy.</p>
<p>In the sky above the black forest, the poisonous miasma is obviously rising continuously, which is obviously impossible to get out of the sky. The black forest has a vast area and can not be easily bypassed. In addition, Li Xun, who served as a guide all the way, has clearly said that according to the legend of the people in southern Xinjiang, the lair of animal demons is in the ancient cave behind the black forest.</p>
<p>This forest seems to have to go!</p>
<p>The Tianya sword is shining with light blue light in Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s hand, reflecting her white and slightly lonely figure. When Wen Min is away, she seldom talks to Li Xun and other disciples of burning incense Valley, or Zeng Shushu, who is also a member of Qingyun sect, and she seldom pays attention to it.</p>
<p>Along the way, there were many frightening things for her, such as mountains and rivers, poisonous insects and beasts. For her, she just turned a blind eye or died under the sword. No one knew what was on her mind.</p>
<p>Li Xun didn&rsquo;t know, and Zeng Shushu didn&rsquo;t know either. At the moment, Li Xun coughed at Zeng Shushu and asked in a low voice: &ldquo;that Elder martial brother Zeng, may I ask the younger sister Lu who is silent all day. What is she thinking? &quot;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu was stunned and then said with a bitter smile, &ldquo;elder martial brother Li, I think you have asked the wrong person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li Xun took a look at him. After a while, he shook his head and couldn&rsquo;t help laughing bitterly.</p>
<p>At the moment, Lu Xueqi was alone after a day&rsquo;s hard work, when they were about to enter the black forest. Standing at the edge of a rock far away, overlooking the distant mountain, behind her, there are many eyes from time to time, wandering between the beautiful back, intentionally or unintentionally.</p>
<p>Li Xun and Zeng Shushu stand aside.</p>
<p>The former pondered for a moment and said, &ldquo;elder martial brother Zeng, we&rsquo;d better ask younger martial sister Lu to come over and discuss how to act next.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu nodded and said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s right.&rdquo; Then she turned around, went to Lu Xueqi and whispered a few words to her. Lu Xueqi was expressionless. After listening to Zeng Shushu, she took a look at Li Xun. Li Xun was slightly embarrassed and gave a dry smile.</p>
<p>After a while, Lu Xueqi finally came back with Zeng Shushu. Li Xun coughed and said, &ldquo;well, you two, after you have passed through this black forest, you will not be far from the monster&rsquo;s nest. We&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Senior brother Li!&rdquo; Suddenly, Lu Xueqi called Li Xun and interrupted him.</p>
<p>Li Xun was stunned, since he entered the 100000 mountain. It can be said that this was the first time Lu Xueqi took the initiative to talk to him and was surprised: &ldquo;what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi looked at him, and there was a glimmer of light in her eyes and said: &ldquo;these days down. I don&rsquo;t understand one thing all the time. I want to ask elder martial brother Li for advice. &quot;</p>
<p>Li Xun nodded and said, &ldquo;sister Lu, please tell me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi didn&rsquo;t seem to be a little more friendly because of Li Xun&rsquo;s politeness. She generally said, &ldquo;in the past, all the news we heard from the burning incense Valley said that the 100000 mountains were dangerous. Even you seldom enter. But I don&rsquo;t know why. It seems that elder martial brother Li is very familiar with this place. Have you been here before? What&rsquo;s more, the trace of the beast God is very secret, and the secret of the nest is beyond description. How can the burning incense Valley be so well informed that it can know this? &quot;</p>
<p>Li Xun looks the same. In the face of Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s question, Li Xun seems to have a plan in mind for a long time. He said with a smile: &ldquo;younger martial sister Lu, I have already told you that before, we did not care about the 100000 mountains in the burning incense Valley, but we will certainly pay attention to this place once there is a monster disaster. As for the beast demon nest, it was discovered by our disciples after tracking the remains of the beast demon, so many of our elite were sacrificed for this. &quot;</p>
<p>Both Zeng Shushu and Lu Xueqi frowned at the same time. Obviously, they didn&rsquo;t believe Li Xun&rsquo;s empty and perfunctory words. However, they could not directly refute what he said, so they were silent.</p>
<p>Li Xun chuckled, looked at both of them and said, &ldquo;speaking of this, I remember again. How could you send that elder martial sister Wen minwen back to Qingyun Mountain when we were about to enter the 100000 mountain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu was stunned. She glanced at Lu Xueqi nearby, and then said with a smile: &ldquo;we told elder martial brother Li that we had already told him. Elder martial sister Wen Min had a temporary business, so she had to rush back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beside Lu Xueqi slightly lowered her eyes and did not speak. The reason why Wen Min went back to Qingyun Mountain temporarily was that even Zeng Shu didn&rsquo;t know much about it. In fact, in the final analysis, it was also because of the question about the destruction of Zhuxian sword that appeared suddenly by Yun Yilan on the mountain and river Hall of Fen Xiang valley.</p>
<p>Zeng Shu didn&rsquo;t know the truth, so she thought it was a joke to forget. After discussing with Wen Min, Lu Xueqi felt that this matter was very important. After several deliberation, she finally decided that Wen Min should rush back to Qingyun Mountain and tell the elder masters about it. It&rsquo;s better to change. After all, the ancient sword of killing immortals is of great significance to Qingyun gate and the right way in the world. The Fuxiang Valley, which has always been a good friend with Qingyun gate, and the valley master, Yun Yilan, this unexpected performance has some unspeakable implications, which makes people uneasy.</p>
<p>However, the animal God here is also very important, can not give up, so after discussion, Wen Min rushed back to Qingyun Mountain, Lu Xueqi and Zeng Shushu left. However, in Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s mind, the gate keeper of incense Valley, at the moment, seems to have been everywhere strange.</p>
<p>At the moment, Li Xun has discussed with Zeng Shushu for a long time. He has explained many matters needing attention when he enters the black forest. Zeng Shushu knows a lot of things he has never heard of. He can&rsquo;t help but open his eyes and nod his head and have a good talk with Li Xun.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi listened to those words in her ears. Somehow, she felt bored. She stood up and walked to one side again, looking out into the distance. In the distance, the faint mountain is continuous. Highland ups and downs, under the vast sky, cold wind whistling.</p>
<p>Who knows what is waiting for them in front?</p>
<p>Qingyunshan. Dazhufeng.</p>
<p>In the early morning of this day, when the time was still early and the talent was dim and bright, all the disciples on Dazhu peak had not yet got up, but a slight footstep sound came from Shoujing hall. A moment later, Tian is not easy to be unconventional in the morning dressed neatly and walked out.</p>
<p>In the morning light, Tian is not easy a round face, the face is dignified, brow is frowned, look to the appearance of heavy heart. Su Ru followed him and came out. Judging from the appearance of the couple, we don&rsquo;t know whether they got up early or stayed up all night.</p>
<p>Su Ru is deeply worried on this facet. After leaving the Shoujing hall, she first takes a look at the disciple&rsquo;s house. Seeing the unexpected silence, she murmured, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not easy. I still think it&rsquo;s not appropriate for you to do so. Let&rsquo;s discuss it again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi&rsquo;s face was as deep as water, and his eyebrows did not loosen at all. He said in a deep voice: &ldquo;it can&rsquo;t be delayed any longer. Since we went back to the ancestral temple, elder martial brother daoxuan&rsquo;s condition has become worse and worse. The news from Tongtian peak yesterday came down. It&rsquo;s said that he went to persuade him, Mr. Fan and Xiao Yicai. &quot;</p>
<p>Su Ru was startled and said, &ldquo;what, the headmaster, how could he do it? What about the two of them. How did you offend the leader and elder martial brother? Did you get hurt? &quot;</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi snorted and said: &ldquo;what else can they do for? Of course, it&rsquo;s because elder martial brother daoxuan behaves strangely and goes to advise them. It&rsquo;s said that elder martial brother daoxuan had a good conversation with them. But I don&rsquo;t know why he suddenly got angry and cut off his palm. At the same time, elder martial brother fan was seriously injured. However, Xiao Yicai was very alert. He ran away from him, but nothing happened. &quot;</p>
<p>Su Ru was stunned for a moment and frowned: &ldquo;is Xiao Yicai OK?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi pondered for a moment and said, &ldquo;he has always been smart, and he has followed elder martial brother daoxuan for many years. He knows more than others. Most of them found out that the situation was wrong in advance, so they grasped the opportunity and escaped by fluke. But thanks to his alertness, he has time to rescue elder martial brother fan and heal him. Otherwise, no one can tell what will happen. &quot;</p>
<p>Su Ru remained silent for a long time. Her face was uncertain. She said for a long time, &ldquo;he and he have become like this. Why do you want to see him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Buyi took a deep breath and said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s ok if others don&rsquo;t know. Don&rsquo;t you understand why I went to see him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru whispered, &ldquo;but he The headmaster&rsquo;s elder martial brother is possessed by demons at the moment. No one knows what he is thinking. Moreover, he is so high in morality that he is far superior to you and me. If you go on this adventure, I&rsquo;m only afraid of&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>After that, Su Ru&rsquo;s voice became lower and lower, which was hard to hear at last. Obviously, she did not want to speak out.</p>
<p>Tian Buyi sighed and looked back at Su Ru. He stretched out his hand and gently held Su Ru&rsquo;s slender hand. He said in a soft voice, &ldquo;you and I are husband and wife all my life. Of course I know what you are worried about. With your heart, I don&rsquo;t care what happened to me&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>Su Ru frowned, interrupted him and said angrily, &ldquo;what are you talking about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi nodded and was silent for a moment, and then said: &ldquo;you know that. The secret of the ancient sword of killing immortals is the highest secret of Qingyun gate, which is only known by the master. However, during the wild war, several people, including myself and Zeng Shuchang, followed elder martial brother wan to fight against Wanli Huangsha. By chance, they learned the secret. Later, several of us made a solemn oath in the ancestral hall in front of the spirit of the ancestors of Qingyun gate. We will never reveal any secret in our whole life. &quot;</p>
<p>Su Ru sighed and said, &ldquo;why did you mention this again? I was there at the beginning and swore as much as you. How could you not remember?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi said: &ldquo;since the ancestor Qingye left his own admonition tablet, the ancestors of all ages have given three admonitions. The ancient sword of killing immortals should not be lightly used. In the stele of master Qingye&rsquo;s admonition, it is even more clear that the sword spirit to kill the immortal is the most ferocious spirit. If the sword holder&rsquo;s mind is not firm and his foundation is unstable, he will fall into the evil way. Now, elder martial brother daoxuan, this kind of vision is not just the realization of what the founder said! &quot;</p>
<p>Su Ru lowered her head and remained silent for a long time.</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi looks up at the bright sky. In the distance, at the end of the mountain fog in the morning, where the clouds are shrouded, the figure of the towering Tongtian peak looms faintly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over the years, elder martial brother daoxuan has worked hard to make our school prosperous and prosperous. Today, he has become the leader of the world.&rdquo; Tian Bu Yi&rsquo;s voice suddenly added a sense of vicissitudes, &ldquo;I have thought about it. Even if elder martial brother Wan was really in charge of teaching, I&rsquo;m afraid it might not be better than elder martial brother daoxuan. &quot;</p>
<p>Su Ru&rsquo;s body trembled slightly, and she called out in a low voice: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not easy&hellip;&rdquo; But the latter words, she seemed to stop.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not easy for a field to bear his hand. His face was a little perplexed, and he said: &ldquo;although I still secretly worshipped elder martial brother Wan&rsquo;s spiritual position for many years, I should be honest with elder martial brother daoxuan. I really admire him more and more. Although there are many quarrels on weekdays, I have nothing to say about his behavior. Even ten years ago, when he used the sword to kill Lao Qi&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not easy. Don&rsquo;t say it!&rdquo; Su Ru suddenly called out, I don&rsquo;t know how, looking at the field is not easy, her eyes actually some red.</p>
<p>Tian is not easy to move his muscles.</p>
<p>He managed to squeeze out a smile. However, he could not see the slightest smile. He was just sad: &ldquo;you are the one who understands my heart most. In the war ten years ago, I, I&hellip; &quot; With a long sigh, he said, &ldquo;I really can&rsquo;t give up old seven! In this group of disciples, although the boy looks the most unpleasant, I still Ah! &quot;</p>
<p>With a long sigh, neither of them spoke until after a while. Tian Bu Yi gave a wry smile like self mockery and said, &ldquo;I was very dissatisfied with elder martial brother daoxuan after that day. I raised the seventh elder brother. In the past ten years, don&rsquo;t I know who he is? I will teach him what he has to do. Maybe there is still room for improvement. But that sword goes down, hey hey, Lao Qi is still OK. He killed a Biyao first. This is a good time. Lao Qi has to do something wrong. With his stubborn nature, he is afraid that all his life will be destroyed by that sword. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;However, in recent years, I have occasionally reflected on myself. When I think about it, I have thought that if I was in the position of senior brother daoxuan, would I cut the sword or not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru gazed at her husband without saying a word. She just took his palm and patted him on the back of his palm with a touch of comfort.</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi gave a faint smile, with a bit of helplessness, to Su Ru, he said with a smile: &ldquo;if I had changed, I&rsquo;m afraid I would still have to chop that sword.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As if she had known the answer for a long time, Su Ru silently bowed her head and did not speak.</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi also silent down, staring at the distant direction of the sky peak.</p>
<p>After a long time, Su Ru suddenly said, &ldquo;since you have made up your mind, why don&rsquo;t I accompany you to see elder martial brother daoxuan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Buyi shook his head and said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;d better not go. There are more people, but it&rsquo;s hard to talk. Elder martial brother daoxuan became like this for the sake of the common people and the Qingyun gate. I don&rsquo;t know, but I can&rsquo;t just sit back and ignore it since I know the secret. I always have to go to see if there is still room for salvation. I just hope that elder martial brother daoxuan can wake up from the anger. Otherwise</p>
<p>When he said this, his voice stopped abruptly.</p>
<p>Su Ru looked at him and suddenly gave a smile. The sad look on her face suddenly disappeared. Instead, she had a look of heartache and love. She said in a soft voice, &ldquo;OK, don&rsquo;t say anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian is not easy to get along with her for a long time, and they are already in the same mind. At this moment, he stares at Su Ru for a long time. After all, he doesn&rsquo;t speak any more and just nods.</p>
<p>A moment later, he turned around, and the bottom of his wide sleeves began to flash red.</p>
<p>Seeing that his red flame sword was about to go on a long journey, Su Ru suddenly called out: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not easy&hellip;&rdquo; Although the tone of the voice was not very high, it was full of emotion and tenderness, which was all in the short two words.</p>
<p>Tian is not easy to look back, looking at his wife, Su Ru&rsquo;s face is full of reluctant to give up, tears flickering in his eyes. After a long time, Tian Bu Yi suddenly smiles and waves his hand. His lips move for a moment, but he still doesn&rsquo;t say anything. He turns around to offer the red flame fairy sword and soars into the air with a roar.</p>
<p>The red light, passing through the sky, penetrated into the clouds. At the beginning, the clouds and fog turned and retreated one after another. Then they surrounded him from all directions and gradually disappeared.</p>
<p>Only Su Ru was left, staring at the sky. She did not know how long she had stood. On the Yunbin, she did not know when there was a little morning dew, crystal clear, like pearls, falling quietly. (to be continued. )</p>
