      <p>Xiao Yicai lowered his voice, and his face became a little dignified and said, &ldquo;my teacher asked me to ask martial uncle, is everything still in good condition?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian is not easy to change his face. He suddenly stands up and stares at Xiao Yicai. Xiao Yicai also slowly stands up, but he takes a step back. Tian Bu Yi looks at Xiao Yi for a long time. His face changes constantly. At first, he is surprised and shaken. After calming down, he turns to meditation. At last, he seems to have another strange light in his eyes. Looking at Xiao Yicai, he suddenly says, &ldquo;it seems that elder martial brother daoxuan really wants to pass on his position as leader to you in the future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai slightly bowed his head and said, &ldquo;martial uncle&rsquo;s words are heavy. I don&rsquo;t dare to be a disciple.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi said, &ldquo;he didn&rsquo;t even hide this from you. Naturally, he understood it. Forget it, this is the matter of tongtianfeng. I don&rsquo;t care about it. But as for the seal of heaven, &ldquo;he said in a deep voice,&rdquo; this matter is not trivial, but also involves the power of Qingyun. In those years, the founder of Qingye once issued an order to the head of Qingyun&rsquo;s seven veins, so he had to use it as a last resort&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>He took a deep breath and said, &ldquo;we all understand the relationship. I just want to ask, does elder martial brother daoxuan really think clearly? &quot;</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai&rsquo;s expression at the moment is extremely cautious. After pondering for a long time, it seems that he dare not say a word wrong. Then he nodded his head and said, &ldquo;yes, the master has already explained to the disciples very carefully before he leaves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian was not easy to ponder for a moment and said, &ldquo;what about the&rdquo; seal of heaven&rsquo;s mechanism &ldquo;of the other five veins except Tongtian peak and Dazhu peak</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai said respectfully: &ldquo;the master only told his disciples about this. Because he felt that martial uncle Tian is the most respected one in Qingyun gate, he came to ask for his advice first. As for the other five veins, I will visit you later. &quot;</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi nodded slowly and sat back on his seat again. After thinking for a long time, he sighed: &ldquo;if you want to talk about the current situation, it&rsquo;s really a critical moment. The fate of all the people in the world is in this war. The leader and elder martial brother want to go all out. I have nothing to say. But when you go back, tell him something for me. &quot;</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai looked respectful and said, &ldquo;yes, uncle Tian. I will bring it to you. &quot;</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi was pale and said: &ldquo;once the seal of heaven&rsquo;s seven veins is removed, the evil spirit of Qingyun Mountain, which has been suppressed for thousands of years, will inevitably be released. Although it has been suppressed by the ancient sword of killing immortals, it can be turned into a killing intention.</p>
<p>However, it is also very important to erode the foundation of Tao in the drama that the swordsmen are harmed. Elder martial brother daoxuan is good at nature, but it&rsquo;s not trivial. I&rsquo;d better ask him to think about it in advance, just in case. &quot;</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai said, &ldquo;yes, I&rsquo;ll bring it to you if you like.&rdquo; After a pause, he continued, &ldquo;if Uncle Tian has nothing else to do, I will leave first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi nodded. No words. Xiao Yicai saw that his face was heavy, and did not dare to say much at the moment, so he slowly retreated out.</p>
<p>In the Shoujing hall, only Tian Bu Yi is left. He slowly turned around and looked at the statue of Taoist ancestor Sanqing in Shoujing hall. His face was complex. After a long time, he just sighed, but he still didn&rsquo;t say anything.</p>
<p>When Xiao Yi flew back to Tongtian peak, it was already late at night. Tongtian peak is full of lights. There are many disciples of the original Qingyun sect. In addition to the numerous righteous people who have poured into Qingyun recently, this fairyland like place on earth has become a bit crowded and secular.</p>
<p>But Xiao Yicai didn&rsquo;t care about it. He went straight to the Yuqing hall at the top of the mountain. After inquiring about the whereabouts of the Taoist immortal from Qingyun&rsquo;s disciples in the Yuqing hall, he walked to the bedroom of the Taoist immortal in the back hall of the Yuqing hall.</p>
<p>When he came to a secluded place in the back hall, Xiao Yicai stood at the door of daoxuan immortal, calmed down, and just wanted to raise her hand to knock on the door. In the room, the voice of immortal daoxuan was heard saying, &ldquo;is it Yicai? Come in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai smothered for a moment and immediately said, &ldquo;yes.&rdquo; With that, he gently opened the door and went in.</p>
<p>The room is very spacious, all the furnishings with the smell of books. In addition to the simple tables, chairs and beds, there are many books on the bookshelves on both sides of the room. Among them, many ancient books are placed neatly on the bookshelf. It can be seen that they have been read many times by the owner.</p>
<p>Daoxuan was sitting at his desk with an ancient scroll in his hand. He was reading. When he saw Xiao Yi, he came in. He laughed and said, &ldquo;are you coming back now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai made a deep ceremony and said, &ldquo;yes, master.</p>
<p>&quot;</p>
<p>Daoxuan nodded and said, &ldquo;how is everything going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Yi said: &ldquo;there is no opinion on the head of the seven channels. They all say that the master&rsquo;s idea will prevail. Only uncle Tian of dazhufeng&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taoist priest frowned and said, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s wrong with Mr. Tian?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai even said, &ldquo;no, uncle Tian didn&rsquo;t object. He just asked his disciples to bring a few words to tell the master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan was stunned and said, &ldquo;what are you talking about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai repeated Tian Buyi&rsquo;s words. Immortal daoxuan was speechless after listening to it. Xiao Yicai, standing on one side, looked at it secretly. In the meantime, the real man daoxuan had a complicated complexion and seemed to be thinking about something. His expression changed constantly.</p>
<p>Just as Xiao Yicai guessed what Taoist priest was thinking, he suddenly said, &ldquo;Yi Cai, what do you think of Uncle Tian?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai was surprised. He didn&rsquo;t know what the real man daoxuan meant. He took a look at him, but he couldn&rsquo;t see anything special. At the moment, he had to say cautiously: &ldquo;well, I think, uncle Tian It&rsquo;s still very good. &quot;</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan laughed. Obviously, he didn&rsquo;t care much about this disciple&rsquo;s opportunistic remarks. He only listened to him leisurely: &ldquo;yes! He&rsquo;s a very good man. Hehe, it&rsquo;s hard for him to be discerned by people&rsquo;s eyes just like he was at the beginning&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>The words of immortal daoxuan suddenly stopped, and the room fell into a state of calm. Xiao Yi moved her body slightly and felt a little uneasy.</p>
<p>After a while, daoxuan was really humane: &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve been running for a day and you&rsquo;re tired. Go back and have a rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai nodded and saluted, &ldquo;yes.&rdquo; Then he stepped back out slowly.</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan watched the figure of the proud disciple disappear from his sight, pondered for a moment, and then looked out of the window at the dark sky. He slowly stood up and walked out. Soon, his figure melted into the night of Qingyun Mountain.</p>
<p>Although it&rsquo;s late at night. But in the secluded ancestral hall of Tongtian peak, the ever burning lamp is still burning, like a faint fire in the dark. The old man guarding the ancestral hall has not fallen asleep yet. He is standing in front of the table dedicated to the ancestral shrine of Qingyun gate. Staring at the names in the dark shadows.</p>
<p>In the distance, there was a low chirp of insects.</p>
<p>In silence, as if there is any heartbeat sound!</p>
<p>When the night wind blows, the flame of the lamp shakes and trembles as if panting. The old man slowly turned around and went to the long-term lamp. He gently blocked the direction of the wind with his hand. Soon, the light quieted down and began to burn steadily again. The old man gazed at this light deeply, and the light reflected in his eyes, as if burning something.</p>
<p>In the middle of the night, suddenly came the sound of footsteps, the old man&rsquo;s eyebrows frowned. After listening carefully, he turned around slowly, and the old man&rsquo;s voice said slowly, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect you would come back at such a late time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The figure of daoxuan immortal gradually became clear from the darkness and entered the ancestral hall.</p>
<p>Under the dim yellow light, the eyes of the two old people collided in the air. They were all stunned for a time, and all of a sudden, they all found out. It turns out that the other party has been so old, and then think of it, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan was silent and looked at the old man for a long time. Then slowly walked to the front of the table, standing under the Lingpai of the ancestors of Qingyun gate, slowly straightened up. The old man came up behind him and said nothing.</p>
<p>In the dark, the invisible prestige spreads slowly from those shadows, like the deep traces that the years can not erase. Daoxuan&rsquo;s face was expressionless. He took three sticks of incense from the offering table, went to the place where the candle was lit, held it with both hands solemnly, bowed respectfully to the ancestral tablet, and then took a step to insert the incense into the incense burner.</p>
<p>The faint smoke curls up from the censer and spreads out in the air, which makes the spiritual positions in front of us more hazy and unclear. It looks like a pair of eyes, coldly looking at the two old people and the world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Burning incense in the middle of the night, is there anything difficult?&rdquo; The old man asked faintly, in a flat tone, as if he were saying something that had nothing to do with himself.</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan didn&rsquo;t look back at him. His eyes were always staring at the dignified spirits behind the smoke. After a moment, he said slowly, &ldquo;what kind of mood will it be like for future generations to worship us after you and I pass away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man snorted and said, &ldquo;of course, you are full of reverence. As for me, will anyone remember it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan didn&rsquo;t care about the old man&rsquo;s sarcastic words, just a faint smile. Then, he said quietly: &ldquo;at present, the world is suffering from the ravages of beasts and demons.</p>
<p>As long as I think of the inevitable battle between Qingyun Mountain and the beast demon, it is even more related to the number of people in the world. These burdens are on my shoulders, and I haven&rsquo;t slept well for many days. &quot;</p>
<p>The old man frowned and said, &ldquo;you are not here to complain to me, are you? It&rsquo;s not your nature. &quot;</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan looked at the old man for a moment, then burst out laughing, and then sighed, &ldquo;you and I have been friends for hundreds of years, and you are the only one who knows me best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man shook his head and said, &ldquo;I know what you are? If so, I will not be here to guard the ancestral hall. Well, stop talking nonsense. What do you want to say? &quot;</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan seemed to be very tolerant to the old man. After several confrontations, daoxuan didn&rsquo;t care, but his face was a little solemn. He said slowly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve made up my mind. This war has a lot to do with it. I want to remove the seal of heaven from the seven peaks of Qingyun Mountain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man&rsquo;s expression suddenly became stiff, his eyebrows locked, and he looked at daoxuan deeply. After a long time, the old man said slowly, &ldquo;do you think about this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Daoxuan nodded his head slowly and said, &ldquo;but today, when I secretly informed the head of liumai, Tian Buyi had someone tell me something, and advised me to be careful of my anger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a cold smile, the old man turned to face the ancestral tablets and said for a long time, &ldquo;you are not a stranger to the magic moon cave. You know what&rsquo;s in it.&rdquo; After a pause, his voice suddenly eased down, and there seemed to be a trace of helplessness in it. He said, &ldquo;you can do it yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan was silent. After a moment, he also raised his head and looked at the dark shadow. The silent dignity seemed to sneer in the darkness.</p>
<p>Seven days later, there were more and more rumors about the appearance of beast demons in the land around Qingyun Mountain, within a hundred miles. At the foot of the mountain, the crowd can be seen everywhere. As if at this moment in the world, only the towering tall Qingyun Mountain can give people a little comfort and security.</p>
<p>And in the din of the crowd. Heyang city is the most chaotic place. The streets and alleys are full of people. The original inns and restaurants in the city have been full of people for a long time. More refugees have to stay in the open air. In this case, the food supply in Heyang city has become very tense. Fortunately, because the city is by the river, there is no need to worry about the water source.</p>
<p>In such a chaotic situation, it is difficult to guarantee that there will not be some looting and murder and other evil things. In fact, there are rumors from time to time. Who disappeared yesterday, and today I heard that someone was dead in the street. However, Heyang city is at the foot of Qingyun Mountain after all. Qingyun gate has already made preparations and sent quite a number of disciples to maintain order in the city. Therefore, in general, these countless refugees are in the midst of this catastrophe. Nothing has happened yet.</p>
<p>However, with the horror of the monster rumors day by day, no one can predict what tomorrow will be like? In this case, Heyang city is filled with more and more uneasy atmosphere, people are in a panic.</p>
<p>It is in this case that Zhou Yixian, a wandering monk in the world, came to this city with his granddaughter Xiaohuan and wild dog Taoist priest. Standing in the once spacious street, but now only see the dense human head, the street is also crowded and difficult to walk, the dog Taoist is just returning. On Monday, Xian and Xiao Huan were stunned.</p>
<p>With the help of wild dog, the Taoist is strong and fierce. When he opens the road in front of him, the man with less strength is pushed away. The strong man looks back at the Taoist priest&rsquo;s face. Most of them dare not say anything more. On Monday, Xianhe and Xiaohuan followed the wild dog and barely moved on. They were sweating all the way. They finally crossed the street and turned into an alley in the west end of Heyang city.</p>
<p>The three of them were walking in, and there were many people standing in the old quiet lane. But compared with the crowd on the street outside, it&rsquo;s really spacious. On Monday, the immortals swore in a low voice and looked very angry. It&rsquo;s just that I escaped for my life. How could so many people run with me, and it was so uncomfortable for me to escape.</p>
<p>The lane is very long and winding, and the more people walk in, the fewer people there are. After about half an hour, the three people come to the end of the lane. There are no more refugees here. The reason is very simple, because it is a village. However, when you look at this small villa, half of its wooden doors fall to the ground, and the other half is gone. I don&rsquo;t know whether it was taken as firewood.</p>
<p>Looking at the villa, Monday immortal shook his head and sighed. Xiaohuan stood beside him and whispered, &ldquo;grandfather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wild dog is a little puzzled, but he was born in a demon sect. He doesn&rsquo;t care much about the bad luck places of these Yizhuang. He just has some doubts about how the immortals of Monday and Xiaohuan will come to this place.</p>
<p>Monday immortal was silent for a long time and said, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go in! Anyway, it should be quiet here. &quot;</p>
<p>After that, he went in first, and Xiao Huan and wild dog followed him. Walking into the villa, I saw the grass and trees desolate in the small courtyard. There were scattered sawdust and residual beams everywhere. There seemed to be some white things shining in the grass. Xiao Huan&rsquo;s face turned pale. She couldn&rsquo;t help but hold the clothes of Monday fairy.</p>
<p>Zhou Yixian looked back at her and said in a low voice, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not the first time I&rsquo;ve come here. What&rsquo;s your father afraid of? Besides, this is also the place where your father lives. Will he harm us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Huan nodded, his face was better. The wild dog man frowned at the back, but he didn&rsquo;t say anything.</p>
<p>In front of the courtyard is the gate house of the Yizhuang Village. Monday fairy walked forward and saw the door covered with dust. I don&rsquo;t know how long no one has been here. He was silent, shook his head, sighed and pushed the door open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cheep&hellip;&rdquo; The wooden door made a harsh sound, and slowly retreated into it. A musty air gushed out. In the dim light, there were three coffins lying in disorder, but the covers of the coffins had been scattered to one side.</p>
<p>Unspeakable years of desolation, as if in this small room, faint out. On Monday, the angel of the immortal&rsquo;s mouth twitched twice, and his face was pale. He walked up slowly without looking at the scattered coffins nearby. Instead, he went straight to the sacrificial table where incense was used to offer spiritual tablets, and looked at the dozens of tablets on the table.</p>
<p>The room was so quiet that no one seemed to dare to speak. Monday immortal slowly stretched out his hand, picked up the tablets, slowly wiped off the thick dust on them, took a look, put them aside, and then went to find the next one. In this way, when he cleaned up the seventh one, he saw the handwriting on the tablet which said &ldquo;the spiritual position of love son Zhou Xingyun&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Monday fairy stopped and looked at the trump silently for a long time. Xiaohuan came up slowly and looked at the magic card in his hand. His eyes were moist and he whispered, &ldquo;grandfather, put dad&rsquo;s trump card away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Monday, the fairy gave a breath and nodded. Xiaohuan took the Lingpai from his hand and carefully placed it on the altar. Then he stepped back, folded his hands, and respectfully saluted the memorial tablet. In a low voice, &ldquo;Dad, my grandfather and I have come back to see you again. Thanks to you, my grandfather and I have traveled all over the world, but everything is fine.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll clean it up for you today. I hope you don&rsquo;t blame us. &quot;</p>
<p>With that, he bowed down respectfully and said goodbye three times.</p>
<p>Seeing from the back, Taoist wild dog suddenly went to the front and worshipped the memorial tablet three times. However, he startled Zhouxian and Xiaohuan. Xiaohuan was surprised and said, &ldquo;Taoist priest, how can you&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wild dog Taoist priest did not look at the strange eyes of Monday immortal and said, &ldquo;since he is your father, that is, my elder, I should show my respect to the elder when he comes to this place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan was relieved and nodded: &ldquo;thank you very much.&rdquo; Then she turned her head to the tablet and said, &ldquo;Dad, this is the wild dog Taoist priest. He is a good man and has helped my grandfather and me a lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhou Yixian snorted and said, &ldquo;is he a good man? Hum, he has a bad heart&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wild dog Taoist looks stiff, but Xiao Huan has already glared at Monday fairy and says, &ldquo;grandfather, how can you talk nonsense?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Monday fairy rolled his eyes and looked away. Taoist wild dog looked at Xiao Huan gratefully. Just as he was about to speak, he suddenly turned around. Xiaohuan and Zhouxian felt something, and looked at the door of Yizhuang at the same time.</p>
<p>In the originally desolate and silent villa, a man in black suddenly appeared at the door of the house. His face was covered with black gauze, which was very strange. Originally because of the arrival of three people, such as Monday fairy and so on, the villa has become a bit popular, but now because of the appearance of this person, suddenly fell into a deeper silence and desolation.</p>
