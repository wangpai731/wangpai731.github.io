      <p>China is vast and vast. In addition to the people who are called the spirits of all things, there are also countless people born in this world. Such as poultry, chickens, pigs and dogs, beasts such as wolves, tigers and leopards, are familiar to people.</p>
<p>Since ancient times, there have been a lot of anecdotes and legends in the world. In the wild and remote places of Shenzhou, among the poor mountains and rivers, there are some ancient beasts, wild Taoism, and human remains. For thousands of years, countless hot-blooded young legends of catching dragons and demons have been talked about and passed down from mouth to mouth.</p>
<p>Among these various legends, the fox demon family may not be the most ferocious and powerful monster, but there is no doubt that it is the most magical, mysterious and the only one with some worldly wisdom in the eyes of the world.</p>
<p>When ancient monsters such as &ldquo;black water black snake&rdquo; become the goal of countless young people to prove their cultivation strength, the fox demon often seems to be ambiguous in people&rsquo;s mouth. Although there has been a legend of the fox demon hurting people, but different from other monster legends, the fox demon family often leaves touching stories such as falling in love with people, which is a very prominent and other strange thing in the legends of various kinds of monsters harming the world.</p>
<p>Of course, these are just handed down among ordinary people and common people. In the eyes of real practitioners, the fox demon family is a group of extremely intelligent and even cunning creatures. Their power is far less than the mysterious ancient animals such as black water black snake, but these monsters know human relationship, and even the legendary cultivation to a certain extent, the fox demon family actually has the ability to change into adults, which is the reason why those miserable and beautiful human demon love spread out.</p>
<p>Among the fox demons, there is one of the most intelligent and mysterious branches. It&rsquo;s said that with the increase of cultivation, the tail behind them will continue to grow. There will be three tails in a hundred years&rsquo; practice, which is called the demon fox. There will be six tails in a thousand years&rsquo; practice, which is called the spirit fox. When there are nine tails, it&rsquo;s the supreme realm of monsters in the world. No one knows how much they need to practice Years to reach. But in the legend, the fox demon who has reached the nine tails of Taoism has become a peerless monster. Its magic power is connected with God, and it is for the &ldquo;nine tails of heavenly Fox&rdquo;!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that the legend is amazing. Most people don&rsquo;t know about it, but it&rsquo;s like a mirror in ghost&rsquo;s heart. Not for anything else, just ten years ago, under the Fire Dragon Cave. That pair of fox demons who died for love was the first time that his once firm belief had been impacted in his life.</p>
<p>Every once in a while, the lonely and beautiful white fox figure can be seen vaguely.</p>
<p>The blue light of Daodao reflects to the surrounding from the hard and cold ice, which makes the three layers of the altar bright and dark. In front of the ghostly and small grey body, from the deepest part of the darkness, in the light blue with some weird light, a huge figure slowly appeared.</p>
<p>A white fox, a huge white fox!</p>
<p>For the first time in his life, GUI Li saw the real body of such a huge white fox. From the place where he stood, the white fox was twice as tall as he was, two people tall. Even in this light, the pure white fur is still so beautiful, and the smooth fluff is as soft as the best silk in the Central Plains.</p>
<p>This is an animal that makes people feel beautiful at a glance, but its body is so huge, unconsciously, it also feels a little horrible. In fact, this white fox is in a state of extreme excitement.</p>
<p>The original silence of the altar space is now full of white fox&rsquo;s lament and shriek. Set in a pair of black deep eyes on the white skin, it is also full of Madness at the moment.</p>
<p>The blue light is brighter and brighter. I don&rsquo;t know when the wind has blown. The sharp clothes are fluttering, and the little ash is shrieking. Grin at the white fox and make a fierce shape.</p>
<p>Huo Di, white fox throat a neighing, Huo Ran front foot off the ground, actually straight up, almost in line with its action. GUI li felt the sudden blue light of the solid ice around him. In the roar, two huge ice cubes, which were more than three people high, moved out of the sky and smashed at GUI Li.</p>
<p>The grimace frowned tightly, and the blue light of the soul devouring flashed, carrying him and Xiaohui back quickly. Almost at the same moment when their figure disappeared, two huge pieces of ice collided with each other, making a deafening noise, which turned into crushed ice and scattered on the ground.</p>
<p>But before they stop, the solid ice on the three floors of the whole altar glowed with blue light at the same time. In an instant, the strange demons in the space were powerful. Countless or large or small pieces of ice slowly floated up into the air, and it was extremely beautiful and strong.</p>
<p>The brow of ghost Li is even tighter. This Nine Tailed Fox is really powerful. All kinds of monsters and monsters he met in the past few years, except the mysterious ancient giant beast like black water snake, are the most powerful of all.</p>
<p>But somehow, when his eyes peered through countless ice blocks shining with beautiful, enchanting and blue light, and looked at the white figure, as well as its slightly crazy and deeply sad eyes, some feelings that had not been seen for many years, just like the body shadow of the martyred Fox began to wander in his heart, but in any case, he did not want to fight against the white fox.</p>
<p>However, he was hesitating here, but the Nine Tailed Tianhu there was a scream. In an instant, countless floating ice cubes in the middle of the sky were all roaring at the speed of lightning.</p>
<p>As soon as his face was cold, he put out his hand and hugged the ash to his chest. At the same time, he flew out to the side of the ghost. For a while, I saw blue light flickering all over the sky, solid ice like rain, and the sound of ice collision and roar could not be heard. Every moment, countless white light blue ice, chasing that blue figure.</p>
<p>But the green shadow, like a ghost, often hides in the past, in the ice rain, or left to right, or up and down, avoiding the endless layers of ice rain.</p>
<p>White fox&rsquo;s shrill voice is more fierce, but somehow, it seems that there is some lack of middle spirit in the anger. In the middle of the fight, suddenly I saw a flash of green shadow. The ghostly figure somehow passed through layers of ice and rushed to the white fox itself.</p>
<p>The white fox was startled. Its beautiful white hair was windless and automatic. With a wave of its front paw, it was about to use some strange magic. Unexpectedly, at this moment, a dark red light suddenly rose from behind it. Almost at the same time, the white fox was shocked, as if it had been hit hard, its eyes were disordered, and the demons&rsquo; strength was all dissipated, and its body fell down.</p>
<p>And in the next moment, the green shadow floats to, a pale hand stretches out from the light, quickly and incomparably grabs to the white fox&rsquo;s neck.</p>
<p>The white fox gave a low cry. Eyes full of pain and helplessness, but look at its expression, but then close their eyes, as if to admit life. Close your eyes and wait for death.</p>
<p>The tentacles, with ice cooling is still soft fur, ghostly hands fell on the throat of the white fox, white fox&rsquo;s huge body in front of him, but somehow. Now it&rsquo;s just like the fragile bird in his hand.</p>
<p>Xiaohui lies on the chest of the ghost and shrieks a few times.</p>
<p>Ghost Li silently looks at the white fox in front of him and slowly retracts his hand.</p>
<p>White fox slowly opened his eyes, fell into its eyes, was standing in front of the man&rsquo;s figure.</p>
<p>One person, one fox, just stare at each other like this!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boom!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a roar, the ice flying all over the sky behind the ghost body lost the power of the demon and fell down one after another, colliding with each other. The ice crystal splashed all over the place, and the white cold fog drifted around, rushing over from behind, completely covering up the figure of the ghost and the white fox.</p>
<p>For a long time, the ice dust gradually fell, the ghost and white fox figure reappeared.</p>
<p>Little grey did not know when he climbed on the shoulder of GUI Li again. Three eyes blinked and blinked. He looked at GUI Li and the white fox in front of him. Then he looked around again, as if suddenly interested in the beautiful ice crystals scattered around him, he jumped down from his shoulders and sat on the ground. Pick up some beautiful ice blocks with blue light and play with them.</p>
<p>White fox&rsquo;s eyes ghost Li body moved to the body of small ash, looked deeply, then returned to ghost Li, a moment later, said: &ldquo;why don&rsquo;t you kill me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Its words sound at the moment. Obviously, he had calmed down, and the ghost didn&rsquo;t answer immediately. He looked behind the white fox unexpectedly. Soon, he found what he thought.</p>
<p>A dark red iron chain, which is as thick as an ordinary arm, is locked in the waist of a white fox. At the moment, I can only see the red light in the iron chain faintly rising. I can feel that strange magic power from afar.</p>
<p>Just now, the white fox suddenly lost its power in the fierce fight. Obviously, this prohibition has played a role. It&rsquo;s no surprise. How could the xuanhuotan trap the Nine Tailed heavenly fox without such a powerful prohibition?</p>
<p>White fox looked at GUI Li. GUI Li didn&rsquo;t answer his question. It didn&rsquo;t seem to care, because what it cared about was just another thing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about the sixth? Did you kill it and take the &ldquo;xuanhuojian&rdquo; Its voice is very low, very tired.</p>
<p>The ghost is sharp silent, after a long time slowly way: &ldquo;you say small six, is a six Tailed Fox with six tails?&rdquo;</p>
<p>White fox&rsquo;s huge body slightly shakes and lowers its head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s dead!&rdquo; The shrill voice was not loud, but it was very clear.</p>
<p>White fox&rsquo;s eyes looked at the ground in front of him, and said, &ldquo;how can I die?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten years ago, I was with Two friends heard that there was a monster under the black stone cave in Xiaochi town. They went to check it. &quot; The face of the ghost is as calm as water, talking about the past lightly.</p>
<p>For a while, there was no sound in the huge space, only his voice drifted gently, and occasionally came the sound of little ash playing nearby.</p>
<p>“…… In the end, when he saw that nothing could be done, and the three evil foxes died, he decided to commit suicide. Before he died, he bound the xuanhuojian to my hand. &quot; Guili reached out and took out the xuanhuojian from his arms. He saw that under the blue light around him, the ancient Fire Totem seemed to be burning gently.</p>
<p>White fox looked at xuanhuojian in a dazed way, as if he had been infatuated with it, but he didn&rsquo;t know how long it was. He said in a low voice, &ldquo;little six is my son!&rdquo;</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>The silence seemed to be dead. The ghost looked at the white fox in front of him, and suddenly he could not breathe.</p>
<p>Engraved in the deep heart into the hot magma that white fox shadow, clear as in front of us.</p>
<p>Ten years, as if only yesterday.</p>
<p>What is it that quietly changes my mind?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the one who killed your son.&rdquo; &ldquo;Ghost Li says lightly,&rdquo; in the future you have the opportunity, although come to kill me good. &quot;</p>
<p>White fox raised his head and looked at him deeply. Somehow, ghost Li suddenly felt that white fox was smiling, with thousands of years of vicissitudes, with a light sad smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can give you XuanHuo Jian. I&rsquo;m his mother. Don&rsquo;t you know what it meant at that time?&rdquo; White fox said quietly, slowly turned around, locked in its waist chain issued a harsh voice, imprisoned him.</p>
<p>Looking at the white fox slowly walking towards the dark depth, the ghost Li suddenly felt a strange impulse and blurted out: &ldquo;what can I do for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The body of white fox paused, but did not turn around, just its voice, suddenly had a faint excitement: &ldquo;would you help me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li didn&rsquo;t speak. No answer.</p>
<p>White fox slowly turned around, at this moment, all of a sudden, its black and deep eyes seemed to have a strange light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three hundred years ago. Our fox demon family snatched xuanhuojian from the burning incense Valley, but I was killed and injured. Except for Xiaoliu, I survived and was imprisoned in the XuanHuo altar. Suffering from &ldquo;XuanHuo chain&rdquo;. One body of magic power is suppressed by the XuanHuo chain and the &ldquo;eight fierce XuanHuo array&rdquo; under the XuanHuo altar, suffering day and night. &quot;</p>
<p>With a sneer, he said, &ldquo;if burning incense Valley didn&rsquo;t want to know the whereabouts of xuanhuojian from my mouth, it would have killed me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ghost Li nods in silence.</p>
<p>White fox took a look at him and said: &ldquo;this XuanHuo chain is a foreign body in the world. The sun is just blazing. Once it&rsquo;s locked, it can&rsquo;t be opened unless it&rsquo;s a person who knows the secret mantra of burning incense valley. But in addition, as long as there is xuanhuojian, you can open this thing! &quot;</p>
<p>A ghostly look. Slowly turned to the xuanhuojian in hand, the light gentle feeling, from the ancient Fire Totem on the xuanhuojian, came out.</p>
<p>The voice of the white fox continued in front of him: &ldquo;xuanhuojian is the essence of all fire, an artifact of heaven opening.&rdquo;. As long as you go to the end of the stone wall behind me, there is a stone platform in the shape of a cylinder, from which the XuanHuo chain stretches out, and at the same time goes deep into the underground volcanic magma, drawing endless heat from it. If you put the XuanHuo Jian on the stone platform, you can untie the XuanHuo chain. Without this prohibition, the eight murderous XuanHuo array, which is not presided over by xuanhuojian, has already trapped me. &quot;</p>
<p>Speaking of the back, white fox&rsquo;s voice was a little shaky. Obviously the mood is agitated.</p>
<p>GUI Li didn&rsquo;t speak, his face was as calm as water.</p>
<p>White fox looked at him. A moment later, he was deeply disappointed in his eyes. Suddenly, he smiled bitterly and said softly, &ldquo;do you regret it? Let it go. In fact, who is not in this world? &quot;</p>
<p>Said, it seems to turn around again, but suddenly moved.</p>
<p>He walked slowly forward, walked by the white fox&rsquo;s side, and the little ash behind him raised his head. He seemed to be interested in the situation here again. He jumped up and up on his shoulder.</p>
<p>The ghost Li passed by the white fox, and the White Fox also turned around. The huge body accompanied the ghost Li. Somehow, it seemed to have a different vision in its eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young man, why do you want to help a monster?&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li didn&rsquo;t look back, didn&rsquo;t move. White fox followed him and couldn&rsquo;t even see his face. Just a moment later, he heard the man walking alone in the dark and whispered: &ldquo;in fact, who is not in this world?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten years ago, when I put the two of them down with my own hands; ten years ago, when she fell from the sky, I watched her fall&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>White fox stopped, the end of the XuanHuo chain has a very strong ban on monsters, it can not go forward. And Xiaohui seems to feel something at the moment. She jumps off her shoulders and stops beside Baihu.</p>
<p>And the ghost, did not stop.</p>
<p>White fox silently watched, the darkest place of the dark light sprinkled, the man&rsquo;s figure swallowed.</p>
<p>It sighed suddenly!</p>
<p>A moment later, it turned around the huge Fox&rsquo;s head and approached the little grey. The little grey faced the monster that was hundreds of times larger than itself, but there was no color of fear, &ldquo;squeak&rdquo; twice, and looked at the white fox with three eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he a sad man, too?&rdquo; White fox secluded tunnel.</p>
<p>Little ash blinked, squeaked and scratched his head with his hand.</p>
<p>White fox a smile, laughter in how many vicissitudes of life sad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can you know that you are not good enough, that you are at the beginning of wisdom, and that you are in love with people in the world?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It whispers softly to you, and its voice is getting lower and smaller. It vaguely hears: &ldquo;there is such an infatuated man in the world, which will make us still deeply * will&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<hr>
<p>Entrance to the burning valley.</p>
<p>The atmosphere is more and more solemn, and the scene is quiet. The people of the fish people glare at the leader of the official policy above the burning incense Valley, but the people of the burning incense valley are thrilled.</p>
<p>Many disciples have begun to look around secretly. The cold wind blows, and the branches and leaves dance gently. The low cry from nowhere in the dark makes people feel cold.</p>
<p>The superior officer&rsquo;s brow is tight and his face is grim. The unknown murderer is not afraid of his cultivation. However, it&rsquo;s really worrisome that the people who have this kind of Taoism are so cruel and ruthless, and they clearly want to provoke the conflict between the burning incense Valley and the barbarians.</p>
<p>Is it that the plot of burning incense Valley for a hundred years has finally been revealed?</p>
<p>As soon as I think about it, I think Shangguan&rsquo;s policy is profound and firm, and my heart is still in turmoil.</p>
<p>But after all, he is not an ordinary person. After a while, he has calmed down. He knows that the mysterious murderer is in the dark at the moment. He must not be disordered. And for the first time in hundreds of years, someone has been so bold and reckless in the burning incense valley. If I don&rsquo;t teach you a lesson, I&rsquo;m afraid that the cat and dog will dare to make trouble in the future!</p>
<p>The superior officer decided to calm down and move his head to the side. Li Xun understood and came forward. The superior officer said coldly: &ldquo;when the order goes down, all the disciples will start it up and seal the outlet of each valley mouth. In addition, all the &lsquo;red eye carvings&rsquo; will be released and circled in the sky. The murderer must not run away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li Xun nodded, hesitated for a moment and whispered: &ldquo;uncle, that valley master&rsquo;s side&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The superior officer shook his head and said: &ldquo;since the valley master asked you to send me a message to deal with this matter tonight, he must still be unable to separate.</p>
<p>You know him&hellip; &quot; In the middle of the conversation, shangguance suddenly stopped talking and looked up at Lixun. &ldquo;Later, I will naturally explain to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li Xun bowed his head and said, &ldquo;yes, I will do it now.&rdquo; Then turn around and go.</p>
<p>When he walked back, the disciples of the burning incense valley around him made way for him. From the very beginning, they stood by him and listened to Yan Hong, who was talking with shangguance. They looked at Li Xun in their bright eyes, which seemed to flicker.</p>
<p>Li Xun&rsquo;s figure soon disappeared into the darkness of the burning incense valley. There was a commotion among the fishermen, and several of them began to squeak at the same time. The head of the giant fish man talked with other monsters for a few words, and turned back with a face full of anger, &ldquo;squeak&rdquo; and kept talking.</p>
<p>Shangguan CE frowned, and sun Tu beside him had translated: &ldquo;they told us to hand over the murderer who killed their clan leader quickly, or we would be killed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shangguance snorted and looked at the fishermen coldly. The fishermen were obviously afraid of shangguance. They were all a little angry for a while, but after the brutality came up, even more fishermen began to roar angrily.</p>
<p>Shangguance knows that these fish people and barbarians can&rsquo;t be reasonable. At present, the event of burning incense Valley is about to happen. It&rsquo;s not the moment when they fall out with these Southern barbarians. Moreover, the peerless figure hidden in the 100000 mountains is not only him, but also the valley master Yun Yiding, who is a Taoist, is afraid of three points.</p>
<p>He was thinking about how to appease these barbarians for a while, and slowly said, &ldquo;you guys, I&rsquo;m going to give you an explanation for today&rsquo;s affairs, but I&rsquo;m going to aggrieve you here for a while&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The voice did not fall, suddenly, without warning, the earth under his feet shook violently.</p>
<p>The vibration was so violent and sudden that many disciples and fishermen of the burning incense valley were caught off guard and fell to the side.</p>
<p>Shangguan&rsquo;s advice is very profound. Naturally, it is different from those ordinary disciples. Almost in an instant, he stabilizes himself. Under his consternation, he turns the corner of his eyes and sees Yan Hong standing beside him. However, he only stands a little slower than himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my God, it&rsquo;s changing color!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know who was the first one to shout out. In a moment, everyone looked up and saw that the original dark night sky suddenly turned red. Countless clouds, like burning flames, moved rapidly around a place. There was a sound of wind and thunder in the dark. The weather was very spectacular.</p>
<p>As one of the officials was shocked, his face suddenly changed. He almost subconsciously turned around and looked at it. As expected, the place surrounded by countless fire burnt clouds and clouds was the place where the mysterious XuanHuo altar was located.</p>
<p>Shangguan&rsquo;s plan was to meet with rage. He couldn&rsquo;t care about other things any more. He stamped his foot hard and turned into gray light and flew to XuanHuo altar quickly and incomparably. But at the moment when his body was in the air, somehow, his mind flashed a light doubt like lightning:</p>
<p>How can Yan Hong&rsquo;s skill be so advanced? (to be continued. )</p>
