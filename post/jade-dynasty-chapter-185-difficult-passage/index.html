      <p>As usual countless days, the melodious morning bell rings again, reverberating between the Xumi mountains and in the misty mountain breeze. It has gone through countless years, and it will reverberate day after day in the future.</p>
<p>Standing in the morning light, he stood with his hands and listened.</p>
<p>He closed his eyes slightly, as if the bell was ringing to savor. At the moment, I don&rsquo;t know why, his appearance has not changed much, but it seems that he has changed his personal feeling. From his manner, he seems to be more calm and less angry than before.</p>
<p>Maybe, are those Dharma arrays really working?</p>
<p>Many of the monks in Tianyin temple have this question in their hearts after they wake up.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, after GUI Li woke up again, master Pu Hong and others carefully looked at him. He found that there was no other major obstacle to his body. Even the slight shock after being hit hard did not exist in Gui Li. Master Pu Hong was overjoyed. In order to be on guard, he stayed in Tianyin temple for a few more days. GUI Li did not refuse, so he stayed in Tianyin temple.</p>
<p>Over the past few days, GUI Li has been more reticent than usual. Most of the monks in Tianyin temple have avoided such a figure as him who even provoked heaven and sent down punishment. Only master Puhong and Dharma equal people have never scrutinized anything and often come to see him. However, GUI li himself did not seem to notice the external personnel. He did not go out of the house. Only when the drums sounded in the morning and evening, he would walk into the small yard and listen quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dong&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The last bell, with a continuous aftersound, reverberated and hovered over Tianyin temple for a long time, and finally turned into silence. GUI Li opened his eyes slowly.</p>
<p>In the temple, the sound of the morning is like the sound of the wind. The monks of Tianyin Temple don&rsquo;t know, but they understand it in their hearts.</p>
<p>Between the wordless jade walls, what happened unexpectedly was the fourth volume of the book of heaven, which was the classic of the demon sect. Others may not understand, but he is the only one in the world who has practiced the first three volumes of the book of heaven. At a glance, he can see that it is the fourth volume of the key to his dream on the way to practice.</p>
<p>In the past, countless seemingly indestructible and insurmountable problems in the past practice are at this moment.</p>
<p>He has already grasped the key points, and what is in front of him is almost a broad road, and the smooth road is infinite. Even in his heart there is such a feeling, this road to go on. He must be very smooth, perhaps, he can also peep into some of the past did not dare to expect the realm.</p>
<p>It was when he looked at the past feelings and the personnel in front of him that he had a sense of detachment, like having a new realm and looking back on the past.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t know why, in his heart, in such a good situation, he still has a faint sense of loss. But I don&rsquo;t know how to describe it. That looming, wrong idea, always entangled in his mind.</p>
<p>Standing for a long time, no one knew what he was thinking, and no one came in to disturb him. Until he suddenly turned around and walked out of the small courtyard for the first time in days.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t look back when he left the yard.</p>
<p>He walked slowly along the steps under his feet, which is said to be the road. It was once created by the monk with great supernatural powers in order to carry forward Buddhism and make great wishes. Today, countless people still walk on the road he made, but a few people know. He&rsquo;s gone.</p>
<p>Walking on this road, the layers of stone steps are simple and unadorned. When you step on it, you can feel plain. After the unexpected battle of changing the sky and shaking the earth a few days ago, all the temples and halls on Xumi mountain were damaged to varying degrees. Only this plain step mountain road. It was not affected by the slightest impact, or firmly laid on the ground, let countless people walk through its chest.</p>
<p>Perhaps, for the unpredictable gods, is this road also with some special emotions?</p>
<p>GUI Li didn&rsquo;t know, and he didn&rsquo;t want to know. Walking along the road, he just thought of the past and his old friends. In the memory, he slowly walked to the small Tianyin temple on the top of Xumi mountain.</p>
<p>The door was open, and it was still as quiet as usual. The ghost walked slowly past. Behind the door, there was a faint voice of words.</p>
<p>He knocked on the door.</p>
<p>The sound inside the door suddenly disappeared, and then someone seemed to be suspicious. A moment later, the door leaf opened with a &ldquo;squeak&rdquo;, and the Dharma appeared behind the door.</p>
<p>Seeing that it was GUI Li, FA Xiang showed a smile, and he nodded his head and said, &ldquo;is the abbot there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>FA Xiang smile to get out of the way: &ldquo;yes, please come in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li walked in and saw master Pu Hong sitting on the Zen bed with his knees crossed and looking at him with the same smile.</p>
<p>GUI Li went to the master Pu Hong and saluted him, saying, &ldquo;master abbot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong looked at the figure of GUI Li coming from top to bottom, and finally looked at his feet. He suddenly nodded and said, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine that in this short time, the benefactor&rsquo;s road has made great progress. It&rsquo;s really gratifying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ghost Li eyebrow a pick, did not speak, FA Xiang is slightly surprised, at the side of a careful look at GUI Li.</p>
<p>After a moment&rsquo;s silence, he bowed his head slightly to the master Puhong and said, &ldquo;a few days ago, for my sake, I damaged the holy land of your temple, the wordless jade wall. I&rsquo;m really upset.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong shook his head gently and said calmly, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s just a little thing. It&rsquo;s not worth mentioning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The jade wall without words is the treasure of the temple, isn&rsquo;t it precious?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong combined ten ways: &ldquo;the world turns, all living beings don&rsquo;t have it. Who knows what&rsquo;s going on behind you? How can we know what will happen in the future? If you have a heart, &ldquo;he pointed out the window and said,&rdquo; there is a big stone on the right outside the small Tianyin temple. If you have a look, you may know the truth of Buddha&rsquo;s heart. &quot;</p>
<p>He nodded his head and said, &ldquo;yes. But I want to say goodbye to the abbot</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong didn&rsquo;t have an unexpected look on his face. He seemed to have expected that Gui Li would speak like this. He just nodded and said, &ldquo;benefactor, I dare not stop you. Just before the benefactor left, I have a few words to say to the benefactor. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master, please speak up,&rdquo; he said</p>
<p>Pu Hong said: &ldquo;benefactor, during this period of time, there have been many calamities, but they have been able to solve them one by one. I think the benefactor has realized something in his mind. I don&rsquo;t know if it is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>After pondering for a moment, he nodded his head and said, &ldquo;master, you are wise. I have a feeling for the rest of my life. Looking back at half a life, I can feel sighing. &quot;</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong&rsquo;s eyes flashed and said, &ldquo;benefactor is a man of great wisdom. Now that we have seen through it, why don&rsquo;t you see through the worldly feelings and return to our Buddhism? According to my guess, what the benefactor thinks in his heart is nothing but &ldquo;quiet&rdquo;. How about it? &quot;</p>
<p>He stood up for a long time, saluted the master Puhong and said, &ldquo;master, I am very grateful. It&rsquo;s just that I have some understanding in my heart, but I don&rsquo;t see through the world. As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, I can&rsquo;t part with the worldly feelings. &quot;</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong shook his head and said, &ldquo;Buddha said: color is emptiness! All things in the world are like this. They are enemies of beauty.</p>
<p>Being is just a word for &ldquo;color&rdquo;. It puzzles people&rsquo;s mind and disturbs people&rsquo;s quietness. Why should the benefactor be too persistent? &quot;</p>
<p>He looked up to the sky to breathe, laughed, turned away, and said in a loud voice: &ldquo;master, it&rsquo;s wrong. Color is emptiness, and emptiness is color. You want me to see through the world, but I don&rsquo;t know how to see through the world? I&rsquo;m between heaven and earth. Gratitude and resentment are the circumstances of my life. You want me to see through the quiet, but where to know, that after seeing through. But is it still me? &quot;</p>
<p>The voice gradually sank and finally disappeared. The man had left the meditation room for a long time.</p>
<p>The Dharma Minister remained silent for a long time and said to Pu Hong, &ldquo;master, you enlighten him several times, but it&rsquo;s a pity&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong said faintly, &ldquo;he understands the Tao Dharma. I&rsquo;m afraid I will be the first person in the world in the future. But such a character can&rsquo;t see through his own demons. In the future, he will see his own nature. &quot;</p>
<p>The Dharma minister bowed his head and chanted Buddhist sutras together. He finally stopped speaking.</p>
<p>GUI Li left xiaotianyin temple. When he walked out of the temple gate, he suddenly stopped and stopped for a moment. He turned to the right and didn&rsquo;t take a few steps. As expected, he saw a big stone more than half a person high falling on the ground.</p>
<p>He went to the big stone and looked at it carefully. He saw that the stone was full of marks, but there was no word or mark of manual chiseling. He did not know what the mystery of the stone was.</p>
<p>GUI Li frowned and pondered for a moment. Suddenly, he was attracted by the stone.</p>
<p>The whole body of the stone is mottled. Obviously, it has experienced many years in countless years. It is scarred by wind, sword, frost and sword. But in that place, it can be seen that it is a pattern shape. It&rsquo;s just that it&rsquo;s too old to recognize.</p>
<p>GUI Li reached out and gently swept away the dust on the stone. After a long time, he recognized that it was a shell shape, but over time, it had been turned into stone and integrated with the stone. And GUI Li then looked at the big stone and found no other strange place.</p>
<p>His eyes went back to the shell again. Could it be that master Pu Hong wanted him to see that this ordinary shell could not be made. What was the mystery behind it?</p>
<p>In his heart, he recalled what master Pu Hong had said again, and his eyes were fixed on the shell, which slowly lit up. The mountain range of Xumi mountain is high, and there is no sea water and deep ocean for thousands of miles. But this stone is clearly the thing on Xumi mountain. Thousands of years ago, this place might have been a vast ocean, but it was unknown.</p>
<p>Human life, compared with the operation of heaven and earth, the vicissitudes of the world, is just like a drop in the ocean.</p>
<p>However, he was silent and turned to salute the quiet little temple. When he turned his head, his face was still indifferent.</p>
<p>His figure turned into light and disappeared in the sky.</p>
<p>See through!</p>
<p>Who can see through it?</p>
<p>The vicissitudes of the world, but how can compare with my heart moment, that moment of glimmer.</p>
<p>Qingyun Mountain, Dazhu peak.</p>
<p>It has been a long time since the battle of Qingyun. After that, immortal daoxuan kept a close eye on the people of Dazhu peak for killing immortals. But recently, it seems that because the disciples of Dazhu peak are very honest, the leader doesn&rsquo;t urge them. Originally! In the hearts of all the disciples of dazhufeng, although the headmaster daoxuan Zhenren is of great importance this time, his actions are really too much.</p>
<p>But anyway, after all, this time has been undisturbed for a long time, and dazhufeng has gradually returned to its former calm. Wu Dayi and he Dazhi are getting better and better. After Su Ru&rsquo;s inspection, they are almost all right now. They can walk freely, but they can&rsquo;t do heavy work yet.</p>
<p>Therefore, in the past, in accordance with the usual practice, the task of cleaning the rooms of the young martial brother who had left the secluded corner at the same time also continued. On this day, song Daren and Du Bishu walked to the room again.</p>
<p>They talked and laughed. Like countless times in the past, I walked into the yard.</p>
<p>But at this moment, suddenly, a gray shadow suddenly flashed through the small yard which should have been quiet.</p>
<p>The gray shadow is very fast. But song Daren and Du Bishu saw it almost at the same time. Under their shock, they immediately put down their hands to clean things and rushed up. But the gray shadow disappeared in a blink of an eye. They searched the yard. Even the roof also looked for the past, but still did not find any clues.</p>
<p>Standing in the courtyard, song Daren and Du Bishu looked at each other. Song Daren frowned and said, &ldquo;are we wrong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Du Bishu tilted his head and thought about it. He was about to speak. Suddenly, he said in a quiet voice: &ldquo;elder martial brother, look over there.&rdquo; After that, he pointed to song Daren.</p>
<p>Song Daren quickly turned to look, and saw along the direction of Du Bishu&rsquo;s fingers.</p>
<p>Originally, the door was closed in my younger brother&rsquo;s bedroom, but there was a small crack in the window beside the door. In the past, no one lived here, so the windows were closed tightly.</p>
<p>Song Daren and Du Bishu looked at each other, and they saw each other&rsquo;s eyes in disbelief. Song Daren calmed down and said in a low voice, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go in and have a look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Du Bishu somehow got nervous. He nodded, but at the same time, he could not help lowering his voice to song Daren: &ldquo;elder martial brother. Is it possible that It will be younger martial brother, he&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>Song Daren&rsquo;s eyes jumped. It was obvious that what he thought was similar to Du Bishu, but even he seemed to be afraid of this idea. Perhaps, really see that now unfamiliar little younger martial brother, he does not know how to face it?</p>
<p>Hand, when touching the wooden door, song Daren and Du Bishu looked at each other again, and then. As if he had strengthened his mind, song Daren gritted his teeth and rebuked him, and said in a loud voice, &ldquo;who is it?&rdquo; He opened the door fiercely.</p>
<p>Almost at the same time when the door was pushed open, the gray shadow flashed across the room, as if startled. He jumped from the table in the room to the bed. At the same time, he turned around and his eyes were rolling. He called out to the two people standing at the door of the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little ash!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren and Du Bishu called out at the same time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohui swallowed the fruit in his mouth, and then took a mountain fruit beside him. He bit half of it and ate it happily. In the Shoujing Hall of Dazhu peak, all the fruit cores are scattered all over the ground, which is quite funny compared with the solemn and solemn appearance of the past.</p>
<p>At the moment, all the people on Dazhu peak gathered here. Even Tian, who had always been in a bad temper, couldn&rsquo;t see the scene. He just frowned, but he didn&rsquo;t get angry. His face was gloomy, and he didn&rsquo;t know what he was thinking.</p>
<p>In the past ten years, everyone knows that Xiaohui has always been with that person and never separated. Now Xiaohui is here, but what about that person?</p>
<p>On that day, before the magic moon cave of Tongtian peak in Qingyun Mountain, song Daren and others witnessed the scene that the little younger martial brother who had once been severely damaged by Zhuxian ancient sword. After that, countless people hunted and killed him. Although there was no news of him since then, it was more vaguely heard that he had been rescued by his colleagues.</p>
<p>But why is Xiaohui here?</p>
<p>Xiaohui appeared, where is the man?</p>
<p>The same question, lingering in all people&rsquo;s minds, let people&rsquo;s hearts heavy. In the Shoujing hall, only Xiao Hui ate the fruit recklessly. In addition, he was very happy. He was quite different from the people around him!</p>
<p>chinese rhubarb.</p>
<p>The big dog was so excited at the moment that he ignored his owner&rsquo;s gloomy face. He barked and barked in his mouth. He kept turning around the table where Xiao Hui was lying. A bright rhubarb tail swayed and swayed around. He was very happy. From time to time, he would jump up his two feet in front of him and lie down beside the table. The dog&rsquo;s nose sniffed at Xiao Hui&rsquo;s body. Occasionally, he put out his tongue and licked Xiaohui a few times.</p>
<p>Xiao Hui cracked his mouth and laughed. He grabbed his head, grabbed an apple beside his hand, shook it in front of the big yellow face, and then threw it out to the outside of Shoujing hall. With a cry of &ldquo;Wang&rdquo;, rhubarb immediately jumped up and galloped out of the Shoujing hall. All the people were surprised and looked out. They saw that rhubarb actually caught the apple before it fell to the ground and caught it in the air. At the same time, he ran back immediately. As soon as the dog teeth loosened, the apple fell on the table and rolled several times.</p>
<p>All of them were dumbfounded, and Tian Bu Yi snorted.</p>
<p>Xiaohui chuckled and laughed. Obviously, he met his old dog friend. He was in a good mood. The monkey&rsquo;s tail rolled up and jumped off the table. However, it fell on the broad back of rhubarb and put his hand around rhubarb&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p>Rhubarb &ldquo;Wang Wang Wang Wang&rdquo; kept barking, raised his head and chest and ran out. I don&rsquo;t know where a monkey and a dog are going to play wild.</p>
<p>Song Daren looks at Tian Buyi and Su Ru, stands up and just wants to go out and chase back the two animals. However, Tian Bu Yi says coldly: &ldquo;let them go! The monkey has lived on this mountain for many years, and since he has come, he will not leave. &quot;</p>
<p>Song Daren answered and slowly sat down.</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi was silent for a moment and said, &ldquo;except for this monkey, you and Lao Liu have not seen other figures?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren and Du Bishu shook their heads at the same time and said, &ldquo;No</p>
<p>Tian is not easy to look ugly, suddenly waved his hand and said, &ldquo;OK, you go out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren and others looked at each other in awe, but the teacher&rsquo;s life was like a mountain, and they did not dare to disobey. They had to step back and go out. When he went out, he Dazhi asked Su Ru, &ldquo;Shiniang, do you want the disciples to clean this place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru has not yet said, field not easy already mildly angry way: &ldquo;say again tomorrow, ask you to go out to hear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He Dazhi was silent like a cold cicada. He retreated and disappeared in a twinkling of an eye.</p>
<p>Su Ru white field not easy one eye, way: &ldquo;nothing, you take them out of anger to do what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi, with a lot of thoughts on his face, walked back and forth, and suddenly raised his head and said to Su Ru, &ldquo;you said Lao Qi Is that man around here</p>
<p>Su Ru pondered for a moment and then said faintly, &ldquo;he is always the most emotional person. If you want to see you, it&rsquo;s reasonable. But in his capacity, most of them can&rsquo;t show up. &quot;</p>
<p>Tian is not easy to face a change, a fat face is uncertain, unspeakable strange.</p>
<p>Su Ru took a look at him, sighed and said, &ldquo;I know what you are worried about. Although he was injured by Zhuxian ancient sword, he did not die after all. Besides, it is said that his accomplice saved him? When they reported to us afterwards, they all said that the grey monkey was not at his side. In my opinion, maybe he knew the danger at that time, so he deliberately did not take the monkey with him. After he was seriously injured and fled, it was no surprise that the monkey wandered among the mountains and fields of Qingyun Mountain. It&rsquo;s not surprising that the monkey ran to us when he couldn&rsquo;t find his master. &quot;</p>
<p>The field is not easy to frown tightly, suddenly the mouth murmurs a, pour to like in scolding general.</p>
<p>Su Ru didn&rsquo;t hear clearly and asked, &ldquo;what do you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Field not easy but do not answer, hum a, eyebrow a exhibition, negative hand to walk backward hall. Su Ru looked at his back, shrugged his shoulders, rather helpless.</p>
<p>When she turned her head, suddenly, Tian Bu Yi called out in a low voice behind her. Su Ru was surprised. She turned her head to look at it and could not help smiling.</p>
<p>I saw that the field is not easy to look at the side of the heart, walking without looking at the ground, actually accidentally stepped on a nut, slipped. However, Tian Bu Yi is not a mortal after all. How he practices, he has already stabilized his body. Rao is so, Su Ru has already laughed.</p>
<p>Make a fool of himself in front of his wife, Tian is not easy to feel a lot of sweat, a face is a bit black, hate to scold: &ldquo;dead monkey, when will you peel off the skin, see you eat again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that, she went into the back hall without looking back. On the quiet hall full of nuts, Su Ru stood smiling. (to be continued. )</p>
