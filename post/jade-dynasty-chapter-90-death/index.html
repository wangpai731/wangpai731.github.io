      <p>The sky is gray, and it seems to be very low. There is a murky wind that doesn&rsquo;t know where it comes from. When it blows over the body, it makes people feel chilly.</p>
<p>There is a faint path between the marshes where there are many weeds. It extends to the inside.</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu and other disciples of Qingyun sect stood at the entrance of the death swamp and looked inside. They could only see the vast expanse of water and grass, and occasionally a solitary tree standing in it. There is a faint smell of decay in the air. Over the swamp, there is a haze like grey yarn. People can only see the nearby places, which is even more mysterious.</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu frowned and turned around. The thirteen young disciples of Qingyun sect, headed by Xiao Yicai, all looked dignified.</p>
<p>Since ancient times, the death of Ze has a bad reputation of &ldquo;difficult to get in and out&rdquo;. No one knows what evil things are in it. This time Qingyun sect came to the west, talking about Xiao Yicai&rsquo;s cultivation as a leader. Now he paid close attention to the deep place of the dead water for a long time, and quietly said to the people: &ldquo;yesterday, senior brother Li Xun of the burning incense Valley sent a letter to me, saying politely between the lines that they would eradicate the evils together with Qingyun sect, so they have entered the dead water first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a commotion behind him. Only Lu Xueqi, with a pale face, stood beside her elder martial sister Wen Min and gazed into the dead water. On the other side, Lin Jingyu snorted coldly.</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai said lightly: &ldquo;in fact, what do you mean by burning incense Valley? Everyone knows that if they take the unknown treasure first this time, their momentum will be naturally strong. In the future, some leaders will want to sit in turns.&rdquo; Speaking of this, he paused for a moment, then a smile appeared on the corner of his mouth, and said: &ldquo;but you don&rsquo;t have to worry. I expect that the strange omens appear early here, but no one has got the strange treasure until now. It can be seen that there must be many twists and turns in it. They are eager to work hard. They are free to go, but we need to be careful after entering the dead water. The death of Ze is notorious and unpredictable. And maybe there are demons and Demons here. After entering, everyone must take care of each other. Remember, remember. &quot;</p>
<p>Zeng Shu said: &ldquo;what elder martial brother Xiao said is. It&rsquo;s getting late. Let&rsquo;s go in, too! &quot;</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai nodded and said: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s OK.</p>
<p>After entering, we should not be too far away, and also, do not fall to the ground casually, so as not to be injured by poisonous insects, or fall into the bottomless swamp</p>
<p>Everyone nodded and Xiao Yicai waved his right hand to sacrifice the Seven Star fairy sword. Then, the disciples of Qingyun sect got up one after another, turned into dazzling lights of different colors of Taoism, and then left.</p>
<p>After a while, the group of young elites of Qingyun gate disappeared into the fog of death. In the open space at the entrance, there was a sudden silence. There was only a bubble between the water and the grass. The sound of &ldquo;gudu&rdquo; spread far away here.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pa&rdquo;, a heavy slap on his right neck on Monday. I saw a piece of red on my neck, but the mosquito that bit him was already buzzing away. It seemed that I had a happy turn in front of him, which made me fly away contentedly.</p>
<p>On Monday, the fairy face had a bitter color. From time to time, I saw a small bag bitten by insects, although it was not serious. But he looked very embarrassed. At the moment, he complained loudly in his mouth, saying: &ldquo;what the hell is this place? Where are so many damn mosquitoes coming from? This, this just one day&rsquo;s work, I was sucked half of the blood to go! &quot;</p>
<p>Walking in front of the small ring turned around, some worried, said: &ldquo;Grandpa, are you ok?&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Monday, the fairy said angrily, &ldquo;nonsense, do you think I have something to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan frowned: &ldquo;strange, these mosquitoes are really, how can they sting you alone? I have nothing to do with sister piner. &quot;</p>
<p>Standing beside Xiaohuan, the beautiful woman in yellow clothes stopped at the moment and looked back. She walked in the middle of the swamp with a small ring and Monday fairy. Monday fairy was very careful, but she was always a bit of clay and a bit of water mark. She seemed to be walking in the clouds and running water, and she didn&rsquo;t get any stains.</p>
<p>On Monday, the immortal was angry. He looked at a small tree nearby. Now he was careful to try it. The soil on the ground was hard. He sat down and said loudly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired of walking. I&rsquo;ll have a rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan is very sorry. She looks at the beautiful girl in yellow next to her. She calls her sister piner and smiles and says, &ldquo;it doesn&rsquo;t matter. Let&rsquo;s have a rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan looked at her gratefully, and then looked around. She saw a vast expanse of fields. A little farther away, there was a gradually thick fog. She couldn&rsquo;t really see it. If it wasn&rsquo;t for this bottle of elder sister to lead the way, she couldn&rsquo;t come in.</p>
<p>At this time, she couldn&rsquo;t help saying, &ldquo;sister, is it my grandpa and I that are dragging you down, or you will walk in the sky, not much faster?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman smiled and said, &ldquo;well, I&rsquo;m not on my way here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Small ring Zheng for a while, way: &ldquo;elder sister, you are not for your joy to send to rob this dead Ze of the different treasure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It turns out that this gorgeous girl in yellow is the Gold Vase with the same name as GUI Li and Qin Wuyan. I don&rsquo;t know how Xiao Huan and Zhou Yixian got to know this famous new generation of demon sect master.</p>
<p>But the gold bottle son obviously favors to the small ring, is dotes on very much, smells the speech to smile way: &ldquo;yes! But there are so many people coming this time. Let&rsquo;s take our time and not worry. &quot;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan is strange in her heart, but on reflection, she is supposed to be the secret of the Hehuan sect. If she doesn&rsquo;t want to go on, she turns to the topic and says, &ldquo;elder sister, we have been in the dead water for a day. I think you are very familiar with this road. Do you know the way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never been here in the future,&rdquo; said Jin Ping&rsquo;er, shaking his head</p>
<p>Xiaohuan is stunned.</p>
<p>When Jin pinger looked at her, he saw Xiaohuan&rsquo;s bright eyes full of doubts. He couldn&rsquo;t help laughing and said: &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve heard of the fragments of an ancient book that recorded all kinds of strange things and rare animals in the world&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan thought for a moment and said, &ldquo;is it not &lsquo;different spirits&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gold bottle son nodded and said, &ldquo;it is true that this book was written by a strange person in the ancient times. It is said that there are nine original chapters, but most of them have been lost. In addition to the &ldquo;spirit and beast chapter&rdquo; and &ldquo;essence and monster chapter&rdquo; handed down, there is also a fragmented volume of &ldquo;landscape chapter&rdquo;, which I accidentally got. At the end of it, there are some records in the dead water here. &quot;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan understood this, but she didn&rsquo;t wait for her to say anything. On the other side, there was another crisp sound on the immortal part on Monday. Then I heard that the immortal on Monday swore loudly. Most of them were bitten by some unknown mosquito and sucked blood.</p>
<p>Xiaohuan and he are granddaughters. They care. Then I thought that although there were many mosquitoes along the way, they were harmless to themselves and jinpinger, only biting on Monday fairy. There must be something strange in the middle. Naturally, I didn&rsquo;t have this ability. Then it fell on the gold bottle.</p>
<p>Now she turned around and looked at the Golden Vase. The Golden Vase smiled and said, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter, sister?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan smiled bitterly and said: &ldquo;elder sister, my grandfather Well, I know you have a lot of powers. Why don&rsquo;t you help him? &quot;</p>
<p>The gold bottle son looked to the Monday fairy, in the eye has the disdain.</p>
<p>But turned to see the small ring pleading eyes, shrugged his shoulders, said: &ldquo;just, look at your face, on the cheap him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took out a white jade bottle from his arms and handed it to Xiao Huan. He said, &ldquo;there are some potions in the bottle. Ask him to smear them on his body. Mosquitoes will naturally avoid them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan takes it happily, smiling. &ldquo;Thank you, sister.&rdquo; After that, he quickly went to the side of Monday immortal and handed him the bottle. After a moment&rsquo;s pause, he suddenly jumped up. &ldquo;There is such a good thing, you don&rsquo;t&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jinpinger&rsquo;s face turned cold and stared at the past. On Monday, Xiandeng had no voice. It seemed that there was something wrong with her. She lowered her head and took the bottle. Pour out the liquid medicine and smear it on the whole body. After a while, I only feel a fragrance. As expected, the mosquito that was flying around just now did not make a sound. The whole body and mind relaxed.</p>
<p>Xiaohuan slowly walked back, handed the bottle back to jinpinger, hesitated for a moment, and whispered, &ldquo;elder sister, do you still remember what my grandfather did wrong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hum!&rdquo; Jinpinger&rsquo;s face was a little cold, and said: &ldquo;three years ago, on the edge of the East China Sea, he made a lot of nonsense, but he almost put me in a place of eternal death. If it wasn&rsquo;t for your sister, you would have lost a year&rsquo;s life, and played a&rdquo; soul gathering array &ldquo;for me. Besides the spirits attached to me, I would not have been as dead at this moment. If it wasn&rsquo;t for old Pifu</p>
<p>Xiaohuan gently pulls on the hand of jinpinger and whispers, &ldquo;elder sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jinpinger looked at her and sighed a little. Then he smiled and his eyes were full of love. He patted her on the palm and said, &ldquo;well, well, with your good sister, I&rsquo;ve already put down my previous work. But sometimes I don&rsquo;t like your Grandpa very much. I can&rsquo;t help asking him to suffer. Ha ha, good sister, don&rsquo;t you blame me</p>
<p>Xiaohuan smiles and shakes her head.</p>
<p>Gold bottle son is smiling to want to say, suddenly face a cold, turn round quickly, drink a way: &ldquo;what person?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan and Monday fairy were shocked. Looking around, they saw a vast fog and lush water. Apart from the occasional blisters on the water, they didn&rsquo;t move at all.</p>
<p>But somehow, looking at jinpinger&rsquo;s always calm face, she suddenly dignified and cautious at the moment. On the contrary, when talking and laughing with Xiaohuan, she was gentle and quiet, and revealed her murderous intention in calmness, as if she had changed her personality, as if she was a strong enemy that could not be ignored.</p>
<p>A moment later, in the deep fog of the distance, a voice came suddenly, and said softly: &ldquo;golden fairy, I&rsquo;ve made an appointment to meet in the&rdquo; black ditch &ldquo;yesterday to discuss major issues. Why don&rsquo;t you come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the moment, jinpinger seems to know who the visitor is. His face is slightly relaxed, but his eyes are alert, and his voice is not polite. He says coldly, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man in the fog seemed to be smothering for a while, but he didn&rsquo;t speak for a long time. After a long time, he said, &ldquo;what do you mean by the golden fairy? Is there no interest in the party?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jin Ping&rsquo;er snorted, looked ahead, and said, &ldquo;three days ago, four disciples of Hehuan sect were killed at six li in the northwest of Dawang village. They were poisoned by black toad powder, but your hands?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man in the fog seemed to be stunned for a moment and said, &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The black toad powder is owned by the ten thousand poisons sect alone,&rdquo; said the gold bottle son coldly</p>
<p>The man in the fog didn&rsquo;t speak. After a long silence, he said lightly, &ldquo;if I do, I don&rsquo;t need to use poison at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Golden Vase son hummed again, but did not refute, obviously on this point, there is no objection.</p>
<p>The man said again: &ldquo;but since it&rsquo;s about you and me, and it&rsquo;s about me, I&rsquo;ll give you a statement when I&rsquo;m here. What do you think? There are many strange things in this visit to the west, I&rsquo;m afraid there are other ways. I hope you will consider it carefully and focus on the major issues. &quot;</p>
<p>Gold bottle son slightly frowns, ponders for a moment, turns. To Xiaohuan: &ldquo;Xiaohuan sister, you and your grandfather will have a rest here for a while. I will go to the front to discuss something with others and come back before dark.&rdquo; After a pause, she lowered her voice. &ldquo;The thing I gave you, are you still there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan nodded and clapped her left hand.</p>
<p>Jinpinger smiled, took her hand, and said softly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not far in front of you. If you have anything, I&rsquo;ll be there in an instant. It&rsquo;s just that you should never walk around, especially away from here. &quot;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan nodded, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t worry, sister. I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Golden Vase smiled. Let go, said: &ldquo;you are all careful, something call me is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, she looked around again, and then her body suddenly soared into the air. Under her clothes, there was a purple glow, holding her beautiful figure, and she flew forward into the thick fog.</p>
<p>Xiao Huan looks at the figure of Jin Ping&rsquo;er disappearing in the fog, then turns around and walks to the side of Zhou Xian.</p>
<p>At the moment, on Monday, the fairy leaned against the small tree, without the harassment of mosquitoes, and suddenly had a lot of leisure. I won&rsquo;t come. &quot;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan said with a smile, &ldquo;no one forces you to come. It&rsquo;s not what you want to keep up with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Monday, the fairy snorted, and then said to Xiaohuan, &ldquo;I said, you&rsquo;d better stay away from that woman. In recent years, you haven&rsquo;t heard that it&rsquo;s said that she killed countless people, and at the same time, she&rsquo;s very libertine. Seduced countless good young men&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>Xiao Huan gave a poo and said, &ldquo;Grandpa, how can you say that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Monday, Xian vomited his tongue, but didn&rsquo;t go on.</p>
<p>The two of them are waiting here, seeing the gloomy sky gradually darkening, but jinpinger still hasn&rsquo;t come back. Xiaohuan is worried slowly, and wants to go to the front to have a look, but he is afraid of jinpinger&rsquo;s explanation, and he doesn&rsquo;t have any confidence, so he doesn&rsquo;t dare to go.</p>
<p>After waiting for a while, Xiaohuan was upset. She looked up at the sky, but saw that the clouds were getting thicker. It looked like this, not only that it was going to be dark, but that it was going to rain for the most part.</p>
<p>Xiaohuan suddenly lost her voice and cried. She remembered that she was in a hurry when she came. She had brought everything with her, but she forgot the rain gear. It&rsquo;s not bad if it rains at this time. &ldquo;Grandpa, do you have an umbrella?&rdquo; he asked</p>
<p>&ldquo;Umbrella?&rdquo; said the immortal on Monday A moment later, he immediately understood and looked up at the sky. For a moment, he was dumb and said, &ldquo;I, I thought you took it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Huan said in a hurry: &ldquo;ah! This is terrible. What can I do if it rains? &quot;</p>
<p>On Monday, the immortal looked around, and saw that there was only a small tree behind him, and the rest were pond plants. There was no place for shelter from the rain. He could not help crying: &ldquo;this is over. Let&rsquo;s find a place to shelter from the rain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan immediately shook her head and said, &ldquo;no, sister piner said, we can&rsquo;t walk around, or there will be danger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhou Yixian has no good airway: &ldquo;can&rsquo;t you go? We can&rsquo;t wait for the rain to come down. We are afraid of the risk of tuberculosis! &quot;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan is also frowning at the moment. She is in a hurry. Suddenly, there is a slight sound in front of her, but the sound of footsteps comes. Xiaohuan&rsquo;s heart was very happy. She almost blurted out a sound of &ldquo;sister piner&rdquo;, but suddenly she closed her mouth. I saw a figure walking out of the dense fog in front of me. It seemed that there was a small shadow behind me. At the same time, there was a familiar complaint.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had eight lives of bad luck with you, Taoist. I&rsquo;m afraid to go to this ghost place and get bitten by mosquitoes. Why don&rsquo;t you tell him to suck up my blood?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Squeak, squeak&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan is stunned. It&rsquo;s not someone else. It&rsquo;s the wild dog Taoist who has seen his face in Dawang village. However, it&rsquo;s the monkey Xiaohui who jumps behind him. Only the ghost is missing.</p>
<p>The wild dog Taoist walked and looked at him. But he saw Xiaohuan and Monday immortal standing in front of him. He looked at himself strangely and was surprised. He said, &ldquo;eh? You are not those two people who look at each other. How can you be here? &quot;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan hasn&rsquo;t answered yet. The little grey eyes behind the wild dog recognize that the woman in front is a familiar person. She squeaked twice, and then she jumped to Xiaohuan.</p>
<p>When Xiaohuan saw it, she immediately showed her face and smiled, bent over and picked up Xiaohui. She didn&rsquo;t care about Xiaohui&rsquo;s coming. She was dirty on her hands and feet. She smiled, &ldquo;Why are you here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohui seemed to understand her words, grinning, and then he pointed back at Xiaohuan, and kept talking to Xiaohuan.</p>
<p>Xiaohuan naturally doesn&rsquo;t understand its meaning, but it seems to guess that Xiaohui means that ghost Li is right in front of her. She moves in her heart and wonders if elder sister piner can&rsquo;t meet ghost Li?</p>
<p>In her hesitation, she only heard a sudden explosion of thunder in the sky, which spread for a while. After a while, the sound of &ldquo;crash&rdquo; was loud, and the heavy rain of beans dropped.</p>
<p>Xiaohuan screams, covers her head with her hands, and runs to Monday fairy subconsciously with Xiaohui in her arms. &ldquo;Grandpa, what can I do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Zhou Yixian also smiled bitterly, but also simply turned his shirt over his head and said, &ldquo;no way, no way to go, no place to hide, let&rsquo;s get wet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan is mute, only to see the sky and the ground. The sky is gray and misty. The rain is getting bigger and bigger. In a second, her shoulders are half wet. Her white skin is shining and moving. At the moment, the monkey Xiaohui is also honest. She huddles in a huddle and curls up in Xiaohuan&rsquo;s arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haha!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly, a few laughs came from the side. Xiaohuan looked at it in a flash, but the wild dog Taoist was not in a hurry. He took an umbrella out of a package behind him and propped it up. He looked very proud. (to be continued. )</p>
