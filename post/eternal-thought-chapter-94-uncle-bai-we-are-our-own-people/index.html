      <p>&ldquo;This battle of pride Ah On the terrace, the headmaster Zheng Yuandong shook his head helplessly. All the mountain leaders around him laughed bitterly.</p>
<p>They all know that this should be serious Tianjiao battle, now has completely changed the flavor Originally good, because more a white small pure, directly rancid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bai Xiaochun His name is very good, but it&rsquo;s not pure at all Zhou Changlao smiles bitterly, looking at Bai Xiaochun hiding in the crowd below, and the countless crazy disciples on the north bank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter. Since Bai Xiaochun is so naughty, he has become a public enemy among the disciples on the north bank. If we find a chance to throw him to the north bank, I think we can stop a lot of it.&rdquo; The speaker is the palm seat of iris peak on the north bank. This is an old woman&rsquo;s mouth with a smile.</p>
<p>All the people were moved. When they were thinking, only Li Qinghou&rsquo;s eyes showed sympathy and glanced at the palm seat of iris peak. He knew Bai Xiaochun too well. He could be sure that if Bai Xiaochun was thrown to the north bank, it was not Bai Xiaochun who was in bad luck</p>
<p>Just when everyone was thinking, the third fight of the third round began.</p>
<p>Ghost tooth vs. Xu Song, Shangguan Tianyou vs. Gongsun Waner, these two battles have no much to look at at at all. They can win easily with their strong performance before ghost teeth and Shangguan Tianyou.</p>
<p>All the disciples on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, including the leader of the terrace and others, all set their eyes on the third area. Gongsun Yun was the first one to come forward. His whole body was full of coldness. From a distance, he looked at Bai Xiaochun, who was a master and came to the stage.</p>
<p>This time, the north bank didn&rsquo;t roar, but the eyes that wanted to kill each other gathered tens of thousands of murderous spirit on Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s body, which made Bai Xiaochun scared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give up.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun takes a deep breath and looks at gongsunyun. He holds the estrus pill in his hand and opens his mouth quickly.</p>
<p>Gongsun Yun looked at Bai Xiaochun coldly, and his eyes showed disgust. As soon as the big sleeve swung, countless black beetles flew out of his sleeve. Even since his clothes, along with his body, there were a large number of red centipedes crawling out, covering the ground around him in a blink of an eye.</p>
<p>Those insects and poisonous insects are dense enough to make people startled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Although there are male and female insects, they are not animals. Your pills are useless to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Gongsun Yun calmly opened his mouth, he did not give Bai Xiaochun a chance to continue to speak. He felt a move, and immediately the insects around him gave out stinging tinnitus, and rushed out like a sea of insects and went straight to Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>Those centipedes on the ground quickly approaching, and those black beetles, actually all fly up, cover the sky, rushed to Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>Every insect in this sea of insects has a certain attack power. Although the light of protection can be resisted for a while, he is most afraid of such intensive attacks. Even Bai Xiaochun can imagine that his protection does not have much advantage in the face of Gongsun Yun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gongsunyun, don&rsquo;t force me to give up. I really don&rsquo;t want to continue to fight. Once I do, you You will be useless White small pure complexion is pale, rapid retreat, hastily shout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see if your flesh and blood are swallowed up first, or I will be wasted as you said.&rdquo; Gongsun Yun sneered at him with more contempt in his eyes. When he waved his hand, more insects emerged from him.</p>
<p>This scene makes people on the south bank feel numb. When they look at Gongsun Yun, they are all shocked. They have a deep understanding of Gongsun&rsquo;s toughness. He is not only good at insect and insect insects, but also has amazing skills. He can resist a finger of ghost tooth. Even if Shangguan Tianyou fights him, he needs three swords and consumes a lot.</p>
<p>The people on the north bank were so excited and excited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brother Gongsun, nice to kill Bai Xiaochun!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha ha, Bai Xiaochun, I&rsquo;ll see how you resist this time. Wait. Those insects will soon penetrate into your body and devour your flesh and blood!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bai Xiaochun, you also have today Countless north shore disciples were excited, and the countless war animals around them seemed to feel the excitement of their master and roared in succession.</p>
<p>In the twinkling of an eye, those black beetles rushed to Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s face and covered with the light of protection. When they kept biting, the protection light was rapidly dim to the naked eye.</p>
<p>Those red centipedes, also followed, jumped up from the ground, making the protection light dim and faster. Even these centipedes were weird, and many of them were fast drilling into the light curtain.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s scalp was numb and his eyes were red. He roared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gongsun Yun, you forced me!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun was also helpless. He didn&rsquo;t want to launch the assassin&rsquo;s mace, but now he had no choice but to sigh. He jumped up innocently in the bottom of his heart. The light of his whole body suddenly shook, shaking away many insects and insects covered in it. When they were about to rush again, he took the estrus pill in his right hand and threw it towards the direction of the north bank disciple.</p>
<p>Whoosh, this pill is very fast. Before people can wait for their reaction, they arrive in the air of the disciples on the north bank. All the disciples are in a daze. When they look up, they hear a low roar from Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bang!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a bang, the estrus pill collapsed and exploded in an instant. It turned into countless fly ash and spread around, directly covering the disciples on the North Bank of the small part of the area.</p>
<p>Gongsun Yun suddenly opened his eyes in surprise.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun really doesn&rsquo;t know if this pill has any effect on human beings. He has made so many strange pills that he dare not try one of them. However, he knows how strong the stimulation is to the fierce beast.</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, all the war animals in the area covered by the oestrus pill, one by one, roared wildly, their bodies swelled, their eyes turned red, and their heavy breathing immediately made their owners scream and retreat rapidly.</p>
<p>Suddenly, all the disciples on the north bank retreated like crazy one by one, and soon there was no one in this area. There was only one statue roaring around. It looked like a fierce beast looking for the target. All the disciples on the north bank were in a uproar, and tens of thousands of people were scattered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bai Xiaochun Almost all the disciples on the north bank uttered sharp sounds. When the earth was shaking, Gongsun Yun&rsquo;s forehead was sweating. His constitution had never sweated after practicing insect poison.</p>
<p>But at the moment, he was short of breath. He watched Bai Xiaochun take out another pill in his hand not far away. Obviously, those fierce animals became agitated immediately after the pill appeared. This immediately made Gongsun Yun think of the pills broken on beihanlie&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A strong bad feeling suddenly appeared in Gongsun Yun&rsquo;s heart. His heart was shaking, and countless pictures appeared in his mind. At the moment, he retreated rapidly, and even his legs trembled. He could imagine that once Bai Xiaochun threw the pill to himself, the next moment They will be directly attacked by many war beasts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You forced me, and I don&rsquo;t want to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun was about to throw out the pills with a sad face and a sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I give up!&rdquo; Gongsun Yun made a shrill voice that he had never heard in his life. His face was white, his body suddenly retreated, and he almost ran away. He rushed into the crowd. It seemed that he was too frightened. When he looked at Bai Xiaochun, he had an unprecedented fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah?&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun was stunned. He looked at Gongsun Yun, who was hiding in the crowd, and looked at the irascible war animals. He felt something was wrong.</p>
<p>Especially those war beasts, at the moment, there are so many roaring, staring at the pills in Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s hands, and they are already moving forward. Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s forehead is sweating. He quickly looks at the place where the disciples of the north bank are.</p>
<p>Hua, where he looked, the disciples on the north bank were all frightened. They didn&rsquo;t dare to go out and roar at Bai Xiaochun. In an instant, they scattered.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun was worried and looked at other places. However, all the areas he looked at were scattered in an instant, and there were endless shouts of crowding.</p>
<p>At the end, Bai Xiaochun anxiously looked back at the disciples on the south bank.</p>
<p>The moment All the people on the south bank felt numb and retreated together. In the blink of an eye, they all retreated dozens of Zhang.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle Bai, we are our own people! My own people There are still a lot of people who cry out in a hurry.</p>
<p>Even the ghost teeth and Shangguan Tianyou, at the moment, all face a big change, quickly retreat.</p>
<p>Roar! Those irascible war beasts, at the moment, have a lot of front, one by one red eyes, see white small pure forehead sweat more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How to do, how to do, I said, let you admit defeat, I once shot myself are afraid!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun is innocent and looks at the north bank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which of you just said you wanted to offer me a reward!&rdquo;</p>
<p>People on the north bank instantly bowed their heads. None of them dared to look at Bai Xiaochun. Their hearts were trembling.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s heart also trembled. He felt that he was a kind-hearted man. He could not throw away the pills in his hand. When he was worried, he saw that the fighting animals were becoming more and more irritable. Suddenly, Bai Xiaochun saw the old phoenix with a circumference in the sky, still proud and proud.</p>
<p>As soon as her eyes were bright, Bai Xiaochun had no time to think about it. She threw the pill in her hand towards the Phoenix. The pill turned into a rainbow and went straight to the old phoenix.</p>
<p>This phoenix is gloating, did not pay attention to the pill flying, when it is aware of, the whole body feathers are blown up, issued a shrill scream, was about to dodge, bang, the pill burst, countless powder stained all over.</p>
<p>The Phoenix stayed for a while, and then, the war animals below, one by one, roared wildly, all with hot eyes, as if to rush to the sky to chase the Phoenix.</p>
<p>Even the leader on the terrace and others all took a breath. They all stood up to the edge and looked at it in a daze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This one&rsquo;s hand to the bystander Did you break the rules? &quot; I don&rsquo;t know which elder subconsciously opened his mouth, but I found that other people didn&rsquo;t pay attention to it, especially the three palm seats left at the moment on the north bank were all looking at Lu qimang. What they saw was one of the many war beasts in the empty area!</p>
<p>It was a deer like war beast, which was also roaring now, obviously with the intention of oestrus. At the moment, it was roaring at the Phoenix in the sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before this pill, I thought that even if it had some effects, it could only affect the third level blood vessels I didn&rsquo;t expect that even the second-order blood can be effective! &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This Dan In this way, it will be of great use to my north shore! &quot; All the three palms on the north bank were shocked and excited. The old woman raised her right hand and pointed to the Phoenix.</p>
<p>In a flash, the bird trembled and was covered by a strong force. When it went straight to the high platform, the old woman pressed it in front of him. At the same time, some of the war beasts below roared one by one, and some flew up and went straight to the terrace.</p>
<p>The old woman snorted coldly, and her eyes fell down. The fierce beasts howled and were swept by a strong force. However, none of them remained. All of them were rolled up, and their bodies shrank one by one. In a flash, they were put into the old woman&rsquo;s cuffs.</p>
<p>The old woman looked at the Phoenix with a sad face, but she didn&rsquo;t dare to roar. After a careful look, she saw a surprise in her eyes and immediately communicated with other palm seats.</p>
<p>One side of the perimeter is old, his face is blue</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun was relieved when he saw that he was all right. When he was about to retreat, all of a sudden, those disciples on the north bank were oppressed by coercion, and then burst out a roar of anger, which had to be strong for countless times.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bai Xiaochun, I will kill you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bai Xiaochun, we are at odds with you on the north bank!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God kill Bai Xiaochun On the north bank, countless people&rsquo;s brows were bulging. When they roared, Bai Xiaochun turned around, raised his right hand, took out an ordinary pill, held it high and raised his chin.</p>
<p>The moment All the disciples on the north bank trembled and stopped immediately.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun threw the pill in his breath and quickly got off the stage. Then, he left behind him The sound of anger on the north bank is earth shaking.</p>
