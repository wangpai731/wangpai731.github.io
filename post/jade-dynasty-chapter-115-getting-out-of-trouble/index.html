      <p>XuanHuo altar</p>
<p>The majestic and almost indestructible huge altar suddenly began to shake violently. Nine Tailed Tianhu and Xiaohui, who are on the third floor of xuanhuotan, are all shaken aside by this sudden huge force. But after all, they are all psychic animals, and soon they are stable.</p>
<p>In the dark depth of the front, the dark red light gradually brightened up, showing a ghostly figure.</p>
<p>The XuanHuo chain, which is bound to the waist of the Nine Tailed Tianhu, gradually becomes bright from the deep dark red color to the bright color. From afar, it seems that there is a feeling of flame flowing in the strange iron.</p>
<p>Nine tail sky fox low hum, eyes seem to have a trace of pain look. Standing beside it, Xiaohui looks at Jiuwei Tianhu, then looks at the shadow in the dark.</p>
<p>The dark red light is brighter, reflecting the stone platform in front of Guili. Xuanhuojian is placed on the stone platform by the ghost. In the dark, there seems to be a silent shouting, like anger, like roaring!</p>
<p>The ancient Fire Totem in the center of xuanhuojian, flickering slowly, like fire burning!</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Suddenly, a loud noise came from their feet, and a flash of hot air rushed up from under the XuanHuo altar, turning the originally cold three layers into a red flame place.</p>
<p>Countless huge ice around began to melt and decompose. The ice crystals that originally sparkled with beautiful blue light still sparkled before disappearing, mapping the surrounding areas bright and dark.</p>
<p>The whole space presents a rare spectacle between the roar of heat wave and the silent dance of ice. Xiaohui turned around, blinked three eyes, grinned and couldn&rsquo;t turn his eyes. However, Jiuwei Tianhu seemed to ignore the hot and cold wonders behind him. A pair of fox eyes were just staring at the ghost beside the red light in the dark.</p>
<p>As the strange light on the Fire Totem gradually brightens, the huge dark fire chain starts to make a &ldquo;click&rdquo; sound, and the light on the chain itself is also brighter now, which seems to be burning. At the same time, the color of pain in the eyes of the Nine Tailed Tianhu is heavier, even the fur around its waist in the XuanHuo chain. Even there is a trend of becoming scorched yellow.</p>
<p>The temperature around is getting higher and higher. The altar at the foot starts to roar at some time. It sounds like a raging volcano magma.</p>
<p>And in this strange time of roaring and flashing lights.</p>
<p>Nine tail sky fox suddenly body a shock, fox head fierce turn, it is to leave it has been staring at the ghost, looking back.</p>
<p>That distant place, in this surging, momentum beyond the noise. As if there was a long roar, with great anger and consternation, flying at full speed!</p>
<p>Jiuwei Tianhu&rsquo;s face changed greatly. His eyes suddenly became very anxious. He suddenly turned around and was about to say something</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>A muffled sound, at this moment.</p>
<p>The stone platform in front of Guili&rsquo;s body, under the effect of the strange power of xuanhuojian, made a dull loud sound, as if with a trace of reluctance. Slowly sink down. And the xuanhuojian also slowly floats from the stone platform, moves to the mid air, emitting pure and red light.</p>
<p>With the fall of the stone platform, the surrounding stone walls began to shake gradually, and a deep crack began to appear, followed by a second one. At the same time, the XuanHuo chain, which was deeply embedded in the stone wall, began to shake, which became violent rapidly. Finally, when the seventh crack appeared on the stone wall, it made a loud noise. The once indestructible XuanHuo chain, like a dead snake losing its life, lost all its luster and fell to the ground from the waist of the Nine Tailed Tianhu.</p>
<p>The Nine Tailed Fox is between ice and fire, darkness and light. Roar to the sky!</p>
<p>The voice was bleak and distant, far away spread away, and finally with the foot of the angry volcano roar integration, high and constant!</p>
<p>At that moment, it seemed to be the power of infuriated flames, and the surging heat waves under the feet of all the people roared at the same time. A huge sound was heard from the foot, and in a moment there were countless cracks on the hard stone slab under the feet of all the people.</p>
<p>Guili grabs xuanhuojian back, receives it in his arms, and walks back quickly. Xiaohui squeaked twice and jumped to his shoulder.</p>
<p>In the whole body of the Nine Tailed sky fox, white smoke quickly gathered and instantly became thick, covering its white body. After a while, a strange &ldquo;wordy&rdquo; sound came out, gradually showing a human shape under the white gas constantly eroded by the increasingly hot heat wave around.</p>
<p>The white jade like hand is faintly and transparently illuminated by the blazing fire, as if it can see the thin blood flowing gently. The smooth shoulders are round without any flaw, and the subtle ups and downs are like gentle peaks, which are so mysterious and incompatible in this violent world.</p>
<p>The ghost could not see the face of the figure clearly, and had no time to see it again.</p>
<p>As if they could not resist the eruption at last, the volcano that had been sleeping for countless times had erupted. At their feet, the earth vibrated violently, and everything fell down. The air was so hot that it would burn, even breathing in it was like a flame.</p>
<p>The huge roar came out from the bottom of the earth, and the fragile slate collapsed and fell in an instant. In the flash of blue light, the face of the ghost is grim. It rises in the air. In the white air of the Nine Tailed Tianhu, its voice comes out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost Li didn&rsquo;t think much about it. He flew to the sky. It wasn&rsquo;t for a moment. The original hard stone wall on his head collapsed and smashed down. The ghost Li tried to avoid rushing up in the space falling like rain. The little ash squeaked and tightly grasped the skirt of the ghost Li. And the Nine Tailed Fox is shrouded in a white gas, and it rushes up to the sky closely following the spirit.</p>
<p>At the foot, the fiery magma broke through all the barriers in a flash, such as a huge pillar of fire rushing up to the sky and chasing after them.</p>
<p>The whole burning incense valley was enveloped in a blazing flame and red light, and all people looked at it in horror, a huge pillar of fire rising from the sky.</p>
<p>Even the black clouds in the sky are permeated by the great power of the earth!</p>
<p>From the center of the pillar of fire, the black cloud in the sky has completely changed into the flame color, just like the whole sky, has changed into a burning sea of fire.</p>
<p>A moment later, the burning ashes, huge stones and ashes fall from the world, or dark, or burning, like a sad rain of the end!</p>
<p>No one can see the figure of GUI Li and Nine Tailed Tianhu. The red eye carving, which was originally released for patrolling in the sky, is now escaping death. Where can we go for tracking.</p>
<p>For a while, in addition to the occasional screams, the people in the burning incense valley were silent. Even the fishermen were awed by the power of the world.</p>
<p>Only at the end of the pillar, under the XuanHuo altar, people heard a furious voice from afar, roaring!</p>
<p>Far away. The huge and terrible pillar of fire has disappeared, and the earth has gradually calmed down, but there is still a huge black hole in the sky. The clouds around the black hole also seem to be scorched by the flame, showing a strange golden color.</p>
<p>After flying far away from the burning incense Valley, GUI Li fell down on the top of a remote hill, where the trees are luxuriant. Even the people in the burning incense Valley want to follow him. I have to find it for half a day. What&rsquo;s more, the surrounding area of the burning Valley is so large, and it&rsquo;s not so easy for the burning Valley to track them.</p>
<p>He fell to the ground, the blue light flashed back, and then heard that the Nine Tailed sky fox behind him also fell to the ground. GUI Li did not turn around and stood still.</p>
<p>There is no sound behind.</p>
<p>After a moment, ghost sharp light way: &ldquo;do you need clothes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why, the voice behind me suddenly has a light and flowing soft meaning: &ldquo;well, thank you very much, young master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ghost Li took off his coat and threw it back. In the middle, he didn&rsquo;t turn his body all the time, but the little ash lying on his shoulder didn&rsquo;t look like his master at all. He turned his head around, looked at the devil for a while, looked back for a while, and scratched his head with his hands from time to time. It seemed that he was puzzled.</p>
<p>The sound of light and thin clothing is particularly clear in the silent forest. In the night, which was illuminated by the strange clouds in the sky, it gradually darkened again.</p>
<p>So far away, but still feel the night wind, with a trace of heat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young man. Yes. &quot; The voice of the woman behind me is quiet.</p>
<p>Ghost Li didn&rsquo;t turn around at once, but still stood still for a moment, which turned slowly.</p>
<p>A woman in his coat stood in the night, in the woods. In front of him.</p>
<p>Her figure is graceful and slender, even if it is not fit clothes still can not cover her beautiful figure. For her, the clothes seemed a little broad, draped on her body and tied her coat lapel, but they still couldn&rsquo;t cover the gaps and exposed light white skin. In such a night, it seemed that there was a faint temptation.</p>
<p>Her lips are soft, her eyes are beautiful, her nose is delicate, her eyebrows are graceful. Her appearance is like the gentle water that will flow to you and make you intoxicated; it is also like the beauty that has been in the red face for thousands of years, but it is more gorgeous and beautiful after the wind and snow.</p>
<p>The ghost was silent. After a while, he turned his head.</p>
<p>Xiaohui squatted on the ground, looked at the host standing on the side and looked at the distance. Guili had been looking at the sky since just now, and didn&rsquo;t know what he was thinking?</p>
<p>White hands stretched out, little gray looked back, grinned, stretched out his monkey paw, under the gray hair, his fingers looked longer than human&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Nine Tailed sky fox transformed into a human shape of this woman, gently squatting down in front of the monkey, skirt light movement, there is a faint spring shaking.</p>
<p>She smiled quietly and looked at Xiaohui with interest. Then she stretched out her jade like hand and held Xiaohui&rsquo;s fingers gently.</p>
<p>Little ash squeaked and laughed.</p>
<p>Her eyes seemed to be full of smiles, and she said softly, &ldquo;I want to thank you, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little gray blinked and nodded all of a sudden. He looked very proud.</p>
<p>The woman laughed, reached out to hold the ash in her arms, stood up, and walked slowly to the side of GUI Li.</p>
<p>Look up at the distant mountain covered by the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three hundred years,&rdquo; she said slowly after a long time, &ldquo;three hundred years&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ghost Li turned to look at her, she was staring at the distance, nestled in her arms little ash somehow, very quiet, eyes looking at ghost Li.</p>
<p>From the side, her face soft curve, as if there is a trace of inexplicable strength.</p>
<p>She was silent for a long time, then suddenly sighed, shook her head, turned her head towards the ghost, smiled a little.</p>
<p>That beauty, like a lily blooming in the dark!</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are you going to prepare in the future?&rdquo; said the ghost</p>
<p>Nine tail day fox smiled, as if also some perplexed, softly way: &ldquo;you small six self commit place tell me carefully.&rdquo;. I&rsquo;d like to go there if I have a chance in the future. &quot;</p>
<p>Guili lowered his head, and his eyes seemed to flash with light. Then he said: &ldquo;it is a place called Xiaochi town near the northern kongsang mountain. There is a small forest ten miles away from the town. There is a black stone hole in the forest. The deepest part of the hole is that. It will not be difficult to find.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nine tail day fox indifferent smile, nodded.</p>
<p>Ghost Li looked at her, as if hesitated for a moment, but then reached into his arms. Take out the xuanhuojian.</p>
<p>In the night, the ancient Fire Totem on the xuanhuojian is slightly glowing.</p>
<p>Reflected in the eyes of Nine Tailed Tianhu, it seems like two small flames.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This.&rdquo; Ghost Li looked at the XuanHuo Jian in his hand and sent it to him. &ldquo;Give it back to you, it&rsquo;s your son&rsquo;s thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nine tail day fox a Zheng, can&rsquo;t help but raise an eye to see him more. Slowly, he took XuanHuo Jian over and played with it for a few times. Suddenly he said: &ldquo;do you know that XuanHuo Jian is the supreme artifact in the world, the essence of all fires. If you can really master its power usage, and then cooperate with the &ldquo;eight fierce XuanHuo array&rdquo; you see in the XuanHuo altar, it will have the power of destroying the sky and destroying the earth. &quot;</p>
<p>She smiled, looked at the ghost, said: &ldquo;even if so, you also give it back to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ghost Li looked at the treasure in her hand lightly, silent for a moment.</p>
<p>Slowly turned around, whispered: &ldquo;what do I want it to do? What do I want to do to destroy the sky? I want it. It can&rsquo;t be given to me&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>Jiuwei Tianhu looks at Guili, but he doesn&rsquo;t speak for a long time. His eyes are as deep as water.</p>
<p>Suddenly, she smiled, with three hundred years of vicissitudes and sadness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well said, well said!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at her with a smile on her face. Between the eyebrows and eyes, it is bleak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the past three hundred years, I haven&rsquo;t seen the sun in XuanHuo altar. I don&rsquo;t know how many times I have thought about why I lost my mind to steal this XuanHuo Jian? These three hundred years. It would be nice if I had a happy time with my family&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>She laughed loudly. Her face was full of the beauty of the vicissitudes of life. She raised her hand and threw xuanhuojian over.</p>
<p>Ghost Li catch, Zheng for a while. &ldquo;This is what your whole family paid for with their lives. How do you&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nine Tailed Tianhu slowly stopped laughing, but the sad color in his eyes was even more heavy, low and secluded:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do I want it for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ghost Li subconsciously grasped the xuanhuojian in his hand and felt the warmth from it. A moment later, he said, &ldquo;you have been imprisoned by the burning incense Valley for three hundred years. Don&rsquo;t want to revenge?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nine tail sky fox light way: &ldquo;think, of course. I&rsquo;ve been thinking about it all these three hundred years. But I just got out of poverty, and now I&rsquo;m looking at the night, the vast world, and suddenly I can&rsquo;t get up the spirit to revenge. &quot;</p>
<p>She looked up and saw the vast world, smiled and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been so stupid to waste my time on this boring magic weapon for hundreds of years. Now let me have more comfortable days in this world. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you may use it later. After all, xuanhuojian is still your son&hellip;&rdquo; said the ghost</p>
<p>Nine Tailed Tianhu smiled and said: &ldquo;Xiaoliu? Didn&rsquo;t he give it to you already? And&hellip; &quot; She looked at the ghost and said: &ldquo;you can use blood beads and soul taking as magic weapons. The evil force invades the body deeply. In my opinion, if you don&rsquo;t have the pure and harmonious Qi of xuanhuojian to resist you, I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ll lose your mind and be fierce. What do you do if you give it to me? &quot;</p>
<p>The ghost Li body a shock, in the eye pupil slightly contracts, looks to nine tail day fox.</p>
<p>Jiuwei Tianhu smiled quietly and said, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t need to look at me like this. An old woman who has lived for thousands of years like me knows a lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost is not aware of some embarrassment, the brow is wrinkly, and finally the XuanHuo Jian is put away.</p>
<p>Nine tail Tianhu reached out and touched the small gray head in his bosom, and his eyes glanced at the ghost and said: &ldquo;at present, the evil power in your body has been eroded deeply. Although you have a deep cultivation and are suppressed by xuanhuojian, so the evil power of blood bead and soul absorption can&rsquo;t be produced frequently, but I think you must suffer from it often, and your temperament is more and more bloodthirsty, right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the moment, ghost Li is not able to look down on the eyes of the charming woman who was transformed by the Millennium fox. Although he hesitated, he nodded after a while.</p>
<p>The Nine Tailed Fox sighed and said, &ldquo;in my opinion, it&rsquo;s a strange number that you can live to this day under the blood bead and soul absorption. But if you want to continue to live safely in the future, I advise you to lose the first evil thing in the world as soon as possible. &quot;</p>
<p>The ghost face is expressionless, slowly raises the hand, the swarthy devouring spirit appears on his hand, the black stick body is mingled with the faint blood silk, lies quietly on his palm.</p>
<p>It seemed to have been a part of his body, familiar with the extreme cold feeling, swimming slowly in his body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how many lives have been saved by the first evil thing in the world you said!&rdquo; &ldquo;Ghost Li light way:&rdquo; you say I only lost it to live safely, but do not know if it is not, I simply can not live today</p>
<p>He looked up at the Nine Tailed Tianhu, his eyes cold, and said, &ldquo;besides, you have something wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nine tail day fox looked at him, smiled, said: &ldquo;what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ghost Li way:&rdquo; you say it is the first evil thing between heaven and earth, in fact it is not</p>
<p>Nine tail day fox eyebrow a wrinkly, way: &ldquo;what do you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first evil thing in the world is not it, but&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo; With his hands, he pointed to his heart and said coldly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The heart!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nine tail sky fox was stunned.</p>
<p>The man turned around in the dark, expressionless. Still with the warm night wind blowing from afar, blowing his two people&rsquo;s skirts. I don&rsquo;t know how, his figure looked, suddenly it was very bleak.</p>
<p>Jiuwei Tianhu looked at him silently. After a while, he sighed in a low voice. His voice was quiet. He said a word, but no one could hear what she said.</p>
<p>Just as she turned around and walked back, she didn&rsquo;t want to disturb GUI Li, but her voice suddenly came from behind her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Senior, you are well-informed. I have a matter of great importance. Please give me your advice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jiuwei Tianhu is slightly surprised and turns around, but sees that the ghost has been facing her, as if suddenly thinking of something. There is a trace of excitement, a trace of desire, a vision, and even a faint trace of fear on his face! &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want to ask?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A woman, ten years ago, used her whole body of blood essence to make a strong spell, then forced into her three souls and six spirits, and exerted A big mana.
