      <p>On the south side of Xiangyun mountain, the pharmacist&rsquo;s Pavilion is surrounded by green trees and a winding blue stone road, which connects with the main road of Xiangyun mountain. When there is no promotion assessment in this area, almost no one comes here. Only when there is a promotion assessment, can there be a large number of visitors.</p>
<p>In addition to the students to be assessed, most of them are friends of these people, or those who want to participate but feel uncertain. They hope to observe more times and sum up experience.</p>
<p>Looking from a distance, the pharmacist&rsquo;s pavilion looks like a man sitting on his knees. There is a huge furnace in front of him. The bottom of the stove is empty. If a big hole is dug, people can go through and walk into the square in front of the pavilion.</p>
<p>At the moment, as like as two peas in the square, the twenty are all the same. There is no difference between them. There are pockets in each side, which contain what is needed for the medicine.</p>
<p>In the early morning, Bai Xiaochun was worried about getting lost again, so he came very early. However, when he arrived here, he found that there were many people earlier than him. Dozens of people were talking in a low voice, and some of them seemed to be isolated and meditated alone.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun obviously didn&rsquo;t want to sit in meditation and wait. So he glanced and saw Xu Baocai. When he came forward, Xu Baocai noticed Bai Xiaochun. He quickly clasped his fists and talked to each other in a mixed way. All the news was about the disciples Xu Baocai knew recently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elder martial brother Bai, did you hear that when Chen Fei and Chen Fei went out half a year ago, they did not know what kind of enemy they met. They were beaten almost in no shape. Now they are still lying. However, they do not know why, and they have not told the public who beat them.&rdquo; Xu Baocai said as he looked at Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun made a ha ha, and was about to boast a few words. Suddenly, there was a lot of discussion in the crowd. He felt that he was being watched. When he looked aside, he saw a woman walking along the path.</p>
<p>The woman was dressed in a long gown of a disciple of the outside school, but she couldn&rsquo;t cover the concave and convex figure. Her waist was as thin as willow. Under the outline of those arcs, her body posture showed a wonderful beauty, especially her long thighs and tight * *. As she approached, she became more and more attractive.</p>
<p>The woman&rsquo;s face is even more beautiful and moving. Her skin is white and can be broken by blowing bullets. All over her body, she sends out bursts of fatal attraction to male students.</p>
<p>Even Bai Xiaochun heard many people around him swallowing, especially Xu Baocai. He immediately despised him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Du Lingfei, elder martial sister du I am one of the five beauties on the south bank. She is the fairy in my mind Ah, she looked at me Xu Baocai licked his lips. His eyes showed obsession. When he spoke in a low voice, he was suddenly excited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s looking at me!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun despised Tao.</p>
<p>After Du Lingfei came along, a trace of evil spirit suddenly appeared in Feng&rsquo;s eyes, and she glared at Bai Xiaochun fiercely. Although she was convinced by Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s attainments in vegetation, she was always disgusted with this man. She snorted and walked to the other side.</p>
<p>Xu Baocai looked like a lost soul, and his eyes were always on Du Lingfei. He ignored Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s disdain and became more obsessed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This Du Lingfei also came to assess&hellip;&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun looked at the twenty furnaces on the square in the distance and settled down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s OK. I&rsquo;m not comparing with her. This time it&rsquo;s a clan assessment, not the first one. Anyone who is qualified can be promoted successfully.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a while, Chen Ziang also appeared. When he arrived, he saw Bai Xiaochun, hesitated for a moment, and said hello to Bai Xiaochun with a smile. After Bai Xiaochun also clasped his fist with a smile, Chen Ziang was waiting on the side.</p>
<p>Zhao Yiduo, who met Bai Xiaochun at the mission, also came here. Gradually, more and more people came here,</p>
<p>A moment later, the door of the pharmacist&rsquo;s Pavilion creaked open, and an old man came out of it. The old man had white hair and deep eyes. At the moment of walking out, the people around him immediately became quiet.</p>
<p>He walked step by step with his hands behind his back. He stood on the square and looked at the people outside. After a long time, he nodded and spoke slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My surname is Xu. I&rsquo;m in charge of the examination of Lingtong&rsquo;s promotion to medicine apprentice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this assessment, there are two kinds of qualification for plants and medicine refining. Those who have passed the examination will pass the qualification of plants and trees.&rdquo; This Xu surname elder does not want to say more, light two words finish, close an eye, no one pays attention to.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun blinked, but there was no one on the stage. Soon, a young man came out of the crowd. The young man had a long face and a general appearance. He gave a fist to the old man named Xu. He walked out first and went straight to the door hole formed by the furnace.</p>
<p>At the moment he approached the door, a light suddenly appeared and covered him. Soon the light disappeared. The furnace was shocked and five dull sounds were heard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five tones, this represents the level of attainments of plants and plants to the fifth chapter&hellip;&rdquo; Xu Baocai deserves to be a know it all. At the moment, he whispered to Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun blinked. Before he came here, he didn&rsquo;t know it was such an assessment. He looked at the stone stove curiously and felt that there should be some connection between it and the stone tablet of Wanyao Pavilion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about this Zhou Xinqi&rsquo;s admirers are all over the mountain looking for me&hellip; &quot; Bai Xiaochun hesitated.</p>
<p>Soon, some people came out one after another, mostly five tones. But when one of them walked into the entrance cave and the voice was four tones, Xu Chang shook his sleeve and directly pushed the disciple back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elder Xu, in the past, it was not possible to take part in the assessment for four chapters of vegetation.&rdquo; The face of the expelled disciple changed and he spoke quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the rules are changed, five will be enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo; Young people stay for a while, bitter fist, dare not say anything, can only leave.</p>
<p>People all around looked at the past, and a lot of murmured. Xu Baocai was also surprised. He quickly took out a small book and recorded it. Bai Xiaochun took a look at it and found that there were many small characters written on it, which recorded the important and small events in the clan. He could not help but admire Xu Baocai&rsquo;s seriousness.</p>
<p>At this time, Zhao Yiduo stood up and walked into the entrance cave. The sound of roar reverberated. He even rang six times. Elder Xu opened his eyes and nodded slightly. After that, Zhao Yiduo stepped out of the cave with fists.</p>
<p>Chen Ziang&rsquo;s eyes flashed, and he and Zhao Yiduo were at odds. At the moment, he snorted coldly and stepped out of the cave. As he stepped on the entrance hole, he heard six roars.</p>
<p>After a tit for tat look with Zhao Yiduo, Chen Ziang sits beside a Dan stove with his knees crossed.</p>
<p>At the same time, Du Lingfei&rsquo;s eyes flashed, and she got up and approached the door. As she passed by, the six voices echoed, and all the onlookers around her expressed more admiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chen Zi&rsquo;ang, Zhao Yiduo and Du Lingfei are all the best in the outside world. They have mastered all the five chapters of plants and trees, and have mastered the first chapter of spirit and beast. In this assessment, almost 70% of them are sure that they can be promoted to medicine apprentices.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the past, most of those who had been promoted to six stone tablets were successfully promoted as long as they were not too bad at refining medicine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the four weeks of people&rsquo;s discussion, Bai Xiaochun gritted his teeth and ignored Zhou Xinqi&rsquo;s admirers. He was about to move forward. Suddenly, a figure appeared on the mountain road in the distance. The figure was a middle-aged man. His hair was scattered, but his eyes were bright. Before he arrived, his voice spread all around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After seven years of closure, Han Jianye has achieved great achievements in grass and wood. I want to be promoted not only as a medicine apprentice, but also as the first medicine apprentice in this promotion.&rdquo; With pride in his voice, his figure flashed as he echoed, and rushed to the door of the furnace.</p>
<p>Elder Xu ignored, still closed his eyes, but the people around him were surprised to hear the name of Han Jianye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Han Jianye, who has never heard of this name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Judging from his age, he should be a disciple of the outside world seven or eight years ago It&rsquo;s too difficult to be the first drug addict this time. &quot;</p>
<p>Just when the four weeks were different, Han Jianye approached the door hole with a proud look and absolute confidence. At the moment when he stepped into the door, suddenly, bursts of roar came out.</p>
<p>One, two Five, six, seven Before people react, the eighth roar reverberates directly from the furnace.</p>
<p>Elder Xu&rsquo;s eyes opened and closed in an instant. When he looked at the middle-aged man, he had a smile on his face and admiration in his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five chapters on plants and three chapters on spirits and animals, good!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Excited, Han Jianye hugged Xu Changlao and turned to look at Du Lingfei and others. The pride of his eyes was more obvious. He swung his sleeves and chose the middle stove. He sat down with confidence.</p>
<p>At this time, all the people around him took a deep breath and exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eight loud sounds, this is after the completion of the vegetation, even reached the spirit of the beast three chapters will appear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems not impossible for this man to become the first medicine apprentice this time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun in the crowd, see this scene did not feel much, but found four weeks after the people exclaimed, but feel incredible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it the three chapters of spirit and beast? How can these people make a fuss?&rdquo; He asked Xu Baocai in surprise. He remembered that there were thousands of people who had broken through the stone tablet in the third chapter of the monster beast. Even if it was the tenth stele, hundreds of people had passed it.</p>
<p>Xu Baocai rolled his eyes, and his heart was full of scorn, but in front of Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s face, he did not dare to reveal it. After coughing, he opened his mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elder martial brother Bai, you don&rsquo;t understand that. It&rsquo;s hard to get five chapters of grass and trees, but it&rsquo;s even more difficult for the chapter of spirit and beast. If you can reach six books, people will be envious, and if you can reach eight, you will be surprised. You think everyone is Zhou Xinqi, the two peerless Tianjiao of little tortoise. If you don&rsquo;t mention them, those who have passed the five chapters of grass and trees and the five chapters of spirit and animals are all over the world. If you look at the thousands of disciples of Xiangyun mountain, they are not enough Fifty</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which of the fifty is not the dragon and Phoenix among the people. You can see that there are many people in the stone tablet of Wanyao Pavilion, but it is actually a list of thousands of years ago. Many of them are now inner doors, leaving behind their positions in those years!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s more, the promotion assessment can be carried out after reaching five. It&rsquo;s obvious that this person will get 5000 contribution points by taking the first medicine apprentice, as he said Xu Baocai&rsquo;s words took some disdainful tone, but these white Xiaochun didn&rsquo;t care. He looked at Xu Baocai happily and asked a question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You just said that Zhou Xinqi and the little tortoise are peerless Tianjiao, so powerful?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, the little tortoise, in particular, is more amazing. It has created the first ten steles in a thousand years. Elder martial brother Bai, I advise you not to be ambitious.&rdquo; Xu Baocai&rsquo;s heart is even more disdainful. Just now, Bai Xiaochun laughs. The more he looks at Xu Baocai, the more pleasing he is. He pats him on the shoulder and goes out.</p>
<p>Xu Baocai was stunned. He was surprised to see Bai Xiaochun walking towards the door. After all, Bai Xiaochun was also famous for his accomplishments in vegetation. It was also a proper thing for him to take part in the examination after defeating Du Lingfei.</p>
<p>But then, Xu Baocai&rsquo;s eyes were all staring out, and Bai Xiaochun stepped into the entrance cave. After the light flashed, bursts of roar rose.</p>
<p>One, two, three Six, seven, eight!</p>
<p>All the people around him were silent, but there was no pause in the roar. The ninth sound continued until The tenth!</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>At the moment of the tenth roar, the elder Xu&rsquo;s eyes suddenly opened, and his eyes showed unprecedented essence. He looked directly at Bai Xiaochun. Even he was surprised.</p>
<p>As you know, there are not many of the thousands of disciples outside Xiangyun mountain who can reach 10 pieces of plants, trees, spirits and animals. These people have taken part in the examination for a long time and can be patient. Only after the chapters of plants, trees, spirits and animals are completed can they come to the examination. So far, he has only seen them today.</p>
<p>Even Zhou Xinqi took part in the assessment and promotion after the ninth monument.</p>
<p>Du Lingfei opened her eyes and looked blankly at Bai Xiaochun in the door. Although she knew that Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s attainments in vegetation were higher than her own, she could not imagine how she could not imagine that it was not a little bit high, but had achieved the amazing degree of great achievements in vegetation and animals.</p>
<p>Her mind was buzzing, and the whole person was in a daze. What she saw in her mind was that when she was compared with Bai Xiaochun, she demanded to be more proficient than others. When the other party asked her ranking carefully, she looked worried. At last, when Bai Xiaochun agreed, she looked worried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;White, small, pure!&rdquo; Du Lingfei gnawed her teeth fiercely. She realized at the moment that Bai Xiaochun must have been laughing in her heart at that time.</p>
<p>Chen Ziang and Zhao Yiduo both took a breath. They were shocked when they looked at Bai Xiaochun and stayed there.</p>
<p>As for Han Jianye, who has been in seclusion for many years, his body is shaking, he is staring at Bai Xiaochun, and his mind is buzzing. If there is a big wave, he has already regarded Bai Xiaochun as the enemy of his life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The key point of the promotion of medicine apprentice is refining medicine. Although he is strong, I don&rsquo;t believe that he can compare with me in refining medicine. I became the first one for this examination. I have been closed for seven years!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the same time, those outside disciples who were waiting around all took breath one by one. Only when the analogy came out, did they even have a strong cry, and many even lost their voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was Ten voices, doesn&rsquo;t it mean that his five chapters of spirit and beast have already passed through the Wanyao Pavilion, and there are less than 50 outside disciples of Xiangyun mountain who can do this! &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This guy is too tolerant. He has passed the tenth tablet of Wanyao Pavilion and has only come to participate in the promotion assessment!&rdquo;</p>
