      <p>Song Daren was a teacher at first. When he saw Zhang Xiaofan holding his cheek on his face, he was fascinated by it, and he could not help but talk about it and talk happily:</p>
<p>The process of Taiji Xuanqing Dao is easy and difficult. Most people in the first level of Yuqingjing can be cultivated in the first year, but from then on, the difficult and difficult places will show up, and the ordinary people on the second level will have to practice five. In the year, the third floor is a watershed, and those with poor qualifications will stay here for a lifetime, and it is not uncommon to have better practice for fifty or sixty years.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan gaped, Song Daren smiled slightly, and then said.</p>
<p>The main practice method of Tai Chi Xuan Qing Dao was roughly taught up to the third floor. More on that in the future, it depends on the level of qualification and self-cultivation. Teachers who practice high-level skills may give instructions on one or two. That is just a matter of personal experience, so that the disciples can take fewer detours. Of course, the so-called &ldquo;detours&rdquo; here are mostly based on centuries.</p>
<p>And those who practiced Taiji Xuanqing Dao to the fourth level of Yuqingjing have the foundation of Ten Thousand Dharma, and can start to practice other magic techniques and cultivation of their own magic at the same time. Speaking of the magic weapon, it has a long history. In myths and legends, most gods and gods have their own artifacts, which are extremely powerful. And in the world, the people who cultivated the Tao and cultivated the Tao at the beginning have great power. The small one can travel in the sky, and the big one can shake the earth and destroy the mountain.</p>
<p>The materials of the magic weapon are also varied and strange, but one thing is how the material of the magic weapon determines the power of the magic weapon after cultivation. If you use the iron to display the &ldquo;real sword magic thunder&rdquo;, and you have not waited to attack the enemy, the sword has been with the owner It became ashes.</p>
<p>As for the Qingyun Gate, because the Green Leaf Patriarch had obtained the ancient sword &ldquo;Zhu Xian&rdquo; in the &ldquo;Magical Moon Cave Mansion&rdquo; at that time, the battle was rampant in the world, and he was almost invincible. Most of the younger generation admired, most of them were practicing the fairy sword. Thousands of years later, swordsmen came out in large numbers, almost becoming the unwritten rules of Qingyunmen, and it is also necessary to change the name to Qingyunjian faction.</p>
<p>However, when it comes to this, I would like to mention that the first field of Dazhufeng is not easy. He himself repaired the sword. The body protection magic weapon &ldquo;Red Spirit&rdquo; is one of the famous swords in the Qingyun Gate, but he did not know the disciples under his seat. Why, he didn&rsquo;t mean to encourage them to practice the Immortal Sword. Not only that, but he often &ldquo;encouraged&rdquo; everyone to practice some other magic weapon. This is quite objectionable in Qingyun Gate, but once there was no such rule, it was impossible, Erlai Tian It is not easy for the disciples to have mediocre qualifications and a small number of people, so everyone can let him go.</p>
<p>Among the disciples of Dazhufeng, master brother Song Daren practiced the deepest. He has trained Taiji Xuanqing Dao to the fifth floor of Yuqingjing, followed by the eldest, He Dazhi, to the fourth floor. Although his entry time was shorter than Wu Dayi and Zheng Dali, he was the most intelligent among the disciples, so he learned first.</p>
<p>As for the second son Wu Dayi, the third son Zheng Dali, the old Wu Lv Daxin, and the old sixth Du Bishu, they all struggled on the third floor of Yuqingjing, but the younger sister Tian Ling&rsquo;er was brilliant, and his parents taught him carefully. I started to do bamboo cutting at the age of ten, but I have been practicing Tai Chi Xuan Qing Dao for many years. At a young age, I actually learned to the fourth floor of Yu Qing Jing when she was 13 years old, which can drive away magical treasures. It is one of the famous early-hui children in Qingyun Gate. It is loved and loved by parents and teachers. Su Ru also gave her the famous &ldquo;Amber Zhu Ling&rdquo; as a magic weapon for self-defense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sister Sister is so powerful!&rdquo; Zhang Xiaofan could not help sighing when he heard this.</p>
<p>Song Daren smiled and said: &ldquo;Yes, the younger sister is extremely smart, and she is more talented in the cultivation of truth. Master will tell her what she says. Upon hearing it, her qualifications are far superior to those of us. Insufficient, over time, her achievements must be limitless and far better than us. Dazhufeng&rsquo;s pulse is all on her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After all, his eyes were full of expectation, obviously he loved this charming little girl.</p>
<p>Then, Song Daren told Zhang Xiaofan some things to pay attention to during the practice, and finally said right: &ldquo;Little brother, one last thing, I must tell you: This practice is expensive, step by step, down-to-earth. , I am afraid of lack of greed, but there will be a big disaster. Success or failure, originally destiny, do not have to be forced. Such as demon alien, heresy magic, desire and dissatisfaction are all quick, and finally most of them are condemned by the heavens, pitiful and sad. You have to be careful. &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was horrified, and busy said: &ldquo;Yes, brother, I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren nodded, stood up, and said, &ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s do this first. The Taiji Cave is in Houshan. You must practice the Taiji Xuanqing Dao to three or more disciples before you can go in for cultivation. Practice in your own room. It’s very quiet here. Masters and mothers don’t usually come. You have worked hard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan stood up and said, &ldquo;Thank you, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren smiled, patted his head, and turned away.</p>
<p>※※※※※</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan sent Song Daren away, turned back to the house, closed the door, and couldn&rsquo;t tell the excitement under his heart. Even the fatigue of cutting bamboo in the morning, he didn&rsquo;t know where he was thrown.</p>
<p>He took a deep breath, calmed down, slowly walked to the bed, meditated in the posture taught by Song Daren, closed his eyes, and thought about the first-level method of Taiji Xuanqing Dao Yuqingjing taught by Song Daren in his heart, I was about to follow the practice, and suddenly my heart moved, suddenly opened my eyes and lost his voice: &ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first layer of Yu Qingjing taught to him by Song Daren was originally the most superficial and basic practice method in Taiji Xuanqing Dao, and its function is only in two words: practicing Qi. The cultivator sits quietly, relaxes all thoughts and prohibits all kinds of worries, and leads the heaven and earth aura into the body to practice the big week, so as to breathe with heaven and earth, and then realize the creation of heaven and earth. If you can introduce Reiki to practice the 36th Zhoutian in your body, your meridians are already stable and you can practice a higher level.</p>
<p>This practice method was originally a Taoist practice for thousands of years, and there is no doubt about mistakes, but Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s heart at the moment is like a storm and a sway. All this is because what he heard today is contrary to the set of formulas passed to him by the Buddhist monk that day.</p>
<p>The night before Cao Miao Village’s massacre, Pu Zhi told him plainly that when he cultivated Qi, he must cut off all his connections with the outside world and realize his own nature. Not born, not destroyed, not dirty, not increasing, not decreasing, it is colorless in the air, without thinking, without eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, colorless, sound, fragrance, taste, touch, There is no vision, no consciousness, no ignorance, no ignorance, no old death, no old death, no suffering, no wisdom and no wisdom. (Note: &ldquo;Pan Ruo Xin Jing&rdquo; is spoken)</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan couldn&rsquo;t understand this kind of truth at this time, but the two methods of practice were fundamentally different, but he was able to distinguish it. He was so confused at the moment that he didn&rsquo;t know what to do.</p>
<p>In fact, Zhang Xiaofan didn&rsquo;t know that Tai Chi Xuanqing Dao is of course the supreme magic of Taoism, but Pu Zhi made great ambitions on him and placed his life expectation. The formula he passed was also the supreme method of Buddhism-the Great Brahma Prajna.</p>
<p>Two kinds of Dafa and two completely different ways of practice have to start from the root.</p>
<p>Buddhism and Taoism have a long history and do not communicate with each other, and the techniques of self-cultivation also originate from their schools of thought. Take Taoism as an example. Its main purpose is to use the word &ldquo;Tao&rdquo;. The so-called: Tao produces one, two produces one, two produces three, and three produces everything. All things bear the yin and hold the yang, and the qi feels peace. (Note: the fifth chapter of the moral scriptures of the Daodejing). Taoism originated from Taoist thought, and even the triple realm of Taiji Xuanqing Taoism was also based on the Yuqing, Shangqing, and Taiqing of Taoist mythology of Yuanshi Tianzun, Lingbao Tianzun and moral Tianzun, also known as the &ldquo;Sanqing&rdquo;. name. Taoism comprehension, pay attention to the rest of the world, to be with nature, to defend the nature with the body, and turn it into great power.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the theme of Buddhism is &ldquo;Things should be born without a place to live, and everything should be inseparable from nature.&rdquo; Youyun: What period of self-sufficiency is pure; what period of self-sufficiency has no birth and death; what period of self-sufficiency is originally self-sufficient; (Note: The language of &ldquo;Altar Sutra: Xing You Ping First&rdquo; is spoken) The Buddha&rsquo;s self-cultivation, emphasizing self-understanding, and seeing the five aggregates, &ldquo;can generate 84,000 wisdoms in general&rdquo; is the reason.</p>
<p>Buddhism and Taoism are very different. Naturally, the practice of teaching also runs counter to each other. It&rsquo;s just that they have kept secrets for thousands of years and are unknown. At the moment, Zhang Xiaofan, a small disciple on the Dazhu Peak of Qingyunmen, was so overwhelmed by this matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which one is right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan jumped out of bed and walked back and forth in the room, only to feel a confusion in his mind, and he did not dare to ask people. Finally he had to sit by the bed and sighed for a long time.</p>
<p>He was not a wise man, he was born in a farm, he was young, and he had no knowledge of judgment. He thought about these major events in vain for a long time, but he still couldn&rsquo;t think of one. At the end, Zhang Xiaofan said to himself in his heart: &ldquo;Forget it, anyway Master Master Zhizhi didn&rsquo;t talk about this kind of situation, I practiced together, that&rsquo;s it.&rdquo; No more thinking at the moment, but my heart was relaxed for a while. . Bed, meditate and meditate, go to practice Tai Chi Xuan Qing Dao first.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that he thinks it&rsquo;s easy, but it&rsquo;s completely different. Tai Chi Xuan Qing Dao refining Qi, opening seven pores of the whole body, leading the heaven and earth Aura into the body to run along the meridians, in order to exercise and stabilize the body vitality and inner meridian meridians; the big Brahma Prajna asked to enter the realm of silence and obliterate the whole body, intending to know and practice As a world, seeing one&rsquo;s own nature, with a deep heart and solid foundation.</p>
<p>The two sets of methods were diametrically opposed, but Zhang Xiaofan was miserable. In the next three months, in addition to the daily wind and rain, he went up the mountain and cut bamboo, and he practiced these two methods. It was just that when he practiced Tai Chi Xuan Qing Dao, he just had a small success, the whole body was opened, and the aura entered the body. The next big Brahma had to close all the holes and enter the state of silence. He could not help but work hard and almost paid the water.</p>
<p>After March, Tian was not interested in coming all day. He came to investigate the situation of Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s monastery. Unexpectedly, he asked him to give it a try. According to common sense, ordinary people practice Tai Chi Xuan Qing Dao, with the first layer of superficiality, and three months later, they should have small achievements, and they can initially lead the world&rsquo;s aura into the body and run for three to five weeks. Unexpectedly, the difference between Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s qualifications is really rare. After three months of practice, I couldn&rsquo;t even control the whole body&rsquo;s orifices. As for the introduction of aura into the body, it was reluctant, let alone running for a few weeks.</p>
<p>Tian is not easy to widen his eyes and stares at Zhang Xiaofan with a face full of anger. All the disciples beside him have sympathy, but they dare not speak out. Song Daren originally wanted to say a few words for Zhang Xiaofan, but the teachers and disciples he taught actually learned At this point, his face was dull and he dared not speak. As for Tian Ling&rsquo;er, he looked at the joke with a smile.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was embarrassed and knelt in front of Tian Nan. He felt compelled to have no place. He thought that no matter how the master scolded, it should be. Unexpectedly, after waiting for a long time, the brothers around said nothing, and even Tian was not easy to say a word. He was strange in his heart and secretly raised his eyes to see, but Tian was not easy to be angry, and I didn’t know when to turn into a disappointment, I really should. In a word: Sorrow is more than death!</p>
<p>I saw that Tian was not easy to get up, shook his head, moved his chunky body, and said nothing, and walked towards the back hall. The disciples looked at each other for unknown reasons.</p>
<p>Song Daren was not easy to follow Tian for the longest time, vaguely knowing what Tian Tian was not thinking about, guessing that Master was afraid to give up this little brother. In the past three months, apart from practising his homework, Zhang Xiaofan is always busy and helpful in his free time. He is also honest, and everyone likes him very much. The lonely mountain is Tian Ling&rsquo;er who has always been arrogant. Suddenly there is a playmate close to his age. Even though he often scolds on the surface, he is a little happy in his heart.</p>
<p>Song Daren frowned tightly and stepped up to support Zhang Xiaofan, saying: &ldquo;Young Master, Master is just annoyed for a moment, don&rsquo;t worry. As long as you study hard, you will get his old man&rsquo;s approval sooner or later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was ashamed and nodded again and again, working harder ever since.</p>
<p>He and Tian Ling&rsquo;er cut bamboo uphill in the morning every morning. The ordinary disciples could cut the black knot bamboo in March after practicing Taiji Xuan Qing Dao. Zhang Xiaofan actually cut the first black knot bamboo only half a year later. But the weather is unstoppable every day, and his body is quite strong, and at least he will not be panting again.</p>
<p>From that time on, Tian Nanjian didn’t even care about Zhang Xiaofan. Song Daren also asked him several times about his training, but the longer the time, Zhang Xiaofan’s entry was slow, and in the end, even Song Daren Also discouraged, no longer asked him.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan didn&rsquo;t care about himself. He knew that his qualifications were not good. Although he sometimes wondered whether it was due to the cultivation of the two methods, but every time he thought about this, he would remember the tone of the monk Pu Zhi. Persevere. Although it was extremely difficult to practice along the way, he was persistent and stubborn, but he still supported it.</p>
<p>He lived in a secluded place, practiced Tai Chi Xuan Qing Dao during the day, and practiced Brahma Prajna again at night. After such a long time, he passed by suddenly, not knowing that three years had passed.</p>
<p>During this period, Zhang Xiaofan also set the worst record since the establishment of Qingyunmen: He spent three years in full, which means that he spent three times as much time as the ordinary people, and finally Tai Chi Xuan Qing Dao Yu Qing Jing After the first level of cultivation is completed, you can control the whole body orifice freely, and lead the aura of the world into the body for 36 weeks. But what everyone did not know is that he also practiced the Great Brahma Prajna at the same time, and he also peeped out in the control of internal air, laying a solid foundation.</p>
<p>When Zhang Xiaofan timidly announced to everyone at the dinner of the day, all the disciples in Dayun Peak of Qingyun Gate were stunned. If they saw the thousand-year-old iron tree blooming, everyone laughed loudly. Song Daren even hugged Zhang Xiaofan, who had grown up a lot. In the air, a few times in a row, rejoicing.</p>
<p>And Tian, ​​who was sitting in front of him, didn&rsquo;t look at him coldly, snorted, and whispered: &ldquo;Great idiot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the past three years, Zhang Xiaofan has grown to be 14 years old. Because he cut bamboo every day, his body is also strong. Although he is two years younger than his sister Tian Ling&rsquo;er, he is generally tall. Tian Ling&rsquo;er grew from a 13-year-old girl to a 16-year-old daughter&rsquo;s house, and her appearance was even more beautiful.</p>
<p>Tian Ling&rsquo;er always felt that the other six brothers were too big and old-fashioned, so they always liked to stay with this stupid brother. After three years, they were intimate. However, Tian Ling&rsquo;er has always prevailed. Zhang Xiaofan feels that Sister Zhang is much better than herself. Although she was instructed to drink on weekdays, she was occasionally teased by her brother, but she was the first to stand up and grumble. Support yourself.</p>
<p>The mountain home is lonely, but it is also quiet. In the meantime, Zhang Xiaofan has also asked Tian Yi and Song Daren about the massacre in Cao Miao Village, but the matter has been clueless. For a long time, Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s heart finally faded.</p>
<p>※※※※※</p>
<p>Early this morning, Zhang Xiaofan took his hatchet as usual and walked out of the house alone, toward the back mountain. Tian Ling&rsquo;er had finished the bamboo cutting homework two years ago, and he didn&rsquo;t go anymore. So in the past two years, Zhang Xiaofan mostly went up the mountain alone. However, Tian Ling&rsquo;er sometimes had nothing to do, and also ran up the mountain to have fun with him.</p>
<p>Today, Zhang Xiaofan didn&rsquo;t see Tian Linger&rsquo;s figure, and didn&rsquo;t care. He went up the mountain road alone, and after more than a month, he would end his bamboo cutting work. He can now cut two black knot bamboos every day, but he is still far inferior to Tian Linger. When Tian Linger was about to end, he could cut more than ten black knot bamboos a day.</p>
<p>A month ago, he finally became the first layer of Taiji Xuanqing Dao Yuqingjing, and Song Daren passed on his second layer of know-how. He practiced for a month, although it was much more esoteric than the first floor, but somehow, he vaguely felt that it was easier than the first floor. For example, the first layer needs to control the whole body orifice, and he only spent three years to achieve success, while the second layer requires &ldquo;turning qi into essence&rdquo;, so that the heaven and earth spirits introduced into the body can be transformed into essence in the meridians. According to the elder brother, this is more than ten times harder than the first layer, but Zhang Xiaofan consciously was unexpectedly relaxed. Investigating its roots, it seems to have something to do with the set of &ldquo;Great Brahma Prajna&rdquo;. In the past three years, he has practiced the Great Brahma Prajna daily. He has never stopped. The internal Qi movement is already quite hot, and the essence of Qi is the internal Qi. On the basis of the year, Zhang Xiaofan entered the country extremely fast.</p>
<p>But he didn&rsquo;t believe in himself. When someone practiced for a year, he had to practice for three years. This time it was probably an illusion. So he didn&rsquo;t care, anyway, he practiced on time every day, and no one came to disturb.</p>
