      <p>Nan&rsquo;an is shocked. All the disciples who know Bai Xiaochun seem to have never known him at this moment. At this moment, Bai Xiaochun gives them a very strange feeling, which is totally different from the figure in memory who likes to call him uncle Bai, cheap and always makes people want to beat him up.</p>
<p>There are countless inspirations coming from the north bank. All of them are staring at Bai Xiaochun at this moment. Everyone&rsquo;s mind is booming. They didn&rsquo;t know Bai Xiaochun before, and their impression of him remained shameless in the previous few scenes. But now this scene makes all of them take a breath.</p>
<p>On the terrace, Zheng Yuandong looks at luqimang and the other peaks around him. Everyone is dignified. Li Qinghou has a smile in his eyes. His heart is warm. When he looks at Bai Xiaochun, he is proud.</p>
<p>All the elders took a deep breath and looked dignified.</p>
<p>In the middle of the air, the officer was blessed with blood, and his eyes were dazed. He didn&rsquo;t believe that he had lost, and that he had lost to Bai Xiaochun, whom he despised. For him, the humiliation in his heart was greater than that of his body. He was not reconciled. Seeing that he was about to fall out of the battle platform, he let out a shrill roar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bai Xiaochun, our war is not over yet.&rdquo; When his words came out, he bit the tip of his tongue and spewed out blood. His hair withered with naked eyes. His hands quickly pinched, and his whole body trembled. From his heavenly position, a bloody light burst out!</p>
<p>The blood light was so overwhelming that it turned into a bloody sword!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten secret methods, this life sword!&rdquo; Many people recognized it immediately and exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Disha array!&rdquo; Shangguan Tianyou pinches the formula with both hands recklessly, and points to Bai Xiaochun. At once, his blood sword blows and turns into countless blood threads. It turns into a sword net and runs straight to Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>There was a stronger and sharper sound of breaking the air.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun raised his head, his right hand raised, still a finger.</p>
<p>This finger, immediately in front of him, seemed to be distorted in the moment. A huge purple tripod suddenly appeared. The tripod was extremely solid, and even the patterns on it were clearly visible, just like the real tripod, without any illusions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Purple gas into tripod, my God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too real. This is not an ordinary purple gas melting tripod. This is the second stage.&rdquo; The south bank suddenly exclaimed, especially the purple tripod peak, who were more startled.</p>
<p>In the eyes of all the people, the purple tripod and the bloody sword array all of a sudden ran into each other and broke out into a deafening noise. Shangguan Tianyou spurted blood and laughed bitterly, and was directly swept out.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun looks as usual. Standing on the battle platform, he looks at the big tripod scattered in the sky. All of a sudden, the ghost teeth in front of the crowd on the north bank burst out a strange light in his eyes. His body flies out in an instant and stands directly on the battle platform.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shangguan Tianyou is no longer able to fight any more, so it will save the tedious work. Come with me First World War As soon as the ghost tooth uttered his words, black fog suddenly rose all over his body. Around him, the black fog turned into a series of fierce ghosts and roared soundlessly towards Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>Those fierce ghosts looked ferocious. Some were dishevelled, some were covered with green skin, and some were like decayed corpses for many years. They carried their own heads, which was extremely terrible.</p>
<p>The whole battle platform was filled with a sense of stillness, which made the disciples on both sides of the Strait feel cold.</p>
<p>At the same time, figures flew out from the crowd on both sides of the Strait. Those people looked dignified one by one. They were not the outer disciples, but the inner disciples of both sides. All of them appeared at the moment, focusing on the last battle of Tianjiao battle!</p>
<p>Even the divine consciousness of the four Supreme elders on the top of the planting road was swept and condensed in the battle platform.</p>
<p>At this moment, the attention of all!</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun turns around and looks at GUI ya. His face is dignified. In this day&rsquo;s arrogant battle, GUI Ya&rsquo;s several moves are really amazing. One finger almost kills LV Tianlei, and that&rsquo;s only 70% of his strength.</p>
<p>It would be unimaginable if all the fighting power broke out.</p>
<p>At the moment when Bai Xiaochun looked at the ghost tooth, his eyes flashed, and his right hand pointed to Bai Xiaochun. At the same time, the sky and the earth roared. Beside the ghost tooth, a huge ghost claw suddenly appeared, occupying half of the battle platform. The sound of breaking through the air was raised, which drove Bai Xiaochun straight to Bai Xiaochun and exploded in an instant.</p>
<p>The speed was so fast that in the blink of an eye, Bai Xiaochun raised his right hand and clenched his fist. His whole body was shining with silver light, as if he had become a silver man. He punched away at the huge ghost claw.</p>
<p>Looking from a distance, the thin white Xiaochun is insignificant compared with the amazing ghost claw, but his fist, at this moment, and the moment of touching with the ghost claw, burst out the earth shaking and deafening noise.</p>
<p>Boom! Boom!</p>
<p>The voice rolled like thunder and spread all around, making all the disciples on both sides of the battle platform step back and look startled. Many people were even dazzled by the shock.</p>
<p>A strong force burst out between Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s fist and the ghost claw. The ghost claw trembled and cracked under the sound of click. The fragmentation instantly diffused and diffused the whole ghost claw, that is, a breathing time. With a bang, the huge ghost claw actually broke into pieces.</p>
<p>Countless black fog rolled toward all directions, and the whole battle platform seemed to vibrate. In the eyes of the ghost teeth, he burst out a fine light. His body stepped back and stepped on it fiercely.</p>
<p>At the foot of the ground, there is a circle of fragmentation, he is opposite Bai Xiaochun, at the moment, the face is ruddy, the body is like a step back, the right hand silver light is shining, can look carefully, also in slightly shaking.</p>
<p>At the moment, all the students on the lookout took a breath. Both the north bank and the south bank all burst out with exclamations and exclamations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This Bai Xiaochun So strong</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is even with brother guiya! I remember that when the Luochen family rebelled, he killed the enemy by leaps and bounds. I thought it was exaggeration, but now&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the first time I&rsquo;ve seen a ghost claw with a disciple who can smash ghost teeth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Those inner disciples were equally frightened. They looked at Bai Xiaochun and GUI ya, and everyone felt more bitter and bitter. This kind of outer disciples shocked them. In their eyes, this was not the outer gate. It was a monster. It might not have been a demon for many years. Now There were two.</p>
<p>On the terrace, the leader&rsquo;s eyes showed surprise, and the elders of Lingxi clan all looked sideways.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun frowned, his right hand just appeared acid hemp, although soon recovered, but in front of this ghost tooth, to him, is a strong enemy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are much better than others in breaking my first finger, which is 50% of my strength. So I can safely expand 80% force. &quot; Ghost teeth looked at Bai Xiaochun, but his eyes showed a strong interest, as if very happy, right hand pinch Jue, pointing to Bai Xiaochun again.</p>
<p>As soon as the words came out, the sky above Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s head suddenly shrouded in clouds and black gas condensed. In a flash, it was like a crack torn by an invisible big hand, and an incredibly ghost claw appeared again.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s even bigger and more amazing than the ghost claw that nearly killed LV Tianlei before. With a bang, he goes straight to Bai Xiaochun, which is like a mountain on the top of the mountain.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun suddenly raised his head and clenched his fist with his right hand. At the moment when the ghost claw came, his body rose from the ground and turned into a rainbow. He took the initiative to attack, close to the ghost claw, and punched out.</p>
<p>The fist had a certain potential. His whole body was filled with silver light, shaking the sky, and his body was not dead. At this moment, it broke out strongly, making the fist fall, and the ghost claw trembled, and there was a crack!</p>
<p>As soon as the ghost tooth&rsquo;s face changed, the third, fourth, and fifth fingers of the formula were all unfolded at the same time.</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, in the vicinity of Bai Xiaochun, three majestic ghost claws appeared at the same time, pounding hard at him here.</p>
<p>All this is slow to say, but in fact it only happened in a flash. Seeing that four ghost claws were rushing towards Bai Xiaochun, all the outer disciples around him exclaimed one by one, and those inner disciples were also shocked.</p>
<p>On the terrace, the leader and others got up one after another. Li Qing&rsquo;s eyes flashed with the essence, but soon he stopped thinking of saving people.</p>
<p>In the room of electric light and flint, the four ghost claws hit Bai Xiaochun at the same time. When the impact spread to the four directions, the battle platform was even more fragmented, countless stones were lifted, and dust and fog filled the place where Bai Xiaochun was located.</p>
<p>But in this fuzzy moment, a figure as fast as lightning, directly from the fuzzy inside a rush out, the speed, instant near the ghost teeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Broken waiting lock!&rdquo; A low voice suddenly broke out, and the silver light became everything in everyone&rsquo;s eyes. It seemed that the two fingers of the whole body&rsquo;s silver light appeared directly in front of the ghost tooth. A strong life and death crisis that he felt for the first time made the ghost tooth roar here. The whole body fog broke out instantly, and a lot of protection light appeared, and the body quickly retreated.</p>
<p>But at the same time when he retreated, a suction came from Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s two fingers, which made the ghost tooth&rsquo;s body not only unable to retreat, but was sucked closer.</p>
<p>When he touched Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s two fingers, his protective light seemed fragile and broke down. No matter how he resisted, he even unfolded three small shields, which did not help. When he touched Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s two fingers, the first shield broke into pieces, and the second broke into two, Although the third side was still intact, it was strongly impacted and flew to one side.</p>
<p>It is still unstoppable!</p>
<p>Seeing that Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s two fingers shuttled through everything, they appeared in front of the ghost tooth. At this time, the ghost tooth made a shrill sound, and his hair suddenly turned white. At this cost, his body suddenly blurred and was directly penetrated by Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s two fingers, but he grasped the air.</p>
<p>There was a bang, and there were bursts of crackling sound from the empty place, as if the air had been crushed. In the distance of Bai Xiaochun, the ghost tooth appeared again, a mouthful of blood gushed out, and even some wrinkles appeared on his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me use the method of protecting my life once, Bai Xiaochun I despise you The ghost tooth was panting and looked up at Bai Xiaochun. Instead of flinching back, he showed a strong sense of war. However, he was already shocked. He did not know what kind of magic power was used by the other side, so he broke out the fighting power beyond the condensation of Qi.</p>
<p>White small pure mouth overflow blood, he stood there, at the moment the figure appeared, behind the cauldron broken, a lot of his leather clothes collapsed, the whole body seems to be as usual, but his breath is also a little disordered.</p>
<p>Before the other party&rsquo;s five finger ghost claw, although Bai Xiaochun bear down, can be as difficult, if not for the undead skin to the silver, he had been defeated before.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the potential in the must get a blow, but the other side to avoid.</p>
