      <p>Apart from the ancient forbidden area, there is no other noise except the sound of fighting and roaring from the distant mountains. There is a gentle mountain breeze, gently blowing from the distance, the green mountains shaking together, as if it is not the scenery of the world.</p>
<p>Under the four strong characters of the magic moon cave, the simple stone wall outside the cave has peeled off a lot, as if recording endless years flowing here quietly. At the moment, the mountain seems to be silent, watching the two men silent confrontation.</p>
<p>How many years of time, like this quietly passed, when looking back, the old friends, and how many left?</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu has been silent, but the expression on his face is constantly changing violently. Only his eyes have never left the ghostly figure. The man standing in front of him in silence! Is it really the original Zhang Xiaofan?</p>
<p>Finally, he spoke, in a low voice and a little hoarse, and said, &ldquo;why did you kill him? He&rsquo;s just an old man in his old age. &quot;</p>
<p>The muscles on his face seemed to twitch. He raised his eyes and looked at Lin Jingyu. The childhood playmate had blue veins on his face. You can see that he was trying to control his emotions, but his strong expression seemed to be his inborn appearance!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, when he was a kid, he was already familiar with it. Now, he stands there, standing in the sun, questioning himself</p>
<p>Deep in the forest, as if there are a pair of dark eyes, coldly staring at the two men&rsquo;s figure.</p>
<p>After staring at him for a long time, he said slowly, &ldquo;he is in my way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu snorted. Then, he looked up at the sky and took a deep breath, as if he were telling something to himself. A moment later, when he turned back, he was already a cold expression.</p>
<p>He looked at the ghost, looking at this once very familiar but now so strange face. &ldquo;Since the disaster in Caomiao village, only the two of us survived, I always thought you were my brother, do you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The corner of his mouth twitched. Slowly nodded.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu stares at him and says, &ldquo;in my heart, I always thought that we were the closest people, so even ten years ago, you betrayed Qingyun. I have always been hopeful that one day you will find yourself lost and return to the right path.</p>
<p>â€™For the first time, there was a bleak expression on his face, but there was still a hint of hatred in his disappointment. He sneered: &ldquo;however, I am still wrong after all. I should have understood that you are not my best brother Zhang Xiaofan at that time. You are a villain of the demon sect now, and you are cruel and cruel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed in dismay. His face was more resolute. Hearing only the sound of the dragon&rsquo;s chant, the blue light was full of vigor. The sword was like a dragon, surging and ready to choose a man to eat. Lin Jingyu&rsquo;s young but angry face seemed ferocious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You and I used to love each other, but today we&rsquo;re all broken!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sonorous words. It&rsquo;s like being absolutely certain. Then a green light sword rose, tearing the silence, flying in the sky on the hard ground stones sweeping across, roaring. After a long time. After the hustle and bustle, what is left is a deep sword mark on the stone slab, which is separated between two people.</p>
<p>His face suddenly changed, and even his body trembled slightly for some reason. He was staring at the deep mark on the ground. For the first time, there was a trace of pain that was hard to hide.</p>
<p>The mark of the sword was so deep that it was embedded in the hard stone and could no longer be erased. He looked at the trace so much that he even neglected what Lin Jingyu said.</p>
<p>The deep sword mark, once upon a time, it was even like a familiar?</p>
<p>It seems that at any time, there is a person who is cherished in his heart. He seems to have broken his feelings and made up his mind!</p>
<p>Deep mark, deep mark, cut the stone under the foot, cut off the world love, hurt, but whose heart?</p>
<p>Like unable to breathe, he gasped for breath, and even his body began to tremble uncontrollably. But the next moment, he controlled himself again. The excited expression flashed on his face and never appeared again. He slowly lowered his head, unknown, and quietly clenched his teeth.</p>
<p>Then, he looked up and looked at Lin Jingyu for a long time. He clenched his hands into fists, and even his fingernails were deeply embedded in the flesh.</p>
<p>But on his face, he smiles.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu became more and more angry and said, &ldquo;what are you laughing at?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at him for a long time and said in a low voice, &ldquo;do you know where you&rsquo;re going?&rdquo; He suddenly burst into a loud laugh, with a shrill laugh. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lost my way. I can&rsquo;t find my way. But what&rsquo;s the right way? Is your way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu said in a sharp voice: &ldquo;yes, the right way is the right way. If you abandon the right way, you will fall into a wrong way.</p>
<p>&quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu&rsquo;s body was shocked, but he was stunned.</p>
<p>He looked up at the sky and spurned angrily: &ldquo;who said that the right way is the right way? Did you say that? Then the right way you said is the right way, and how can you be regarded as the right way? &quot;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu&rsquo;s eyebrows wrinkled tightly and his face showed his murderous intention. He said coldly, &ldquo;since you and I have been cut off from each other, there is no need to say more!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going to kill me?&rdquo; he said</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu said with awe: &ldquo;the old man who died under your command has taught me attentively over the past ten years. He has treated me like a son and a mountain of kindness, just like my father. If he died at your hands, and you are unrepentant, I will remove the evil for the people and avenge his old man. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are so many jackals and wolves in this world. It&rsquo;s just that I can&rsquo;t die because my wish has not been fulfilled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu gave a long smile, which was full of scorn. He cut the dragon sword and lit up his sword. He said coldly, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t talk nonsense. I&rsquo;ll settle the friendship between you and me for more than ten years now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ghost Li hum a, the right side of the faint green light, that year&rsquo;s firestick flicker dark light, quietly fly up.</p>
<p>The birds sing softly, the mountain is more secluded, the mountain is green, the breeze is gentle, under the boundless blue sky, before the Millennium ancient cave, two childhood friends, coldly opposite, will do life and death struggle.</p>
<p>It was at this time that suddenly, from the place behind them, from the &ldquo;magic moon cave&rdquo;, a low roar was heard, and the surrounding land boundary began to tremble slightly, and their looks changed.</p>
<p>At a time when they haven&rsquo;t responded. In that thousand year old cave, a purple gas flashed through, and in a twinkling of an eye, the purple air rose and covered the cave. Clouds surging, during which a thunder like sound, purple gas such as columns, momentum, straight to the clouds and go.</p>
<p>There are only two left in front of the wonders of heaven and earth. At the moment, a very small man, his lapels flying, once again indifferent to each other.</p>
<p>The wind is blowing.</p>
<p>The peak of Tongtian peak is solemn and solemn. It&rsquo;s not only the right way, but also the dark animal spirits in front of us. They seem to feel something. They all calm down, raise their heads in silence and look up to the sky.</p>
<p>Standing on the huge head of the white bone monster. The bright silk clothes of the God of beasts fluttered gently in the wind. He looked like a young face, but in his eyes, he did not know how much wind and frost he had experienced, and he also looked at the huge sword array gradually appearing in the sky.</p>
<p>The majestic purple Qi rises from Qingyun Mountain at the back of Tongtian peak. Its speed is as fast as electricity, and its potential is incomparable. It rises like a huge purple column standing in the sky. It suddenly appears in the boundless world. I saw purple vapor. Turbulent flow, breaking through the sky, and finally fell on the ancient sword of killing immortals, which is like stone and non stone.</p>
<p>The next moment, the ancient sword of Zhuxian was lit up. Even after a long distance, countless human beings can still feel that there is something in the ancient sword, which is touched by it. Wake up from a long sleep.</p>
<p>On the ancient sword of Zhuxian, there is no light blooming, reflecting the face of Taoist immortal.</p>
<p>He was dressed in a dark green Taoist robe. He was windless and hunting. He held the sword in his right hand and held the sword formula in his left hand. His voice was low from heaven and earth, like a Buddhist Chant or a different mantra. It reverberated far away. All of a sudden, he waved the sword formula with his left hand and stabbed the sky. Almost at the same time, at the other six towering peaks of Qingyun Mountain, the six colors of light rose at the same time, like a rainbow running through the sky, breaking through the sky, crossing a long track on the sky, and finally falling on the ancient sword of killing immortals.</p>
<p>In an instant, the ancient sword of Zhuxian was engulfed by the dazzling brilliance. If the sun fell into the human world, it could not be seen. The brilliant light burst out from the ancient sword, and immediately dissipated the black air that originally circled in the sky.</p>
<p>In the strong light, the seven colors of light merge into one and rise in the dazzling white light. In the sky, it turns into a huge seven color sword with brilliant streamer and rainbow light. After that, the huge color main sword began to grow larger and larger under the continuous infusion of Qi Mai mountain spirit. In the process of growing, small monochromatic Qi swords of various colors were separated, and more and more of them began to distribute in the sky.</p>
<p>On the ground, a burst of cheers broke out among the crowd of watchers. Countless young disciples, whether under the Qingyun gate or not, looked up at the mythical majestic sword array in the sky. And many people who have experienced the blue cloud turmoil ten years ago seem to have a complex mood at the moment. Some are happy, others are silent.</p>
<p>Among the crowd, among the crowd of young disciples around, Lu Xueqi looked up silently at the brilliant and powerful sword array of killing immortals, and even reflected down from the sky, covering all the people including her and brightening her cheek.</p>
<p>However, her cold and beautiful face, there is no expression, only a pair of bright eyes, reflecting the seven color light, quiet, flashing with strange feelings, but after all, no one can see her deep heart.</p>
<p>Ten years of time, the original in inadvertently, so quietly passed, who can remember that year in the Qingyun Mountain tearing heart and lung roar? Who can remember the young man in despair?</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s body trembled slightly, as if suddenly thought of something unbearable and moving, even the expression on her face was gloomy, only subconsciously, she held the Tianya sword in her hand more tightly.</p>
<p>The shadow of the sword is more and more dense. It covers the whole sky.</p>
<p>In the eyes of the beast God, the infinite shadow of the sword was reflected in the sky. After watching for a long time, he nodded his head. His face was solemn, and he sighed: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s really amazing. I can&rsquo;t imagine that there are such rare people in the Middle Earth who can gather the spirit of the mountain to create such a unique sword array. It&rsquo;s amazing! &quot;</p>
<p>He clapped his hands in praise and said three times: &ldquo;great!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amazing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amazing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He praised him so much, but there was not a trace of fear and fear on his face. In other words, no one knew that there was fear and fear in such things as he was like human beings, ghosts and demons?</p>
<p>In the wind and cloud, the huge white bone monster makes a low growl sound, rises slowly and stands in the air, facing the water Qilin in in front. There is also a Taoist immortal standing on the back of shuiqilin.</p>
<p>The wind blows, the sky is silent!</p>
<p>At the foot of those people, the noise of the beast demon, as if suddenly become far away, only two people so face to face confrontation. The world is open, but it seems narrow and can&rsquo;t hold two people.</p>
<p>They looked at it.</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan said coldly: &ldquo;under the sword of killing immortals, demons and spirits have never escaped alive. If you are smart. I&rsquo;ll give you a life in Qingyun Mountain. &quot;</p>
<p>The beast God was stunned, and then he laughed. He ignored him, but shook his head slightly, and his face seemed to have some sarcasm. Seeing this, immortal daoxuan stopped talking. He breathed deeply and held the ancient sword of Zhuxian tightly in his right hand. With a sudden move of the left hand, an orange air sword suddenly emerges from the Zhuxian sword array, and shoots at the beast God.</p>
<p>The beast God&rsquo;s face was indifferent, but his eyes were fixed on the flying Qi sword. Seeing that the orange sword was like an electric light, it flew less than a foot in front of him. The beast god suddenly raised his left hand, and his five fingers spread out in the direction of the air sword.</p>
<p>In the middle of the sky, black gas is born out of nothing. In front of the animal God body, the boundary immediately condensed into a black shield wall, the top and bottom pointed, hard to block in front of the orange sword.</p>
<p>A moment later. Orange air sword hit the black shield!</p>
<p>Heaven and earth, in such a moment, is still silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boom!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, as the rising sun leaped out of the water, the sky and earth began to roar, and the huge roar burst out in an instant. And in the black gas orange light, there are a few flashes of light, just slowly fade down.</p>
<p>These two things, which were originally invisible, were like the hardest treasures in the world shaking each other. The whole sky and the earth were shrouded in a huge roar.</p>
<p>Invisible sound wave, with the strong wind passing by, Qingyun Mountain, everyone is in the ear of the buzzing strange sound, face pale. Although it has been known that these two men are both extremely high-level figures in Taoism, just after the fight, it seems that the ordinary one is trying to explore each other. It is unexpected that such a powerful one is actually. At the same time, the final outcome of this fight is even more elusive.</p>
<p>Some people even think that after this catastrophe, under such fierce fighting methods, they don&rsquo;t know what will become of Qingyun Mountain.</p>
<p>In the middle of the sky, daoxuan real man and the beast God looked at each other. They were all expressionless, and they could not see any feeling of surprise. Under the brilliant colorful air sword, the black air surrounding the beast God is particularly dazzling.</p>
<p>For a long time, immortal daoxuan snorted coldly. The sword rhyme of his left hand was cited. The flying place of his Taoist robe reflected the shining ancient sword killing the immortal. However, it could be seen that in the sky, there was a sudden gust of wind all over the sky, and half of the sky was shaking in an instant. For a time, the sky streamed brilliantly, dazzling already extremely, can hardly be seen.</p>
<p>The face of the beast God changed, and he concentrated on each other. Sure enough, it took only a moment. Starting from behind the real man daoxuan, dozens of colorful air swords had already turned their heads and fluttered in the air, aiming at the beast God. The icy air was surging in a twinkling of an eye. Before long, half of the Qi swords in the air seemed to be manipulated by invisible forces and turned around slowly.</p>
<p>Between heaven and earth, a sense of killing. However, no one else was surprised. The ancient sword Zhuxian in daoxuan&rsquo;s hand had been surging. At the same time, as a raging tide burst out and the waves were pounding on the bank, more than 100 monochromatic Qi swords in the Zhuxian sword array formed a huge sword rain of seven Zhang in length and width.</p>
<p>All over the sky is the sound of breaking through the sky, and the sound of &ldquo;whoosh&rdquo; penetrates the world. The God of the beast looked at the sword rain that was spreading all over the world, and he drank a lot. The huge evil spirits and monsters under his feet looked up at the sky and howled with a loud voice. But when he saw his hands open and close, his posture swayed, and his movements were primitive and clumsy. Even though he was far away, all the people on the Tongtian peak were listening to the extremely strange and desolate songs at the same time.</p>
<p>The song was quite different from that of the Middle Earth. It was desolate and majestic, like a wild beast roaring up to the sky on a stormy night.</p>
<p>With the sound of a low ancient sound, accompanied by the sound of clang drums, the black air around the beast god suddenly rises. It is as black as ink and flows rapidly in the wind. It looks like a black dragon with its teeth and claws. (to be continued. )</p>
