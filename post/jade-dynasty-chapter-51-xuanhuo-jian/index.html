      <p>In the distance, in the darkness of the woods, the creeping Monday fairy and Xiaohuan are hiding behind the tall trees, in the shadow, looking at all the people in the field.</p>
<p>Xiaohuan frowned and whispered, &ldquo;Grandpa, instead of running for your life, what are you going to do in this dangerous place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Monday, the fairy still looked at the scene and whispered, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard that there are many treasures in these monster caves, but they can&rsquo;t be used in the past. Today, it&rsquo;s not easy for many people to help us open the way. If we don&rsquo;t come to have a look, there may be oil and water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan&rsquo;s white face was not very angry: &ldquo;what if we don&rsquo;t touch the oil and water but meet the monster?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhou Yixian turned around and said with a smile: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s OK, Grandpa. I have the world-wide magic of earth, water and thousands of miles, which was passed down by the founder of qingyunzi. It&rsquo;s absolutely ok&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Small ring low voice way: &ldquo;cut, obviously is swindles the money not to run away the thing, also said what the world&rsquo;s magic!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhou Yixian didn&rsquo;t pay attention to the little granddaughter&rsquo;s words, but still triumphant: &ldquo;and you didn&rsquo;t give grandpa a look? It&rsquo;s said that Grandpa&rsquo;s heaven is full, there are money lines between his eyebrows, and the line of fortune in his palm is straight and thick, which is the face of the rich. Ha ha, it will come true tonight. Xiao Huan, grandpa has great confidence in your physiognomy! &quot;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan: &ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; On Monday, Xian suddenly seemed to be surprised. Turning to look at the field, he saw that Zhang Xiaofan had already bullied himself, and the fire stick was shining black, rushing towards the soft woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Taiji Xuanqing road! This young man is under the Qingyun gate. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; When Xiaohuan heard this, he became interested and looked at the scene. He saw the demon&rsquo;s voice was loud and the two sides were fighting endlessly. He asked the fairy on Monday, &ldquo;he is the same ancestor as us. Is he powerful?&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Monday, the immortal looked at it intently, and the fun of greedy money on his face gradually disappeared, his face gradually calmed down, and frowned: &ldquo;this young man is not old. But I think his magic power seems to have reached the fifth level of &ldquo;Yuqing realm&rdquo;, strange</p>
<p>Xiaohuan takes a look at Grandpa, but others don&rsquo;t know. But she knew that although Zhou Yixian was greedy for money, she drifted all her life. This insight was very important. At the moment, she said, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see that this man is a genius.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Monday, the immortal was silent for a moment, but shook his head slightly and said: &ldquo;I see the youth&rsquo;s qualification.</p>
<p>Poor can&rsquo;t be said to be bad, but at best it&rsquo;s only in the middle and the top, but it&rsquo;s definitely not the pioneering genius of the founder of green leaves. According to reason, with his qualification, it&rsquo;s impossible for him to make such a rapid progress in the cultivation of Taoism! &quot;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan stayed for a while. For a moment, she didn&rsquo;t know what to say, so she had to turn around and keep looking into the field.</p>
<p>The stone thundered and rebuked on the ground, and the golden light twinkled. The demons avoid four times. Zhang Xiaofan rises from the sky, and the firestick alternates the blue light and the black light, and rushes to the soft and charming woman.</p>
<p>The woman only looked at him with eyes like water. The white long sleeves were waved out, but they were against the fire stick. They rushed forward. In a twinkling of an eye, they were close to each other.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was shocked, only looking at the woman&rsquo;s face, which was already very soft, close at hand. The faint fragrance comes from the dark, and the moving eyes in the night are as beautiful as agate and jadeite. Reflecting his own figure, I couldn&rsquo;t help shaking my heart for a while.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you see in that well?&rdquo; Even at the critical moment of this fighting method, the voice of the woman seems to be still soft and charming, soft to the ear.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s heart was in turmoil. His mind was almost seized by it. At a critical moment, his face suddenly flashed gold, and he immediately calmed down.</p>
<p>Three tail fox eyebrows a wrinkle, but only see Zhang Xiaofan big drink, in the air to fly out a few feet away, fell to the ground, and stone side by side.</p>
<p>Stone looked at him, some worry tunnel: &ldquo;the law of this evil fox is quite powerful, to be careful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan nodded with lingering fear. They looked up into the air, but saw three foxes still standing in the air, their clothes dancing with the wind, just like the people in the picture, very beautiful.</p>
<p>In the distance, on Monday, the immortal frowned and said in surprise, &ldquo;this young man is so determined! Under the five hundred years&rsquo; practice of foxing by three foxes, I can calm my mind! &quot;</p>
<p>Small ring is a corner of the mouth a turn, way: &ldquo;that has what, you didn&rsquo;t see that big man also seem to be OK general?&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Monday, the immortal said: &ldquo;what do you know? That big man has some connections with Buddhism. The Buddhism Dharma is the most important way to calm down. It&rsquo;s natural to resist the fox charm.</p>
<p>However, Qingyun gate is a Taoist school, which is far from satisfactory. It is rare for this young man to have this concentration in his practice! &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it?&rdquo; Xiaohuan thought for a while, then looked into the field.</p>
<p>Three tail fox slowly fell from the air, although there is still a smile on his face, but his eyes have gradually heavy color. Only in that moment, she and these two people fought fiercely. She realized that although they were not old, they were not low in Taoism. The big man&rsquo;s Taoism seemed to come from the Buddhist family, which was a headache.</p>
<p>Another young man&rsquo;s ambition was unexpectedly firm. His most handy skill of flattery seemed to be hard to use.</p>
<p>Baguio stood aside and was about to make a move, but seeing that Zhang Xiaofan was back to normal, she stopped and watched coldly.</p>
<p>The moon is cold, through the leaves, sprinkled on that soft and beautiful woman, see some lonely figure.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of bleak.</p>
<p>She lowered her head slightly, her long and thin eyelashes seemed to cover her weak mind, and she listened to the faint voice of the woods in the middle of the night. She said softly, &ldquo;I have no hatred with you. Why do you want to kill me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>One step ahead of the stone, the whole man looked like a fierce tiger, and shouted, &ldquo;You evil spirit, you are ruining the world, and the people in Xiaochi town are scared. Isn&rsquo;t it damned?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked up. There is a wind, gently blowing, blowing her cape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want to kill me because I am a demon?&rdquo; She looked at Zhang Xiaofan and looked deeply: &ldquo;how about you! What are you doing for? &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan didn&rsquo;t even think about it, and said, &ldquo;you are evil. I&rsquo;m a man in the right way. It&rsquo;s incumbent on me to eliminate harm for the people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Three tail fox silence for a moment, a faint smile, suddenly said: &ldquo;young Lang, how old are you this year?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan stayed for a while, frowned and said, &ldquo;what do you want to do with this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gently raised her hand and carefully tidied up the disordered hair that had fallen on the sideburns. Her green and jade fingers crossed the black hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These words are from your righteous masters! Monsters like us have always been for the sake of the world. It must be eradicated, right? &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan frowns. That&rsquo;s the teaching of the school. Just listen to the three evil foxes on the opposite side continue: &ldquo;but if I say, these words are wrong. What would you think? &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan snorted, dismissive, just about to refute and start, but in the moment of lightning and flint, in his mind. Suddenly, I skimmed over the words I talked with thousands of people on that day, and the people on board were shocked and stunned for a while.</p>
<p>Is what I know necessarily right?</p>
<p>What is the real heaven and justice?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be careful!&rdquo; Suddenly, the stone beside was drinking loudly. The wind broke out and the demon made a loud sound.</p>
<p>Three evil foxes are in Zhang Xiaofan a Zheng God, suddenly flying up. The palm of white jade is made into five sharp claws, which come from the sky. There was a roar from the stone, which was about to resist the law. But it was between the lightning and the fire stone. There was a demon sound around. In the dark paint, countless demon eyes twinkled and the wind was harsh. I don&rsquo;t know how many monsters came. At that time, it was a lack of skills.</p>
<p>Sanwei demon fox identified Zhang Xiaofan as the weaker one of them. Once it was decided, he drove the monster to entangle the stone first, and tried his best to solve it first.</p>
<p>See the wind speed. When the claw reached the young man&rsquo;s eyes, it seemed that there was a low voice of surprise in the distance. But suddenly, Zhang Xiaofan raised his head, and three evil foxes met his eyes. He felt a move in his heart, but he had no time to think about anything. He saw only between himself and Zhang Xiaofan, a black stick with a faint dark blue light suddenly appeared.</p>
<p>The next moment, her claws collided with the stick.</p>
<p>No one can describe that feeling. When outsiders looked at it, they didn&rsquo;t even expect the earth shaking movement. At that moment, they only saw the woman in the middle of the sky with her skirts floating and fingers clawing, and grasped the black fire stick.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, her snow-white skin seems to have lost its color completely. It&rsquo;s cold and white, almost transparent.</p>
<p>In front of her, it seemed like a demon vortex that could not see the bottom deeply. She was circling in the night and was about to devour her with a grim smile.</p>
<p>She raised her head, screamed, and her voice was shrill. Then the whole person rose to the sky and turned into a white figure. Finally, she broke away the blue halo like the devil and landed in the distance.</p>
<p>Then she looked back, shocked, killed, and stared at the young man, and the burning stick that was turning slowly in the air.</p>
<p>In the distance, Xiaohuan took a breath of cool air and said softly, &ldquo;what a powerful magic weapon! What is this! Grandpa? &quot;</p>
<p>She asked twice, but found that Monday fairy did not answer at all, turned to look at him, saw Monday fairy frown tight, but also a face of consternation.</p>
<p>Xiaohuan was surprised, reached out to pull Monday fairy, said: &ldquo;Grandpa, what&rsquo;s the matter with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The immortal shakes for a while on Monday. He seems to wake up from the picture just now, but his face is still uncertain. Nah, he says, &ldquo;who is this young man? How can such a strange disciple come out under the Qingyun gate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan glanced at him and said, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Monday, the immortal looked at the field and said, &ldquo;the magic weapon in the young man&rsquo;s hand is very strange. When he was sacrificing it, the evil spirit was even more powerful than that of three evil foxes. How could such evil things&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan opened her mouth wide and looked at the scene. Suddenly she saw the light from the corner of her eyes and whispered to the fairy on Monday: &ldquo;Grandpa, look at that woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Monday, the fairy was stunned, and looked down Xiaohuan&rsquo;s fingers, but saw the green green clothes of Biyao, standing silently on one side, beside the stones and the demons fighting happily, earth shaking, but she did not look there, a pair of eyes only looked at Zhang Xiaofan.</p>
<p>Especially after seeing Zhang Xiaofan sacrificing the fire stick, his face was even more strange, as if he was happy, worried, hesitant and uncertain.</p>
<p>On Monday, the fairy looked twice and said, &ldquo;that woman is interested in the fire stick. What are you looking at, little girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Small ring strange way: &ldquo;what fire stick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the boy,&rdquo; said the fairy on Monday</p>
<p>Xiao Huan was not convinced, and said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s strange why she is interested in that boy, but I can&rsquo;t watch it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Monday, Xian stared at her and was about to teach the disobedient and precocious granddaughter a good lesson. Suddenly, there was only some movement in the audience. He turned around and looked at it, and never cared about Xiaohuan again.</p>
<p>In the field, Zhang Xiaofan saw the fox retreat, a great opportunity. Naturally, we can&rsquo;t miss it. In a twinkling of an eye, we&rsquo;ve bullied ourselves into it. The fire staff roared, and the three Tailed Fox frowned. His face seemed white again.</p>
<p>Seeing Zhang Xiaofan rushing, the night was more intense, the wind was more urgent, and the woman&rsquo;s soft face was covered with two light eyebrows. It seems to be locked up. Just listen to her chiding, sleeve robe flying, white jade fingers stretching and bending, and fingers like knives, flying off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Roaring like a mountain, suddenly, like a needle, pierced into everyone&rsquo;s eardrum.</p>
<p>In the dark forest, suddenly burst out countless dark awns. Looking carefully, it was from the dark place behind the woman. Like the tide, countless monsters burst out, screamed and rushed to Zhang Xiaofan.</p>
<p>In a flash, Zhang Xiaofan was almost submerged by the monster.</p>
<p>People lost their color, but just a moment later, they saw that Zhang Xiaofan was among the black and oppressive monsters. When he walked with the stick, he came out of the crowd. After the blue light of the fire staff, in addition to some monsters with a slightly larger body and some Taoism, they dare to resist. Other monsters dare not come forward.</p>
<p>This time, the crowd was even more shocked, but when Zhang Xiaofan tried his best to cast the Dharma, his heart was suddenly bitter: this &ldquo;soul absorption&rdquo; was to burn the spirit of the monsters to refine them, looking at the fear of these monsters in the face of the burning stick instinct at the moment. I&rsquo;m afraid most of what those ten thousand people say is true.</p>
<p>Sanwei demon fox saw the numerous monsters, but it seemed that Zhang Xiaofan could not be stopped, and his face was even paler. Just then, in the roar of the stones in the distance, the golden light flickered. Solemnly and solemnly, from a distance, it looks like the powerful King Kong of subduing the devil. He opens his eyes, stares at his eyes, rises up, and plunges the staff of breaking the evil spirit into the ground again.</p>
<p>In the &ldquo;roaring&rdquo; sound, the golden light is everywhere. This time, the scope of the collapse of the surrounding area is larger, reaching three Zhangs, and the golden light from the flash is also dazzling, such as lightning and thunder.</p>
<p>In the wailing sound, half of the monsters surrounding the stone suddenly turned into nothing, and most of the rest escaped in a big surprise.</p>
<p>When the stone falls to the ground, the huge body will gasp for breath as soon as it stands. Obviously, such powerful spells will also consume a lot of his body&rsquo;s magic power. But after all, he was strong and seemed to breathe slowly in a flash. Although he still had some asthma, he looked around and rushed to Zhang Xiaofan.</p>
<p>After seeing the stone coming, Zhang Xiaofan was not far away. He wanted to get out of the dark behind him.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, just at this time, the white light flashed in the dark, and suddenly flew out of the vast white flowers. The wind was fierce, and the three evil foxes were frightened. They did not dare to move lightly for a while, so they had to stop.</p>
<p>At a glance, it was the young woman who had been standing nearby in water green clothes. I don&rsquo;t know when she has broken her way. The flying flowers in the sky are like snow. Now they are converging and circling to her side. Under the cold moonlight, they gradually form a lovely flower, which is sandwiched in her beautiful fingers.</p>
<p>Behind her, there was a sound of footsteps. When she looked back, she saw that Zhang Xiaofan and the stone had already come here, forming horns and surrounding her in the middle.</p>
<p>The original little demons, at the moment, are all gone. She is the only one left. She seems to be standing silently surrounded by these human beings with some loneliness.</p>
<p>She opened her mouth slightly, as if with some regret, but did not say anything. Even in this moment, her soft face still has unparalleled gentle beauty, never lost a cent.</p>
<p>She looked at Baguio and stone, but at last, her eyes, soft as water, still fell on Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan is alert.</p>
<p>She did not move anything, but gently asked a: &ldquo;young man, just in that well, what did you see, can you tell me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The people around were all in a daze. They didn&rsquo;t think what the evil spirit was for, but they were so interested in what Zhang Xiaofan saw in the well. Zhang Xiaofan hasn&rsquo;t spoken yet, and the stone has said loudly: &ldquo;brother Zhang, don&rsquo;t be fooled by her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan nodded and said that he was silent. As soon as he raised his right hand, he would rush up.</p>
<p>Three evil foxes looked at him and sighed softly.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan suddenly lost his mind.</p>
<p>The moonlight is like water, shining gently.</p>
<p>The woman looked down at the shadow, her fine eyelashes covering her soft eyes.</p>
<p>The eyes are like water.</p>
<p>Then, she looked up, reached out, entered her arms, and slowly took out a thing.</p>
<p>The crowd looked at it.</p>
<p>This is a half palm sized thing, in a round shape. Outside is a green jade ring, green and dripping. You can see it&rsquo;s not ordinary. In the middle of the jade ring is inlaid with a small mirror like, non mirror, red flake, and in the middle is carved with a shape of ancient flame totem.</p>
<p>For the whole thing, the jade ring accounts for most of it. On both sides of the jade ring, there is a red silk spike tied to the ring.</p>
<p>On Monday, Xian stayed. She really stayed. Xiaohuan felt that her grandfather had never been as motionless as wood.</p>
<p>She was afraid. She quietly pulled Monday fairy&rsquo;s sleeve and said, &ldquo;Grandpa, what&rsquo;s wrong with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How, how?&rdquo; On Monday, the immortal stared at the strange magic weapon in the hands of three evil foxes, with a voice like * *, saying: &ldquo;this is clearly the treasure of the town of&rdquo; burning incense Valley &ldquo;-&rdquo; xuanhuojian &ldquo;! This magic weapon is the most powerful thing in the world. It&rsquo;s also the most powerful weapon in burning incense Valley for thousands of years. How and how can it be in the hands of this demon fox? &quot;</p>
<p>Small ring Zheng for a while, can&rsquo;t help but look at that Xuan fire Jian a few eyes, way: &ldquo;that magic weapon has so fierce?&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Monday, the immortal suddenly took a long breath, Nah, Nah, Nah, Nah, Nah, the world has really changed. The disciples of the orthodox school are holding evil things that are evil and oppressive. The devil is holding the supreme artifact</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cut, why do I think you are feeling?&rdquo; Xiaohuan sniffs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you say?&rdquo; said the fairy angrily on Monday</p>
