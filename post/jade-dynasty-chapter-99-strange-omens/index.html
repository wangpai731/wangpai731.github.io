      <p>It rained in the sky.</p>
<p>The rain is not big, and the sky is a little yellow. It has been raining for the second day in a row.</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai frowned tightly, turned his head suddenly, and said to the nearby man, &ldquo;younger martial sister Yan, do you have any discovery?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Yan Hong in the burning incense Valley who stood with him. Xiao Yicai entered the neize after all the people were separated in the miasma on that day. Because of the different directions, he didn&rsquo;t meet FA Xiang, Lin Jingyu and other people. However, he soon met Yan Hong nearby. Although he was not in the same door, he was also very kind. These days, he went together in groups.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that they have been looking for a few days in this boundless forest, but they still haven&rsquo;t found anything. Besides trees or trees here, it&rsquo;s raining all the time. There are countless poisonous insects on the ground. It&rsquo;s really a headache. Sometimes, if you think about it, it&rsquo;s no wonder that there&rsquo;s no smoke here, where people live!</p>
<p>Nevertheless, what should be done should be done. Xiao Yicai and Yan Hong are searching carefully nearby. At the same time, they are aware that although Yan Hong is very polite to her, she seems to be on guard.</p>
<p>When he saw what Yan Hong seemed to see at the moment, he kept staring at a place in the forest. He couldn&rsquo;t help but ask her. When Yan Hong heard it, he suddenly said, &ldquo;look there, elder martial brother Xiao. It seems that it&rsquo;s strange.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai was startled. Looking at Yan Hong&rsquo;s fingers, he saw a faint golden flash behind the layers of rain, between the thick branches and leaves, and then disappeared.</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai&rsquo;s heart was moving, but he saw that the golden light had passed for a long time, which only flashed a little bit, but the distance seemed to be a little too far.</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai and Yan Hong have a look at each other. Almost at the same time, both of them think of the hearsay about the omen of the strange treasure. It&rsquo;s the huge golden light that rushes straight to the sky. Isn&rsquo;t it</p>
<p>A moment later, they both soared up almost at the same time and rushed to the golden light.</p>
<p>But in the moment of flying, they seem to subconsciously leave each other far away. At the same time, they secretly control the magic weapon tightly and do not know how to guard against the unknown danger. Or the danger around</p>
<p>The two of them flew so fast that they soon reached the glittering neighborhood, avoiding the thick branches and leaves, and there was a mess under the forest. There are scattered broken brambles everywhere, even on the thick tree trunk beside, there are many scars. What&rsquo;s more, the big tree in front of which one person hugs unexpectedly fell several trees.</p>
<p>Forest.</p>
<p>This mess goes straight to the front. It looks as if someone or monster is giving power here, making a way in the dense forest.</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai and Yan Hong look at each other and see that there is a faint color of consternation in each other&rsquo;s eyes. At this time, in front of the forest, there was a murmur again. Xiao Yicai signaled to Yan Hong. They flew gently, concealed in the branches and leaves, and flew forward secretly.</p>
<p>For a while. All the way up there are many fallen trees and many dead animals. Most of them can&rsquo;t dodge and suffer from the disaster. And the noise in front is getting louder and louder, and there is also a sound of Buddha chanting in the middle.</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai was stunned, and said to himself, &ldquo;is this the elder martial brother Faxiang of Tianyin temple?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a moment of hesitation, I saw a golden light suddenly lit up in front of me, a roar came, like a tangible sound wave vibrating and roaring, all the trees around me trembled together. Power is not small.</p>
<p>But Xiao Yicai&rsquo;s face changed. In the &ldquo;Buddha&rsquo;s roar of subduing the devil&rdquo;, there was a sense of anxiety and urgency. Look at this situation. But it&rsquo;s not good. The relationship between Tianyin temple and Qingyun gate is not better than burning incense valley. Xiao Yicai ponders a little and finally rushes out. After a while, the wind rings, but Yan Hong follows.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s both in the air. The situation in the field was all in a daze, followed by a big surprise.</p>
<p>I saw that there was indeed a monk wearing the robe of Tianyin temple, but it was not the gentle Dharma, but the big Dharma. At the moment, I saw the monk robe of Fasan&rsquo;s whole body bulging high. In his hand, a huge &ldquo;King Kong subduing wand&rdquo; was dancing like a storm. It was glittering and covered his whole body. At the same time, his mouth was roaring from time to time.</p>
<p>But in front of him and his hands, but a beautiful woman in yellow clothes, eyes and brows, mouth corner smile, black hair gently floating shoulder side, a pair of eyes filled with water, a look, it seems to be immersed in it, no longer want to come out.</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai just looked at her two eyes, and suddenly there was a stir in his heart. He only felt that there was only this woman in the world, and he really wanted to be with her all his life.</p>
<p>Fortunately, he had been practicing for many years. He was a Taoist. He woke up suddenly and was shocked. He said to himself, &ldquo;where is the fairy from? She has such a strong heart enchanting skill!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the eyes of Xiao Yicai and Yan Hong, although the momentum of FA Shan is frightening, they all see that his face is red. In fact, he has been forced to be trapped by the beautiful woman in front of him. If there is no foreign aid, he will not be able to survive for half an hour.</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai and Yan Hong are both secretly shocked. However, they can&rsquo;t remember who this woman is. The Taoist practice is so high that they can beat one of the most outstanding disciples in Tianyin Temple besides the Dharma phase, Dharma Shan, with little power to fight back.</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai and Yan Hong look at each other and scold each other. They rush down and take control of the famous Seven Star Sword of Qingyun gate, which connects to Tianfeng. It turns into a white light and splits at the head. On the other hand, Yan Hong also sends out a Green Qi. It&rsquo;s her magic weapon, qinglingshi, that follows her closely.</p>
<p>The woman in the yellow dress suddenly heard the sound of scolding on her head. As soon as her face changed, there seemed to be a thin anger on her face. It was just that all kinds of customs, as if the light anger had also turned into a touching beauty, which was written on her face lightly, attracting people&rsquo;s soul.</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai, after all, is the first disciple of Qingyun sect. He has a high level of Taoism, which is not comparable to ordinary people. Seven Star swords are everywhere. They have stretched out their swords in the air and beheaded. The woman frowned and dared not despise the enemy. Then she saw another woman behind her. Her way seemed to be not low. Now she had to go back. At the same time, her right hand moved in a row and suddenly grabbed the ground. Suddenly, the purple light shone in the air, which was dazzling. She was blocking her body and colliding with the seven star sword and the green spirit stone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bang!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a muffled sound, the woman drifted back, and Xiao Yicai and Yan Hong also fell beside FA Shan. Xiao Yicai asked FA Shan in a low voice, &ldquo;are you OK, elder martial brother FA Shan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>FA Shan&rsquo;s face was red, and he gasped heavily. After a while, he slowly came back and said, &ldquo;look out, elder martial brother Xiao. This woman is the golden bottle of the joy sect of the demon sect. It&rsquo;s very tight!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both Xiao Yicai and Yan Hong were shocked. In recent years, Jin Ping&rsquo;er has been one of the most influential figures in the demon sect. He is regarded as one of the three princes together with Qin Wuyan and GUI Li, and is regarded as a serious problem by the people in the right way. See you today. She is such a gorgeous woman, but when she was first met, Xiao Yicai knew that she was a gold bottle from the Hehuan school.</p>
<p>Jinpinger stood in front of her. She was really annoyed. She had entered the dead zenezer. There was no clue in the search for many days. Today, I met a single monk, FA Shan of Tianyin temple. They didn&rsquo;t agree with each other, so they started.</p>
<p>Dharma has been practised for many years. In the young generation of Tianyin temple, apart from the Dharma phase of Tianzong wizards, they don&rsquo;t want to be the second person. But the gold bottle is even more powerful. Suddenly, it&rsquo;s like a silk eye. It&rsquo;s not because the Buddhism of Dharma Shan has a deep concentration, but it&rsquo;s also under the secret &ldquo;enchanting skill&rdquo; of the joy sect of the demon sect. Suddenly, he suffered a great loss. His mind was in turmoil for a while, and only 60% of his ten dharmas were left.</p>
<p>After that, under the attack of jinpinger, which seems to be understatement, but in fact is fierce, Fasan tries his best to protect himself, keep the Lingtai clear, and support it painstakingly. If xiaoyicai and Yanhong didn&rsquo;t arrive in time, just afraid that today&rsquo;s fashan would be subdued by jinpinger. In the past, the practice was completely abandoned, which was controlled by this enchanting magic. All my life, I listened to the order of the Golden Vase like a walking corpse.</p>
<p>At the moment, the Golden Vase looked at Xiao Yicai up and down, and suddenly smiled. Soft voice, soft voice way: &ldquo;this childe does not know and I have any hatred, it is so heavy hand, want to put the little girl to death?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai took a look at her, but saw her bright eyes like water, bright and crystal. It&rsquo;s exciting to see it shining like a star in the evening.</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai can&rsquo;t help but sweat in his palm, and he calms himself. He doesn&rsquo;t look into her eyes any more. Lang says: &ldquo;girl is the famous Golden bottle under the sect of the evil cult he Huan! I&rsquo;ve heard so much about it! &quot;</p>
<p>The Golden Vase smiled and said, &ldquo;Oh! Do you know me? &quot;</p>
<p>Xiao Yi said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m also a new girl today, but master Fasan is under the gate of Tianyin temple. He is the same person as our Qingyun gate. I should fight with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gold bottle son slightly frowns, immediately smile way: &ldquo;say so, want to ask childe is green cloud door which vein of high person?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai said: &ldquo;I dare not. I&rsquo;m Xiao Yicai from the Qingyun gate to the Tianfeng peak. This is Miss Yanhong from the burning incense valley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jin pinger&rsquo;s eyes turned around Yan Hong&rsquo;s face. Seeing that she was also pretty, she couldn&rsquo;t help looking twice more. Yan Hong is a Taoist among the young generation of incense valley. She has always been called Shuangbi together with Li Xun. However, she is a low-key person and does not want to make her debut. She has always had affairs that Li Xun does. At the moment, she followed Xiao Yicai down, and she never spoke.</p>
<p>At the moment, jinpinger glanced at her, and she couldn&rsquo;t help looking to jinpinger. Unexpectedly, under this look, she saw that the beautiful woman&rsquo;s skin was like snow, her eyebrows were beautiful, and her time was a little long. Even she couldn&rsquo;t help fainting in her mind, and couldn&rsquo;t help being startled. At the same time, her face was slightly red. It was shameless and evil sect magic. Her daughter&rsquo;s body would be confused!</p>
<p>When Xiao Yicai just came here, it was dusky evening. Now he was tossing again, and gradually it was dark again.</p>
<p>Jin Ping&rsquo;er Qiao stands there and confronts with Xiao Yicai and other three people. He secretly thinks: just now, Xiao Yicai&rsquo;s cultivation is not low, and there are two people beside him. Although he is not afraid of it, he is not yet born. It&rsquo;s unwise to fight with them.</p>
<p>At such a thought, she had the intention of going, where Xiaoyi just looked at her face, suddenly stepped on a step, was about to say something, but at this time, in the deep of the dead water, the rain continued to rain in the distance, suddenly came a loud sound like a tiger roaring and a dragon singing!</p>
<p>The sound is so loud that the roar of the Buddha just made by Fasan is just like that of a child, which is not worth mentioning at all.</p>
<p>In an instant, the wind and cloud in the sky changes almost at a visible speed, and the clouds are steaming. The scenes are like roaring waves, which really changes the color of heaven and earth.</p>
<p>People are shocked!</p>
<p>I just feel that the voice is like an awl pierced into my mind, but it is unstable.</p>
<p>A moment later, under the astonishment of all the people, in the dark depth of the distance, a bright golden light suddenly rose, gradually bright, gradually thick, and turned into a huge golden light column behind. In the roar, it rushed to the sky. Stab into the clouds, the sky and the earth will shine brightly in a flash, everywhere is the golden light, the clouds are the golden clouds. A tree is a golden tree!</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai, Jin pinger and other four people were awed by the wonders of the world. For a while, they forgot their hostile status and looked up one after another. They saw that the golden light column was more and more dazzling and bright, but at last it was almost invisible. The wind and cloud in the sky are even more violent and turbulent. They rotate rapidly around the golden light column, forming a huge vortex illuminated by the golden light.</p>
<p>Under such spectacular scenes, the heaven and the earth are solemn, as if there are some most precious things in them, which makes people feel respected.</p>
<p>After a long time, the sudden golden light stopped slowly, and then quickly weakened. Suddenly, it came and went quickly.</p>
<p>Just for a while, just now, the scene of earth shaking and thundering has been like the water absorption of a long whale back to the dark.</p>
<p>After the dazzling brilliance, but more profound darkness than before came to the earth.</p>
<p>What clever people are Jin pinger and Xiao Yicai? They suddenly think that this is the sign of the birth of the strange treasure in the rumor. Now they see it with their own eyes. The sign of the birth of the strange treasure is so powerful that it can be described by the four words &ldquo;fantastic&rdquo;. I don&rsquo;t know what the strange treasure should be?</p>
<p>In contrast, the current dispute is too insignificant, almost coincidental. Jin pinger, Xiao Yicai and Yan Hong are flying at the same time, flying towards the golden light column just now. Only FA Shan is a little slow, but it is also close behind.</p>
<p>In the dark. They turned into four millirays and galloped away. Although the golden light column just now was too large to distinguish the specific location, the birth of the strange treasure was obviously in front of them. At the thought of this place, these people who are hard to cultivate in the cultivation way, how can they not be excited?</p>
<p>In the other corner of the dead area, the strong wind driven by the golden light column blows the dense forest branches and leaves to one side. Only the green dragon and Youji standing at the top of the tree, floating with the wind, are unmoved.</p>
<p>As the spectacular spectacle of heaven and earth slowly converged, Qinglong took a long breath and sighed: &ldquo;the heaven and earth are created endlessly, which is beyond the reach of ordinary people like me. I used to be confident of my erudition, but now when I see this spectacle, I know that everything in the world is really beyond heaven! &quot;</p>
<p>You Ji slowly takes back her eyes. Because the black veil covers her face, she can&rsquo;t see her appearance clearly. Only after listening to her for a long time can she say: &ldquo;the golden awn will come out in the world, and the yellow bird will come out.&rdquo; this is the inscription engraved on the volong Ding. But the yellow bird is an ancient beast, the nine heavenly birds. Even the &ldquo;different spirits and spirits&rdquo; in the ancient volume are also amazed at it. Can we really deal with it? &quot;</p>
<p>Qinglong smiled and said, &ldquo;three younger sisters, why do you worry so much. At that time, on Liubo mountain in the East China Sea, the leader of the king of ghosts first used the &ldquo;trapped dragon Que&rdquo; engraved on the tripod of Fu long. With the ancient magic power of Fu long tripod, he took Kui Niu, a strange beast, and knew that the &ldquo;four spirits blood array&rdquo; on the tripod of Fu long had the miraculous effect. Now that everything is ready, even the leader of the ghost king is at ease to let us come. What are you worried about? Don&rsquo;t you believe in the leader of the ghost king? &quot;</p>
<p>Youji was silent for a long time, and youyou said: &ldquo;I have always respected the master&rsquo;s great talent, and how can I doubt it.</p>
<p>However, I always think that there is no need for us to go to such strange and unpredictable things as &ldquo;four spirit blood array&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Qinglong&rsquo;s face changed, he suddenly stopped and said, &ldquo;three younger sisters, it&rsquo;s not for you and me to talk about things like this. In the future, in front of outsiders, don&rsquo;t talk about it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Youji&rsquo;s veil moved and looked at Qinglong. He frowned tightly and nodded slowly.</p>
<p>Qinglong was relieved, and then said slowly: &ldquo;three younger sister, don&rsquo;t blame me for being verbose. In fact, over the years, especially after Miss Biyao&rsquo;s accident, the spirit of the king of ghosts has gradually changed. Although we still treat us politely and respectfully, I can see that his decision-making and killing heart are growing. After all, we are subordinates. It&rsquo;s hard to predict. We should be careful Some of them. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You Ji said quietly:&rdquo; yes, elder brother, I know</p>
<p>Qinglong looked at her, then slowly turned around. After a long silence, he suddenly said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where he is now in the dead water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You Ji is behind him, looking forward. At the moment, she can only see the vast darkness. The golden light that just shocked the world is gone. There is only darkness left. She can&rsquo;t help but ask: &ldquo;elder brother, the Lord of the ghost king doesn&rsquo;t always trust the ghost. Why didn&rsquo;t you tell him that we would come here and our intention?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Qinglong looks at Youji and doesn&rsquo;t speak.</p>
<p>You Ji seemed to be stunned. She seemed to think of something. Then she looked up slightly, looked at the distance, listened to her voice, and floated low: &ldquo;can&rsquo;t you say&hellip;&rdquo; (to be continued. )</p>
