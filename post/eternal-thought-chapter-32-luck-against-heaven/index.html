      <p>[broadcast] students who pay attention to &ldquo;starting reading&rdquo; and get the first-hand news of 515 red envelopes can show their skills this time.</p>
<p>Not only are the hearts of the people around complicated, even Du Lingfei is jealous of Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s luck. Chen Ziang and others are the same. The four of them have entered the top five, and each battle has its own consumption. If this time, the four of them have got the qualification of being in the air and have a rest, they will certainly have a great advantage in the later battles.</p>
<p>Elder sun looked at Bai Xiaochun with a smile and didn&rsquo;t care. As for Li Qinghou, he looked as usual.</p>
<p>Soon, under Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s lively appearance, Du Lingfei&rsquo;s four men started a war. Du Lingfei&rsquo;s opponent, with a fierce hand, obviously often went out to carry out some tasks of killing fierce animals. He had seen the blood. He was also afraid of Du Lingfei&rsquo;s lifting heavy weights here. His whole body was not only protective, but also fast.</p>
<p>The two men&rsquo;s battle, the eyes of the people around them can&rsquo;t turn their eyes off. From time to time, there are bursts of exclamations. They are frightened by the ferocity of the fighting between them. It&rsquo;s just In this exclamation, there was a sharp voice, which was very obvious, and had a momentum of leading the rhythm of the crowd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, good sword!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good move. It&rsquo;s not right. Turn back, come back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on Bai Xiaochun looked at her with great devotion and even slapped her sometimes. He didn&rsquo;t mean to do this, but he really felt that Du Lingfei&rsquo;s fight was very good. As for his mentality, he had not regarded himself as a contestant for a long time.</p>
<p>That appearance makes elder sun cough a few times. Li Qinghou on one side has no expression, but is helpless in the bottom of his heart. After all, Bai Xiaochun has fulfilled his requirements.</p>
<p>Du Lingfei was at the moment fighting a strong enemy and had no time to be distracted. Finally, after the battle lasted for about one stick of incense, Du Lingfei tried to lift heavy weights as light as light three times before winning.</p>
<p>However, most of her aura has been consumed in her body. After she got off the stage and was about to recuperate, she heard the exclamation of Bai Xiaochun. She thought that she had worked so hard to get into the top three, but the other party got the same result as herself without any effort. She was wronged and wanted to beat her up.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun blinked. He had already found that Du Lingfei didn&rsquo;t like himself. At the moment, he was also very aggrieved. He was looking at each other eagerly. Du Lingfei almost couldn&rsquo;t help it and wanted to move immediately.</p>
<p>Chen Ziang&rsquo;s battle was relatively relaxed. However, it took half a column of incense and consumed some aura to win.</p>
<p>For Bai Xiaochun here, his heart is the same kind of envy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first three are out. All three of you are outside Arrogant, come forward to choose the next round of sorting, sequence number three of the small ball, as a round, automatically enter the decisive battle Elder sun coughed and said that the proud son stopped for a while, waved his right hand, and the pocket appeared again.</p>
<p>This time, Chen Zi&rsquo;ang was the first to walk over and take out a small ball. Seeing that the number above was two, he sighed from the bottom of his heart and walked aside.</p>
<p>Du Lingfei took a deep breath and was about to move forward when she suddenly stopped and looked at Bai Xiaochun coldly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You come first!&rdquo; She spoke in a cold voice.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun is watching the excitement. When she hears Du Lingfei&rsquo;s words, she doesn&rsquo;t refuse. She goes forward directly and puts her right hand into her pocket. At the moment, Du Lingfei looks at Bai Xiaochun coldly. Not only is she like this, but all the surrounding disciples are watching one after another.</p>
<p>Even elder sun and Li Qinghou are like this.</p>
<p>In the full view of the public, Bai Xiaochun is a little shy. He really doesn&rsquo;t care how many sizes he takes out. He grabs a small ball at will and takes it out to have a look. He is also stunned.</p>
<p>Number three.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you asked me to take it first.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun coughs and looks at Du Lingfei.</p>
<p>Du Lingfei&rsquo;s eyes showed fierce, clenched his fist, and looked at Bai Xiaochun fiercely. Her chest heaved violently. She felt that she was about to explode in her body.</p>
<p>Chen Ziang opened his eyes wide, and the whole person was in a daze. He couldn&rsquo;t imagine how lucky a person was. Unexpectedly It&rsquo;s empty again.</p>
<p>The onlookers all around saw the ball in Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s hand one by one, and they could no longer suppress it. They were suddenly in an uproar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s empty again! His name is Bai Xiaochun, isn&rsquo;t he What luck is he in the end? He has been in vain twice</p>
<p>&ldquo;This shameless guy, he didn&rsquo;t do anything, he actually entered the decisive battle&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This kind of person can also make it to the finals. Damn it, if I have this kind of luck, so can I!&rdquo; When the four week people were in uproar, those who were eliminated from the competition were even more jealous.</p>
<p>Elder sun hesitated for a moment and looked at Li Qinghou. Li Qinghou sighed deeply. For Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s luck here, he was also convinced.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun felt that the atmosphere around her was not right. She laughed awkwardly. She quickly ran to the martial arts stage and stood in the outer door with an embarrassed look on her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I was going to throw in the towel&hellip;&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun looked at the ball in his hand and felt incredible.</p>
<p>Du Lingfei took a deep breath, and it took a long time to suppress all kinds of bitterness in her heart. When she saw Chen Zi&rsquo;ang, she had to calm down and concentrate. She had observed Chen Zi&rsquo;ang before and knew that she was a strong enemy.</p>
<p>Chen Ziang smiles bitterly and takes a deep breath. He looks at Du Lingfei seriously.</p>
<p>Since then, the most exciting way to use Qi&rsquo;s ping-pong method is to take out all the seeds in front of him.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Du Lingfei manipulated the flying sword and roared by. Even after a long battle, he took out a wooden sword again, and two flying swords shuttled back and forth, forming a scene of strangulation. In an instant, the fight reached its peak.</p>
<p>Both of them can&rsquo;t keep their mace and control the consumption of aura. The fight is becoming more and more serious.</p>
<p>Outside the stage, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s heart rippled and cheered one after another.</p>
<p>The battle lasted for half an hour. At last, there was a roar. Du Lingfei abandoned a wooden sword, which broke it into numerous wooden tips. With the speed of lifting heavy weights, he directly blocked all directions of Chen Zi&rsquo;ang and formed a unique killing. Chen Ziang was forced to retreat again and again. His aura was exhausted. With a long sigh, he chose to admit defeat.</p>
<p>Seeing the fierce war, the disciples around him showed their admiration for Du Lingfei. Even Chen Ziang rose as a result of the war.</p>
<p>Although he was defeated, he must be famous in the following days.</p>
<p>Elder sun was also quite satisfied, especially with Du Lingfei, and even moved his heart to accept him as a disciple.</p>
<p>Similarly, no matter what happened to Xiaobi, the name of Bai Xiaochun will also be spread out</p>
<p>When Chen Ziang&rsquo;s voice echoed, Du Lingfei was pale, standing on the stage, and her aura was almost exhausted. Now she took a deep breath, took out the pill and swallowed it. But she also understood that it was useless and could not make up for it. What she needs now is sitting on her knees for several hours. After all, she has fought four times in a row.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just Xiaobi&rsquo;s rule, it won&rsquo;t give students so much rest time. After all, it&rsquo;s just Xiaobi.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bai Xiaochun, come up to me!&rdquo; Du Lingfei gritted her teeth and looked at Bai Xiaochun outside. She wanted to take advantage of the fact that her aura was not completely exhausted, and directly solved the damned Bai Xiaochun who entered the decisive battle with her own luck.</p>
<p>As soon as Du Lingfei&rsquo;s words came out, all the people around looked at Bai Xiaochun, and all their eyes showed the meaning of schadenfreude. In their opinion, even if Du Lingfei was exhausted, it was as easy to clean up Bai Xiaochun, who won by chance.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun blinked and looked at Du Lingfei, who was a little unsteady. He suddenly felt that he seemed to be You can take the first place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This time, I can finally make a name for myself. After I go up, I will lift the weight as light as possible, and let everyone around me cry out.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun held her head high, and a picture of everyone&rsquo;s surprise appeared in her mind for a while, so she strode to stage martial arts.</p>
<p>But just at the moment when Bai Xiaochun came to the stage, Du Lingfei&rsquo;s eyes flashed, and her right hand pinched a finger. Suddenly, the wooden sword beside her rushed to Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>It is obvious that the sharp meaning is scattered, which makes it feel cold all around. Obviously, this is Du Lingfei&rsquo;s all-out attack at the moment, which makes the sword more powerful than usual.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more amazing is that Du Lingfei&rsquo;s body also rushed out in this moment, catching up with the flying sword. After pressing her finger on the handle of the sword, her body almost merged with the flying sword and became an integral whole. She went straight to Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>With a bang, the speed of the flying sword suddenly increased. The speed was even higher than that when fighting with Chen Zi ang just now. It set off a sharp howl, and even seemed to break the wind and turn into a rainbow. In an instant, it approached Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>All the people around were shocked, attracted by the sword and exclaimed in succession.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A sword flies a fairy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elder martial sister Du has actually practiced this kind of sword determination!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elder sun&rsquo;s eyes flashed suddenly, and Li Qinghou nodded slightly. Naturally, they could see that Du Lingfei&rsquo;s decision had not been practiced. Instead, when the aura oil in his body was exhausted, he forced it out. With a breath of aura, he managed to exert the power of the sword.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She put all her eggs in one basket and realized the meaning of this sword determination. Du Lingfei is good. This woman is actually more suitable for Qingfeng mountain.&rdquo; Li Qing showed his admiration in his eyes.</p>
<p>At this moment, all the disciples from other schools were shocked. It seemed that all the scenery in front of them was blurred. Only the figure of Du Lingfei and Feijian, which seemed to blend together, was particularly clear.</p>
<p>As the sword roared, people walked with the sword, which turned into an amazing blow. Du Lingfei looked tired, but her eyes showed a sharp light. She was very confident and confident that the sword would win.</p>
<p>At this time, when the flying sword and Du Lingfei approached Bai Xiaochun, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s eyes shrank, his whole body roared, whether the jade pendant or the charm, all burst out, forming a layer of protection, and his body quickly retreated.</p>
<p>However, this flying sword is obviously not a common product. It penetrates into the protection directly and passes layer by layer. Although the speed drops sharply, and the protective light curtain does not collapse, it still penetrates it completely, and the tip of the sword directly stabs Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>But it seems that there is no spare force. When he stabs Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s body, if he is stuck, with Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s retreat, the sword shakes with his body. From the damaged coat, you can see that there are layers of leather clothes inside.</p>
<p>Seeing this scene, all the people around were stunned and took a breath one by one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This Bai Xiaochun, he has protection on him</p>
<p>&ldquo;How afraid this guy is to die. As for it, a little monk is just a little bit. He not only protects magic weapons and charms, but also wears leather armor on his body!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Du Lingfei looks pale. She looks like a rabbit whose tail has been trampled on. She not only flies fast, but also inserts her own flying sword. She clenches her teeth and pinches the key to control the flying sword to pull it back. However, her aura has been exhausted, and there is only a trace left. At this moment, no matter how she controls it, the flying sword is shaking, but it can&rsquo;t be pulled out.</p>
<p>In the end, Du Lingfei was in a hurry. Before she could pull the sword back, the corner of her mouth was full of blood. She staggered back a few steps and sat on the ground with pale complexion and dried up completely.</p>
<p>Her heart rises infinite grievances, thinking that she has finally reached the top two after her hard work. However, Bai Xiaochun is so relaxed that she doesn&rsquo;t even use up her aura. Her inner resentment turns into anger and stares at Bai Xiaochun. If her eyes can kill people, Bai Xiaochun must be killed countless times. If she still has strength, she will even go up and bite Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun took a deep breath and retreated very fast. He didn&rsquo;t expect Du Lingfei to have this move.</p>
<p>And their own protection was actually broken down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His grandmother&rsquo;s, fortunately, when I came here, I had a lot of heart and wore seven or eight fur coats.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun looked down at the flying sword which was inserted on his shoulder. After penetrating the protection, the strength of the flying sword had been removed, and it was blocked by the tough leather clothes of seven eight swords. When it finally fell on his skin, the strength was very little.</p>
<p>With his immortal skin, he didn&rsquo;t even feel a mosquito bite.</p>
<p>White small pure heart has lingering palpitation, looked at the flying sword which the eye inserts on the shoulder, pulled down this sword, aimed at the eye, panted, sat there staring at her Du Lingfei.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elder martial sister, it&rsquo;s not right to throw treasures around. Do you want this sword? Since you don&rsquo;t want it, I&rsquo;ll take it. &quot; Bai xiaochunmei Zizi threw the flying sword in her hand into the storage bag, and then took out the small wooden sword. She was preparing to lift her weight as light as possible, so as to make everyone exclaim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&hellip;&rdquo; Du Lingfei saw that her flying sword was taken away by Bai Xiaochun, and her eyes were red. The whole person was going to be crazy and very angry. She was so angry that she fainted.</p>
<p>This is Xiaobi, the second person who was dizzy by Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why are you dizzy again?&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun looks at Du Lingfei who faints, holding a small wooden sword rather helpless.</p>
<p>Do you still have free appreciation tickets and starting coins for the children&rsquo;s shoes who are chasing the watch? The countdown of the 515 red envelope list is on. I&rsquo;ll draw a ticket, ask for the increase and appreciation ticket, and finally flush it!</p>
