      <p>At this moment, it was the next evening. Bai Xiaochun and Bai Xiaochun ran at a gallop. From time to time, they took out the jade slips and tried. But they could not contact zongmen. Although they were anxious, they had no way.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are enough pills. There are also some in the storage bags of the seven people killed by Bai Xiaochun. Although they are not as good as Lingxi clan, they are better than none at this time.</p>
<p>Under the maintenance of the pill, Du Lingfei and Hou Yunfei got up, suppressed the injury, and moved forward in the night with Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>Along the way, Bai Xiaochun was terrified. Any wind and grass movement would make him sweat. His mind was always tense, and his eyes were bloodshot. Especially, the pain on his body made him grin from time to time.</p>
<p>The pain is not unbearable. Compared with his practice of immortal longevity, the pain is just for the sake of cultivation. But now, he looks at many parts of his body, and he is worried that the injury will deteriorate and endanger his life, so he can&rsquo;t help but look sad.</p>
<p>If she had changed her routine, Du Lingfei would have despised Bai Xiaochun more and more. But now she has completely reversed her attitude, showing tenderness in her eyes and constantly comforting Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s OK. Younger martial brother Bai is not afraid. This injury looks serious, but actually it won&rsquo;t hurt your life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t move. I&rsquo;ll put some ointment on you&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Looking at Bai Xiaochun grinning, even in this crisis, Du Lingfei also covered her mouth and chuckled, with a trace of indescribable thoughts in the smile.</p>
<p>She knew that Bai Xiaochun was afraid of death, but the more she knew this, the more she was moved by Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s previous return. She felt that Bai Xiaochun had a kind of courage far superior to others.</p>
<p>This courage, condensed out a figure of iron and blood, in her unforgettable.</p>
<p>Under Du Lingfei&rsquo;s consolation, Bai Xiaochun can&rsquo;t help feeling proud. She secretly says that she&rsquo;s trying hard this time. She seems to be pretty good. This little beauty Du Lingfei is so gentle to herself.</p>
<p>Hou Yunfei looked at this scene with a smile in his eyes. In this escape, they had a rare trace of warmth, especially this kind of mutual dependence, which made the three people have a deeper relationship with each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we can go back to zongmen, younger martial brother Bai and younger sister Du, we will never forget this for our whole life.&rdquo; Hou Yunfei said solemnly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you can go back to zongmen&hellip;&rdquo; Du Lingfei&rsquo;s eyes showed a longing, but she quickly sighed and looked at Bai Xiaochun. Her heart was bitter. She knew that it was possible for her three people to go back alive this time It&rsquo;s really tiny.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun was also silent.</p>
<p>As time went by, two days later, the three people hardly had any rest, and they all ran at full speed. On the way, they took out the jade slips to pass the letter many times, but they failed all the time.</p>
<p>Hou Yunfei&rsquo;s injury was aggravated, Du Lingfei was also gradually pale, tired and injured, which made them haggard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity that we can&rsquo;t hide. We need to send a letter to zongmen as soon as possible. According to my estimation, the ceremony of Luochen family will be finished soon. Once it is finished The ancestor who built the foundation will appear in person. If we hide closely, we will surely die. &quot; Hou Yunfei sighed and said to Bai Xiaochun and Du Lingfei.</p>
<p>At this time, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s face suddenly changed. He took Du Lingfei and Hou Yunfei and ran straight to the side of the hill and squatted down.</p>
<p>Hou, Du two face color change, immediately stop voice.</p>
<p>Before long, suddenly, there was a rainbow in the sky. The rainbow was a blood mist. In the fog, there was a family member of the Luochen family with eight layers of condensation. They were looking down. Because Bai Xiaochun escaped in time, the people of the Luochen family did not stay here for long and left far away.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s heart was pounding. Looking at the distant figure of the other party, he saw more blood in his eyes. But he knew that he could not do anything unless he could kill the person immediately. Otherwise, more members of the Luochen family would appear soon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re catching up&hellip;&rdquo; Du Lingfei sighs from the bottom of her heart. She looks at Bai Xiaochun and hesitates for a moment. When she is about to say something, she is pulled by Bai Xiaochun and rushes forward.</p>
<p>Along the way, the three people became more and more silent, and the heaven and earth around them seemed to be repressed. It made people feel uneasy. It seemed that the shadow of death was getting bigger and bigger, and they had to crush them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We still have hope!&rdquo; Hou Yunfei suddenly said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As the founder of the Luochen family, although he is far more powerful than me, his array can&rsquo;t be boundless. My ancestor of Hou&rsquo;s family is also a friar of building foundation. I was lucky to see his old man arrange an array, which can cover thousands of miles. This needs to be branded with some nodes in advance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elder martial brother Hou means that even if the ancestor of the Luochen family prepares in advance, it will not be too much even if it exceeds ten thousand li!&rdquo; Du Lingfei&rsquo;s eyes showed light and said immediately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, so the further away we are from the Luochen family, the greater the chance of contacting zongmen with Yujian. As long as we send the news back to zongmen, we will be saved!&rdquo; Hou Yunfei said firmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten thousand miles, according to our speed, it will take * * days&hellip;&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun murmured, biting his teeth and moving on.</p>
<p>Along the way, they hid and hid. They met several figures of Luochen family members, each time in the special sensitivity of Bai Xiaochun to the crisis.</p>
<p>But this kind of high concentration of spirit, coupled with non-stop gallop, and pulling Du, Hou two people, his tired feeling more and more strong, his face also slowly pale.</p>
<p>The injuries of Hou Yunfei and Du Lingfei are getting more and more serious, and the speed is gradually slow. At the end of the day, Bai Xiaochun is almost the only one who pulls them forward</p>
<p>This time, Bai Xiaochun was more cautious. He was steady in character, careful and sensitive to danger. In his vigilance, he survived for three days.</p>
<p>In the past three days, Bai Xiaochun was exhausted and haggard. When she entered a valley, she did not take a few steps. She suddenly took Du and Hou behind a big stone, but she slowed down for a while. The sound of whistling came from the sky. Bai Xiaochun pushed the two of them and quickly retreated.</p>
<p>With a bang, a white light fell from the air and hit the stone directly. The stone collapsed and scattered. Hou Yunfei gushed blood, and Du Lingfei also spilled blood from the corners of his mouth. At this time, a cold hum came from the sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you are hiding here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I saw a disciple standing on the blood mist, holding a mirror in his left hand. At the moment, he patted the storage bag with his right hand, and a jade slip appeared in his hand. He was about to deliver a message.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let him carry the message!&rdquo; Hou Yunfei was anxious. Du Lingfei was pale and was about to use his flying sword.</p>
<p>At this time, the retreating Bai Xiaochun was pale, his body was shaking, his eyes were red, and he was biting his teeth fiercely. When he stepped back, his right leg trembled, all his Qi and blood condensed, and with a bang, the ground behind him was directly broken. His body rose from the ground, and the whole person leaped. The speed was so fast that he turned into a rainbow.</p>
<p>At the moment when the Luochen family members wanted to deliver the message, Bai Xiaochun rushed directly in front of him with a cry. As soon as the face of the Luochen family changed, they didn&rsquo;t have time to send the message. They immediately retreated. The mirror in their left hand suddenly flashed, and several white lights flew out and rushed to Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s eyes showed fierce light, but he didn&rsquo;t dodge at all. He let the white light burst on his body, and his body rushed forward. At the moment when the Luo Chen family members were shocked, he approached him, and the black light on his right hand twinkled, which directly jammed his neck and pinched him fiercely.</p>
<p>Break the lock!</p>
<p>With a click, the seven layers of the people&rsquo;s eyes widened, and the blood gushed out of his mouth. He breathed and died, and he did not have time to deliver the message.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun also spilled blood at the corner of his mouth at the moment. He grabbed the other party&rsquo;s storage bag and returned to Du Lingfei&rsquo;s side. He almost fell down and bit his tongue to fight hard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go He pulled to Du Lingfei and Hou Yunfei.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me go!&rdquo; Hou Yunfei suddenly opened his mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You two go, and you&rsquo;ll be much faster.&rdquo; Hou Yunfei looks at Bai Xiaochun and Du Lingfei and decisively opens his mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Younger martial brother Bai, you yourself&hellip;&rdquo; Du Lingfei looks at Bai Xiaochun deeply. Hou Yunfei&rsquo;s words, which she wanted to say a few days ago, are about to speak at the moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut up! I am so afraid of death people are desperate, you can&rsquo;t let me in vain, to walk together Bai Xiaochun roars and interrupts the words of Hou Yunfei and Du Lingfei, and pulls them out. They are silent and do not continue to speak. However, they are deeply moved.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun was more cautious, constantly changed direction, and avoided the pursuit of the Luochen family several times. Three days later, at dusk, there was lightning in the sky, and dark clouds filled the sky. Gradually, the rain fell, and the big rain fell on the earth, making the whole world heard the sound of noise.</p>
<p>When the cold air spread out, Hou Yunfei and Du Lingfei trembled. Excited by the cold, their faces became paler. Bai Xiaochun was worried. Knowing that they could not endure the cold, they found a cave and raised a fire.</p>
<p>After blocking the fire to prevent the light from showing, Bai Xiaochun sits cross legged and looks at Du Lingfei.</p>
<p>The fire made a sound of burning, and the warmth gradually dissipated the cold outside. Du Lingfei and Hou Yunfei gradually recovered, but they were still pale.</p>
<p>In this cave, three people are silent, all looking at the fire, everyone&rsquo;s heart rises tired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In three days, we will be able to escape thousands of miles away. Ha ha, when we return to zongmen and make such great achievements, how do you think zongmen will reward us?&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun broke the silence with a smile.</p>
<p>Du Lingfei looks at Bai Xiaochun with soft eyes.</p>
<p>Hou Yunfei wants to laugh, but when he opens his mouth, a mouthful of blood spurts out, his face is paler and his body is crumbling.</p>
<p>These days of escape, pills have been used up.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun immediately stood up and was about to go over to check. Suddenly, his face changed and his sleeve suddenly swung. When he was in front of the two people, the stones blocking the fire at the entrance of the cave were thrown away with great force!</p>
