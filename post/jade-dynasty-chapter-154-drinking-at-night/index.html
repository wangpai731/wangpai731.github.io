      <p>Huqishan, the ice stone chamber.</p>
<p>GUI Li silently looks at the Biyao lying on the ice stone platform, the woman sleeping in the curling white smoke. The corner of her mouth seems to always have a trace of smile. Can she still feel at the moment, but does she know that someone is guarding her side?</p>
<p>Or, in her heart, she had no regrets, so she fell asleep peacefully?</p>
<p>He never knew the answer and didn&rsquo;t dare to think about it. But every time he thought about it, he seemed to suffer a lot. However, his body is getting worse and worse now. Although he has learned three volumes of Tianshu Dharma, he has gradually understood the three dharmas of Buddhism, Taoism and demons. It seems that some of them are integrated into one. The Taoism is advancing day by day, but the blood sucking Demon power seems to be wandering in his body every day, like a lingering ghost, waiting for the final opportunity to die with him.</p>
<p>That cold feeling, GUI Li has already been familiar with can not be familiar with any more, from the youth to this moment, have been accompanied by their own feelings ah! Even if it is death, because it will feel cold and die like this!</p>
<p>He had a bitter smile in his heart, and finally took a look at Biyao. It was the third day that he was alone with her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take a rest. I&rsquo;ll be back to see you soon.&rdquo; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid. Your father and I are just leaving for a while. Even if I die, I will come back to see you before I die. &quot;</p>
<p>He looked at Biyao, and then he turned and walked out of the cold stone room. Smoke wafted behind him like a veil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boom!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The heavy stone door closed slowly behind him, and the little ash who had been waiting for him jumped to his shoulder with a whoosh. GUI Li reached out and touched Xiao Hui&rsquo;s head, nodded and walked out all the way. Along the way, he either reached to the wall corner, or turned many detours to fiddle with the mechanism. Along the way, all levels of mechanisms in the hall of ghost king in Huqi mountain were activated, and more than ten heavy stone gates were left.</p>
<p>In the hinterland of Huqi mountain, the sound of organs is everywhere at the moment, but there is only one ghostly figure. The others followed the ghost king to the wild temple three days ago. At the moment, Huqi mountain, cold and lonely, all the way out of the mountain. When the sun shines on my body, I can&rsquo;t help being shocked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boom, boom&hellip;&rdquo; The last stone gate closed slowly, covering up the huge mountainside. There was also a faint &ldquo;patter&rdquo; sound, which was heard in my ears. I know that it&rsquo;s the voice of the mechanism&rsquo;s reverse button. If the visitor doesn&rsquo;t know how to open the mechanism in the future, if he just wants to attack from outside and face the huge rock with tens of thousands of Jin, he has to behave like an immortal.</p>
<p>Warm sunshine on the body, lying on the shoulders of the small gray stretched out his arms, stretched a stretch, his mouth also yawned. GUI Li turned his head and looked at it, and said with a smile: &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter? You look so bored and drowsy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohui squeaked twice. The monkey turned his eyes over his face, then danced his hands and feet, and pointed out to the mountain. GUI Li laughed and said, &ldquo;you are bored. Well, it&rsquo;s so desolate here and there are few trees. No wonder you feel uncomfortable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Small ash immediately desperately nodded, jumped down from the ghost sharp shoulder, mouth squeak. dance with joy. GUI Li took a deep breath and looked back at the entrance of the cave where there was no trace. He looked back at Huqi mountain and nodded. &ldquo;Well, anyway, we have to wait for a month before we go in to visit Biyao. We can relax around during this period.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohui was overjoyed, bouncing on the ground, grinning. I&rsquo;m infected by it. The mood can not help but also a lot better, smile and curse: &ldquo;well, not up, or you will stay here yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Small gray head a shrink, &ldquo;whoosh&rdquo; of a dart back, a few times climbed up the ghost sharp shoulder, ha ha smile. Ghost Li shook his head, and there was a smile in the corner of his mouth. He turned his hand, and the familiar cold feeling came back to him. Ghost Li seemed to think of something and hesitated for a moment. Xiaohui is a little strange. Why doesn&rsquo;t he fly away? He squeaks twice. He looks back at it, then smiles faintly and says softly: &ldquo;life is lonely. Why do you want so much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little gray blinked twice, obviously not quite understood the two words that Gui Li suddenly uttered. However, GUI Li did not say anything more. When he turned his hand, the green light came out, and the soul eating magic wand was offered. He carried them one by one to the blue sky and left Huqi mountain.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>The nearest place to Huqi mountain is a small town 200 miles away from the northeast, called Sanfu town. Sanfu town has a small population, but there are still a few villages around it, which can hardly be regarded as lively.</p>
<p>In the past, in order to keep secret, the ghost King clan generally did not go to Sanfu town to purchase daily necessities, such as food, wine and so on. Instead, they went to further cities and towns to buy them, in case the orthodox or other sects of the evil cult would find out where the general hall was. However, many of them went to Sanfu town to have a rest before they returned to the mountain.</p>
<p>In the past, GUI Li and Xiao Hui also passed through Sanfu town. Although it was not many times, Xiao Hui was extremely clever and remembered firmly. As soon as he got out of Huqi mountain, Xiao Hui was waving his arms and shoulders, pointing to the direction of Sanfu town. Obviously, he wanted to go to Sanfu town for drinking and eating. Ghost Li shook his head, but did not say anything, turned a direction and flew to Sanfu town.</p>
<p>The distance of 200 Li is not far for those who fly in the sky. Between the blue sky and white clouds, but saw a faint through a bit of black light flickering flying, across the air.</p>
<p>Xiao Hui was lying restlessly on his shoulder, with his head tilted from time to time, and his long monkey tail swayed to and fro. I didn&rsquo;t know if he was thinking about the delicious food to be enjoyed. As he manipulated the soul devouring, he looked down at his feet. Naturally, there was no need to say much about Huqi mountain area. After leaving Huqi mountain range, the terrain was relatively flat, but the wilderness was quiet, and there was no people. Looking down from a high place, there was only a desolate ancient road extending alone on the wilderness, and I didn&rsquo;t know where to go?</p>
<p>GUI Li sighed suddenly, but he didn&rsquo;t say anything. He just looked at the master more than once.</p>
<p>After less than half an hour&rsquo;s flight to the northeast, they had already arrived at Sanfu town. Far away, they could see the houses below, one by one. Xiao Hui was excited, squeaking and pointing down. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said with a smile. We&rsquo;re going down. &quot;</p>
<p>The green light flashed and hissed in the air and fell from the sky onto the streets of Sanfu town. But it just landed. The brow of the ghost is already frowned. Xiao Hui jumped down from his shoulder, reached for his head, looked around, and was obviously confused. After a moment, it seemed to feel something, too. All three eyes lit up at the same time, squeaking and nervous.</p>
<p>The Sanfu town in front of us seems to have become an empty town. Most of the surrounding houses are still in good condition. Only a few places can be seen to be damaged, but the people in the whole town have disappeared completely. There was a dead silence over the town.</p>
<p>The ghost Li hums a, in the heart how many understood several points, needless to say. It&rsquo;s mostly because of the monster havoc. The people of the town either fled to the North earlier, and if they fled slowly, they would be hard to avoid becoming the food in the mouth of the demon. A good small town, changed to such a look. In the past, how many cities and towns are like this on the vast land of China?</p>
<p>There is a wind in the distance, blowing a little sand in the street. In such a warm day, the wind blowing in the town seems to be cold. Xiao Hui still seems a little upset. Close to the GUI Li, at the same time looking around, Guili bent down and picked up the small ash. He said in a low voice, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s OK.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Small gray eyes blinked, seems to be with the ghost, also quiet down. GUI Li took a deep breath, lifted his feet and walked forward slowly. Xiao Hui climbed on his shoulder and stopped making noise. Looking around quietly.</p>
<p>In addition to the wind, there was no sound in the town. After walking half the street, I saw that some of the doors and windows of each family were closed, while others were open. I didn&rsquo;t know whether they were intruded by the monster. However, we didn&rsquo;t see the corpse all the way. It seems that the people here got the news in advance, so most of them fled to the north.</p>
<p>At this time, a sudden gust of cold wind blowing, the left side of the street a crumbling door &ldquo;bang&rdquo; fell down, hit the ground, issued a loud sound, echoed in the empty street. GUI Li and Xiao Hui turned their heads at the same time. Behind the door, an arm fell on the board weakly, motionless. At the same time, there was a faint smell of blood in the air.</p>
<p>GUI Li looked at that direction silently for a while, then turned his head and continued to walk forward. Xiao Hui was lying on his shoulder, but he looked back at the arm from time to time.</p>
<p>GUI Li has been to Sanfu town several times before, so I know something about the situation here. He walked slowly and was silent for a long time. Then he said, &ldquo;I remember a tavern ahead. Let&rsquo;s go there. Maybe we can find you something to eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Hui squeaked twice.</p>
<p>The sound of footstep on the street seems to be very loud at the moment. The cold wind blows from behind. Soon, along the street, they come to the front of the tavern. The sign of the tavern had fallen off the doorpost and was covered in dust. GUI Li took a look at the wooden plaque with unknown name, stepped on it and left a footprint on it.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, Xiao Hui made a low cry, staring at the inside of the tavern, and his ghostly body suddenly stopped. A moment later, there was a low roar from the tavern.</p>
<p>Is it a monster? This is the first response of the ghost, but the roar sounds familiar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roar&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Hui suddenly let out a scream and ran into the tavern. He was startled. I don&rsquo;t know why Xiaohui was suddenly excited. However, Xiao Hui has always been very close to him and can be said to be his only partner. No matter what, he can&rsquo;t let Xiao Hui face the mysterious things in the Tavern alone. Seeing that Xiaohui was about to enter the tavern in a blink of an eye, his face changed and his figure swayed. He had already chased in.</p>
<p>The next moment, he appeared in the tavern. When he saw the things in the tavern clearly, he couldn&rsquo;t help being stunned.</p>
<p>In the tavern, pots and pans are scattered all over the place. There are piles of fragments. The original tables and chairs are also disorderly. A few of them are still in good condition. Thick dust can be seen on the tables and chairs. But it was in such a dilapidated tavern that a pot of wine and several wine glasses were placed on a table in the middle of the tavern. Next to him was a young man in bright silk clothes. In the open space between him and GUI Li, a monster and Xiao Hui were confronting each other. The appearance was ferocious and terrifying, and the roar was low with a trace of astonishment. It was the evil beast &ldquo;Taotie&rdquo; 。</p>
<p>It turned out to be a mysterious young man who met with ghost in the wild mountains and deep forest that day.</p>
<p>Taotie has a long neck. Staring at the big eyes of four copper bells, Xiao Hui&rsquo;s expression is not as nervous as at the beginning, but a little happy. He squeaked twice, grinned and walked forward slowly, but he wanted to touch his head with his hands.</p>
<p>Gluttonous low roar, obviously to the small ash this movement some does not adapt. Xiao Hui stopped for a moment, his three eyes blinked, and walked around the body of the gluttonous beast twice, from the left to the right, and then from the right to the left. Taotie&rsquo;s long neck revolves and follows Xiao Hui&rsquo;s body. He makes a few low growls from time to time, but his hostility seems to be getting smaller and smaller. It is obvious that Taotie has a good feeling for this three eyed monkey.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s hard to meet a guy who is as greedy as it is, so I look at him differently</p>
<p>At this time, the young man also saw the ghost and did not move, but his expression seemed to be stunned for a moment. Obviously, he did not expect that he would meet GUI Li here. But he soon returned to normal, with a smile and a sharp nod. GUI Li&rsquo;s surprise was no less than that young man, and at the moment, he had more doubts about the identity of this mysterious young man. If he could appear in the tavern of such a dead town, his origin is unknown. It&rsquo;s weird.</p>
<p>At this time, Xiaohui is close to Taotie, and suddenly opens his mouth and smiles. He reaches out and pats Taotie&rsquo;s rough head. There was a low roar from the gluttonous mouth. Four eyes stare at Xiao Hui, and she looks fierce. However, Xiao Hui doesn&rsquo;t seem to be afraid at all. Instead, she thinks it&rsquo;s funny. She claps her hands twice and makes a weird and funny &ldquo;poop poop&rdquo; sound.</p>
<p>Taotie seems to have no way to take the monkey. Hit a snort, seem to be like a person can&rsquo;t help but hum a sound, lie down, no longer pay attention to small ash. Xiao Hui seems to like this monstrous monster very much. He moves around Taotie and touches him there. It looks like he is very intimate.</p>
<p>The mysterious boy took back his eyes from the two spirits, looked at the ghost and said with a smile, &ldquo;it seems that they are very good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He nodded his head and laughed a little.</p>
<p>As soon as the young man patted the chair beside him, he said, &ldquo;in fact, the two of us are quite predestined. The world is so big that we can still meet here. Why don&rsquo;t you come over and have a drink and have a chat. &quot;</p>
<p>GUI Li took a look at Xiaohui and Taotie, and saw that Xiao Hui&rsquo;s attention at the moment seemed to have been put on Taotie, and then he said faintly, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s OK.&rdquo; After that, he walked slowly, but he was not beside the boy. Instead, he took another chair and sat down on the other side of the table.</p>
<p>There was a faint smile on the handsome young man&rsquo;s face. He reached for a clean cup and put it in front of the ghost. Then he filled it with wine and said with a smile, &ldquo;brother, why are you here in this deserted and deserted town?&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li did not answer, looking at the young man, a deep voice: &ldquo;so what are you for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a smile, the young man said, &ldquo;I was passing by here. Seeing how many cups of wine could be found here, I took a rest here and poured and drank from myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li turned his head and looked at Xiao Hui and said, &ldquo;if I said that I also brought this monkey here to look for wine, would you believe it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man was stunned and looked at Xiao Hui. He burst out laughing and stroked: &ldquo;believe, why don&rsquo;t you believe it! Come on, you and I have a drink. Life is lonely. It&rsquo;s rare that there is a person who is destined to find wine together in the remote corner of the earth. &quot;</p>
<p>After that, he raised his glass of wine to the devil, and then drank it down. GUI Li took a deep look at him, and slowly repeated that sentence: &ldquo;life is lonely, hey, life is lonely&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>All of a sudden, he also laughed. His smile was full of vicissitudes. He raised his glass and drank it. A hot smell of wine, from the throat down to the stomach, the wine in this remote town is quite powerful.</p>
<p>The young man said with a smile, &ldquo;how?&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li raised his eyes, reached out to take the wine pot, added wine for them, and said, &ldquo;good wine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man had a stronger smile. He patted the table and said with a laugh, &ldquo;good, it&rsquo;s really good wine.&rdquo; In the laughter, the young man&rsquo;s expression gradually became intense, and suddenly he said aloud:</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the old days, the vicissitudes have passed,</p>
<p>Remember, sad man.</p>
<p>White hair and withered lamp,</p>
<p>Once lonely, change the hangover&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>After chanting, his voice gradually turned to bleak, and his face was a bit lonely. Chant, he bowed his head speechless, ghost Li silently looked at him, drink the wine in the glass in front of him.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>At night, the cold wind gradually rises, the lonely town sounded the voice of &ldquo;Wuwu&rdquo;, such as someone quietly crying in the distance.</p>
<p>The night was deep and dark, and the earth was drowned. The monkey fell asleep on Taotie&rsquo;s body, and the fierce beast lay lazily on the ground at the moment. In the tavern, it was dark. The ghost and the boy sat in the dark. No one got up to look for the candle to light up.</p>
<p>Maybe they feel more comfortable in the dark.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, they just sit face to face, occasionally say a few unimportant words, occasionally drink a few glasses of wine, but more often they seem to remind each other of their thoughts, meditate silently, and think about the past of their lives.</p>
<p>In such a cold night, the ends of the earth remote place, two strangers seem to have known each other for a lifetime, indifferent to get along. (to be continued. )</p>
