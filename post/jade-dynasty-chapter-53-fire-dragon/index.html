      <p>Countless eyes in the dark are looking at the people in the three halos at the moment. Zhang Xiaofan somehow felt a little hairy in his heart. Looking at the jade and the stone, he found that their faces were not very good-looking either. I think they had never experienced such a scene before.</p>
<p>However, the countless creatures around them did not make any action to attack them. Apart from a few angry tigers and leopards roaring twice, there was basically no movement, just watching in silence.</p>
<p>They continued to descend slowly. After another four or five Zhangs, Zhang Xiaofan suddenly realized that the number of eyes of the creatures around him was gradually decreasing, but it seemed that the size of each eye was much larger than what he had just seen.</p>
<p>He frowned and approached the stone wall silently. Sure enough, with the light of the fire stick, he found that the number of holes in the dark stone wall was much smaller, but the size of each hole was more than twice the size of the upper one. Almost every hole was taller than one person. Correspondingly, the creatures in this cave are obviously fierce and ferocious, almost all of which are quite large, sharp teeth and fangs, with ferocious faces, which makes people feel cool.</p>
<p>Among them, Zhang Xiaofan was even more ferocious. He looked like a mountain pig, but there was a monster with a huge bear head. He roared, and the giant claws were waved out, almost hitting him.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was startled and hurriedly drove the magic weapon back for several feet. At this time, when Baguio and stone heard the sound, they all looked to him. Zhang Xiaofan said softly, &ldquo;it seems that all of them are fierce monsters. Let&rsquo;s be careful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both Baguio and Shitou nodded their heads and kept their heads on guard.</p>
<p>But apart from being near the stone wall and being attacked by the monsters, the three of them were not harassed. It seems that although these monsters are fierce, they don&rsquo;t have the ability to fly, so they can only stay in the cave. As Zhang Xiaofan carefully controlled his flight, he thought to himself: I don&rsquo;t know these monsters can&rsquo;t fly. They are on the cliff. But how did they hunt?</p>
<p>In this way, the three men fell several meters. At this time, from the cliff of Blackstone cave, they have at least reached the bottom of the earth nearly a hundred feet deep, but look down. This deep and huge black hole, except for the light from the eyes of those strange creatures around it, is still deep and invisible.</p>
<p>What is more different from the previous cognition is that under this abyss, not only did not feel cold. On the contrary, the temperature here is much higher than that on the surface of the black stone cave. At the moment, Zhang Xiaofan even feels that he is going to sweat. But looking around, it&rsquo;s still dark. There&rsquo;s no sign of Mars heat. It&rsquo;s very strange.</p>
<p>Stone drives his broken evil wand. When it slowly descends, he suddenly swears: &ldquo;Ge Laozi, this dead fox has found such a strange place to make a nest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan is nothing. But I heard the nearby Baguio &ldquo;Puchi&rdquo; and chuckled. The laughter was clear and sweet. Although she lowered her voice, it seemed to be far away in the quiet space.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan looked at her, only to see that in the white and soft halo of sad flowers, Biyao smiled like a flower, and her eyebrows were full of tenderness. At the moment, she seemed to feel something, and turned to look at Zhang Xiaofan. The two eyes meet, Zhang Xiaofan heart jump, hurriedly turned his head.</p>
<p>Further down, things seem to have changed a little. The hole in the stone wall is still growing larger, and the creatures inside are bigger than those in the stone hole on the top. It seems that they are bigger than ordinary people. But here, the three people accidentally found that nearly half of the caves were empty. In the fresh air all the time, there seems to be a faint smell of blood.</p>
<p>The three looked at each other. There is a color of vigilance in their eyes, but Rao does not slow down their decline.</p>
<p>In the boundless darkness under my feet, there seemed to be something, like starlight, like a flame, quietly lit up for a while.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>On the abyss, on Monday, Xian and his granddaughter Xiaohuan finally walked to the cliff where Zhang Xiaofan and others had just jumped under the torch. Looking at the precipice where there is no way to go, and the unfathomable abyss at the foot, the immortal was tongue tied and speechless on Monday.</p>
<p>Xiaohuan is not old after all. Although she has been wandering with her grandfather, she is still afraid in the dark and silent black stone cave. She put her head under the cliff and looked at it. She immediately shrank her head back and whispered to the fairy on Monday, &ldquo;Grandpa, do you have any way to go down?&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Monday, the fairy turned her eyes a few times and said: &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t know how to do it, and we didn&rsquo;t prepare the rope. This is bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan is relieved, clapping her heart with her hands and saying, &ldquo;OK, OK.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Monday, the immortal glared at her and said, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s so good? There may be a golden mountain, silver mountain, agate and emerald mountain waiting for us, but it&rsquo;s a big loss!&rdquo; I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>Xiaohuan snorted, picked up the ice sugar gourd in her right hand, took a bite, and said: &ldquo;return to Jinshan and Yinshan, I think it might be the corpse mountain and bone mountain waiting for you! Well, since we can&rsquo;t go down, let&rsquo;s go quickly. Otherwise, if you encounter one or two little demons, you, the 13th generation of the famous founder of Qingyun son, will lose his face again. &quot;</p>
<p>The immortal on Monday was furious: &ldquo;nonsense, how can I lose my master on Monday&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly, in the silent cave, on the way, there were two sounds of &ldquo;abetting&rdquo; from the dark, which flashed two lights, as fast as a flash of electricity, and suddenly fell in front of them.</p>
<p>On Monday, the fairy cried out in surprise, pulled the small ring, reached his right hand into his arms, grasped the yellow paper sign, and then he would cast a magic to escape. Unexpectedly, the light flickered for two times and two figures appeared. The movements of the visitors were even faster than ghosts. Before Zhou Yixian could take out the paper sign to cast the Dharma, he only heard the &ldquo;hissing&rdquo; sound. Monday Xianxian&rsquo;s neck was cold, but he had been framed by a thing near his neck. When he arrived, his cold hair stood up and he cried bitterly.</p>
<p>After a little calming, on Monday, the immortal realized that the other side had not taken his life, but the things around his neck had not been taken away. Strong courage to look at those two people, but see is a man and a woman two young people, the man&rsquo;s face is like a crown of jade, is extremely handsome, the woman&rsquo;s face is also like hibiscus, gorgeous.</p>
<p>At the moment, both of them are about a foot away from Monday fairy and Xiaohuan, but the man&rsquo;s waving place has a pure and warm magic weapon like a jade ruler around Monday fairy&rsquo;s neck. And the beautiful woman also controlled a green fairy sword and made a small ring. Poor Xiaohuan was pale with fright. Her right hand was still clutching the ice sugar gourd, and she cried loudly. &ldquo;Elder brother and elder sister, don&rsquo;t eat me. I have little meat and it&rsquo;s not delicious. You can eat my grandfather if you want. &quot;</p>
<p>On Monday, the fairy almost fell to the ground and said angrily, &ldquo;dead girl, I really raise you for nothing. I can&rsquo;t see it in ordinary days. When it comes to life and death, will I betray your grandfather?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan cried, &ldquo;Grandpa, don&rsquo;t blame me. After you die, at least I will give you a bunch of ice sugar gourd every now and then&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Monday, the immortal said angrily, &ldquo;nonsense, I hate this sweet and greasy thing most in my life. You should also send some beggar chicken, steamed fish and so on! &quot;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan nodded: &ldquo;Grandpa, I remember, you can go at ease.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Monday, Xian was relieved and said: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s almost the same, so I&rsquo;ll be more at ease Wait, wait! &quot; He woke up suddenly, and his eyebrows stood up. &ldquo;Dead girl, what do I want to do? Where can I go? No conscience. I&hellip;&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>Listen to Monday fairy then chattered a lot of words to scold Xiaohuan, and it seems that he can&rsquo;t finish it until tomorrow. The two men and women like the fairy frowned and looked at each other. At the same time, he took back the magic weapon.</p>
<p>Only listen to the woman: &ldquo;elder martial brother, I don&rsquo;t think they are evil, not like evil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not bad,&rdquo; the man said He turned to Monday fairy and shouted, &ldquo;who are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Monday, xianleng changed his calm expression and said: &ldquo;ha ha. I and my granddaughter know that there are evils running rampant here. They are here to subdue evils and do harm to the people. &quot;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan is mute beside him. She stares at Grandpa, but sees that the immortal is calm and looks as usual on Monday.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the man looked up and down at the two of them and said with a sneer, &ldquo;I see that your Taoist skills are superficial. I&rsquo;m afraid that even an ordinary little demon is not an opponent, and even dare to come to this dangerous place. I&rsquo;d better go back as early as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhou Yixian&rsquo;s face was red, and he said, &ldquo;yes, yes.&rdquo; Said pulled the small ring, turned around to walk outward.</p>
<p>After the old and the young disappeared into the darkness, the man turned to look at the cliff ahead and said, &ldquo;younger martial sister, it seems that we are going down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the pretty woman. This time, it&rsquo;s really God&rsquo;s help. Let&rsquo;s learn from that small town that the evil fox is hiding in this black stone cave. If we can get rid of the evils and recover the xuanhuojian, the valley master will be very happy. &quot;</p>
<p>The man smiled and said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not too late. Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, the light was shining. This man and woman, like lightning, went to the bottomless abyss under the precipice and threw themselves into it.</p>
<p>But on the cliff, in the dark, the fire flashed. On Monday, Xianxian and Xiaohuan stepped out slowly. They were not far away.</p>
<p>On Monday, the immortal frowned tightly and pondered for a moment. He said to Xiaohuan, &ldquo;these two young people have excellent aptitude and profound Taoism. Just now I saw a flame pattern rusted on the edge of their sleeves. I&rsquo;m afraid they are the disciples under the gate of burning incense valley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Small ring a surprised, way: &ldquo;burning incense Valley?&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Monday, the immortal nodded: &ldquo;incense Valley has a great influence. In the world of cultivation, it ranks with Qingyun gate and Tianyin temple in three major schools, and there are many high-ranking people under the gate. Recently, I heard that there are two outstanding disciples, one male and one female. The male is Li Xun and the female is huanyanhong. According to the magic weapons they just used, most of them are the two. &quot;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan glanced at the cliff and said, &ldquo;those three people who just went down&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Monday, Xian shrugged his shoulders, walked out with a small ring, and said, &ldquo;then we can&rsquo;t control it. Anyway, it&rsquo;s so busy tonight. We can&rsquo;t take advantage of it. Alas, it&rsquo;s a pity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan chuckles, but doesn&rsquo;t say a word. She goes out with Grandpa.</p>
<p>Only under the cliff is still dark. The figures of Li Xun and Yan Hong have disappeared.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan is in the dark. In addition to the increasingly hot temperature around him and the eyes of some monsters staring at him from time to time, he really feels like returning to the abyss of the dead.</p>
<p>The surrounding caves are becoming more and more huge. At the moment, most of the caves are about one and a half or even two people tall. The monsters inside are also becoming more and more fierce and bigger. However, there are more and more empty caves. And the smell of blood in the air seems to be more and more intense.</p>
<p>Even. In the course of his descent, he heard a slight chewing sound from an unknown place, like an unknown giant, tearing and swallowing food. It sounds creepy.</p>
<p>At the delicate moment when all of them were tight and could almost hear their heartbeat, suddenly, from the darkness below, Zhang Xiaofan suddenly felt a strong wind blowing under his feet.</p>
<p>Almost out of instinct. His heart moved with his will. At the moment when the wind touched his body, the fire stick quickly moved three feet to the side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pa!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A loud sound, reflecting the light, there seems to be a huge and incomparable thing like a tentacle in the dark deep place, like a whip, shaking past Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s side and hitting heavily on the dark stone wall.</p>
<p>The whole precipice seemed to vibrate, splashing with dust and falling large and small stones. A moment later. All of a sudden, the shrill cry came out of the abyss, and the stone walls were full of shrieks. Zhang Xiaofan and others were shocked. Looking back, they saw that the giant tentacle, like a devil, had rushed into a huge cave on the stone wall, stirred and twitched for several times, and then collected it.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan took a breath of cool air and felt that the wind was blowing on his face. A huge five eyed Saber Toothed strange tiger was caught by the huge tentacle. Dragged it out of the hole. Although the five eyed Saber Toothed strange tiger is roaring, its body is twice as big as that of ordinary people. Compared with this incredible giant tentacle, it is as small as a baby. incapable of action.</p>
<p>Once the tentacle catches the strange tiger, it immediately shrinks back to the dark place below. In a twinkling of an eye, it is not in the dark, leaving only the bleak and desperate roar of the strange tiger.</p>
<p>All three of them lived in the same shape and looked at each other, especially Biyao. His face was even paler.</p>
<p>At the foot of the dark, deep, really do not know how many terrible things, hidden in it.</p>
<p>After a while, the stone coughed and was trying to speak. Unexpectedly, Biyao&rsquo;s eyes were sharp, and she suddenly exclaimed, &ldquo;now, be careful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan and the stone were shocked again. He hurriedly looked down. He saw the fire flash in the darkness under his feet. In a moment, the heat in the surrounding space suddenly rose. He saw that the fire grew rapidly and came with the wind and heat. At a moment, the three people could see it real. They all changed their faces at once. They saw a fire dragon. They raised their heads and roared from the abyss , straight up.</p>
<p>Look at the appearance of the fire dragon. It&rsquo;s not much different from the fire dragon summoned by the three evil foxes with the xuanhuojian. But somehow, the size and power of the fire dragon at this moment is far better than the fire dragon just on the ground.</p>
<p>Although the three people have this question in their mind, it&rsquo;s not the time to think about it. Seeing the ferocity of the fire and the dragon, the heat waves filled the sky, they were unstoppable in the twinkling of an eye. The three people hurriedly separated and controlled the magic weapon to avoid its front.</p>
<p>The three color magic weapon, milliray, is a big shine to protect the master, but the dragon&rsquo;s power is too big. By contrast, it immediately presses down the magic circle.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan and other three people were almost pushed out by the huge fire wave at the same time. A moment later, &ldquo;bang bang bang&rdquo; hit the stone wall.</p>
<p>The fire dragon rushed to the sky, and the remaining momentum was amazing. Zhang Xiaofan bumped into the hard rock wall on his back, which was even more painful. However, he was lucky. After a little concentration, he saw that the huge body of the stone in the distance was impartial, and unexpectedly ran into a cave. Unfortunately, the roar of the beast soon came out of the cave.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was shocked and was about to rush to help, but he only heard the &ldquo;bang&rdquo; in the cave in the roar of the stone. At the end of the day, the golden light flashed back and a huge body was thrown out, but another strange looking monster. It seems that there is not much gas.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan put down his mind and thought that it was not unreasonable for him to call him stone. He was indeed harder than stone!</p>
<p>At this time, the fire dragon broke a circle above. In the howling sound, it rushed down like thunder.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan clenched his teeth and grasped the formula. He quickly moved away from the middle of the air to avoid the ferocious dragon head. He pointed to his right hand and fired the fire stick through the air, straight to the Dragon neck.</p>
<p>The dragon&rsquo;s eyes were moving with a sound of the fire dragon&rsquo;s voice. The huge left front dragon&rsquo;s claw was lifted, but it was against the green light of the fire stick. Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s face was white, and he felt the heat wave was burning and rolling in front of him. At present, we have to bite our teeth and support ourselves.</p>
<p>At this moment, I only heard the sound of chiding. On the abyss illuminated by the fire dragon, the water green figure flashed, and the green clothes of Biyao floated. Yingran floats down, sad flowers are bright and white, flying all over the sky, and the rain is bleak, covering the fire dragon&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roar&hellip;&rdquo; In the wildfire. Fire dragon is a dragon chant, right claw a grasp, when the sky is full of white rain flowers are it back three feet. But Zhang Xiaofan and Biyao work together, and their magic power is surging. They immediately lower the fire dragon a Zhang, just hitting the stone that just rushed out of the cave.</p>
<p>When the stone fixed his eyes, he saw that Zhang Xiaofan and Bi Yao were fighting against the huge fire dragon with all their strength. They were surrounded by fire. Although they had their own magic weapons, their faces were already red.</p>
<p>The stone opens its eyes round. Jump up, people in the middle of the air, but into a cross knee sitting posture, hands holding the broken evil wand, a moment of golden light, the whole mace shows golden light, almost transparent, obviously urged by the power of the law, and the stone itself is like a solemn, far away.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a Buddhist monk.</p>
<p>But when he suddenly opened his eyes, he was as powerful as the demon destroying King Kong. His body turned into a golden light in the middle of the sky. Across the air, in the roar, the whole staff of breaking evil method is inserted into the hard stone wall. In an instant, the original stone wall, which was as solid as iron, was even concave, reaching a range of four Zhang.</p>
<p>I saw the blue tendons on the rough face of the stone. It was almost horrible. Even the mouth seems to flow out light blood slowly, but the broken evil wand in the hand is golden and can&rsquo;t be forced to look. But listen to his roar, all the golden mansions suddenly contract, gather into a huge golden light, and shoot at the dragon head.</p>
<p>The power is not small. I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s the gathering of all the magic power of the stone. Rao is the ferocity of the fire dragon. With the first blow, Zhang Xiaofan and Biyao attack each other from the top. Under the heavy pressure, the fire dragon makes a long roar and shakes the four valleys, but it can&rsquo;t resist it after all. It falls down and quickly falls into the darkness at the foot.</p>
<p>A stone hit success, but the body is a flash, the face is more blood flash, a slip, but almost also followed the fall. Fortunately, Zhang Xiaofan, seeing that the stone&rsquo;s face was wrong, rushed to his side immediately, caught up with him and dragged him, which made the stone stand firm.</p>
<p>However, before the two of them could breathe, the top of the Biyao was a scream again. The green clothes fluttered and rushed down. Zhang Xiaofan glanced at the corner of his eyes and saw that the huge and unmatched tentacle just like a ghost rushed up again. This time, he hit them directly on the top of their heads.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was caught off guard by the wind. He was about to die under this huge touch. However, she was pale, but her body shape was like electricity. In a moment, her figure flashed and stopped Zhang Xiaofan. The sad flower in her hand suddenly turns into six strange flowers, which surround the middle one. Each flower has a pure white light connecting with it. It looks like a white light wheel. Zhang Xiaofan looks at it, and suddenly remembers that she used this technique when she resisted the black water snake under the dead spirit abyss.</p>
<p>But it is obvious that the unknown creature in the dark is just like the black water Xuan snake. It is extremely powerful. Although it can&rsquo;t be compared with the black water Xuan snake, the white light wheel of Biyao is not as lax as that day to the black water Xuan snake, but the whole person is shocked by his body shape, and he will be pressed into the boundless darkness immediately.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s mind was buzzing. He just felt the heat in front of him. He didn&rsquo;t know where the strength came from. He let go of the standing stone, and then he quickly caught up with the ferocious and twisted giant tentacles in the air and the hard-working Biyao.</p>
<p>Biyao is struggling with herself, but she just feels that the pressure is like a mountain and she is about to lose control. Suddenly, Zhang Xiaofan appears beside her. She is shocked and loses her voice and says, &ldquo;go quickly&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before I finished speaking, I saw Zhang Xiaofan attached to the fire stick. The green light flashed and rushed away, hitting the huge tentacles on top of the green Yao. The place where the tentacle was hit by the fire stick suddenly shrank. The skin, which was originally greasy, suddenly withered.</p>
<p>The tentacles seemed to be hurt, and they were immediately put away. When Biyao&rsquo;s pressure was relieved, Zhang Xiaofan came to the rescue despite his life and death. His heart was full of joy and worry, but before she could speak, his face turned white.</p>
<p>In the dark place, the huge tentacle reappeared, but this time it was silent. Zhang Xiaofan rushed to Zhang Xiaofan directly from his feet. Zhang Xiaofan was caught by the tentacle when he was in a pain. Then he was dragged down by the tentacle and fell into the darkness.</p>
<p>At the same time, Bi Yao and the stone arrived at the moment lose their color, let alone catch up with each other. (to be continued. )</p>
