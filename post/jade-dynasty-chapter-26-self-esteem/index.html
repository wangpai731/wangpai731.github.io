      <p>&ldquo;Xiaofan, didn&rsquo;t you say you wanted to find Xiaohui and that rhubarb dog? How did you bring me to the kitchen?&rdquo; Zeng Shushu follows Zhang Xiaofan and goes into the kitchen to nag.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan looked into the kitchen carefully, only to find that it was much more spacious and bright than dazhufeng&rsquo;s kitchen. He looked at it carefully and said, &ldquo;although I haven&rsquo;t seen them in the morning, I guess it&rsquo;s mostly here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu shrugged his shoulders and said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s impossible. What do you think of the three eyed monkey? It&rsquo;s a natural thing. Compared with people, it&rsquo;s better. How can you think of it as a thief? It&rsquo;s a greedy thief&hellip; Ah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the gaping expression of Zeng Shu&rsquo;s bibliography, Zhang Xiaofan picked up the ash from the back of a jar in the corner of the kitchen. The ash was carried in the air by him, squeaking and screaming. Then he ran out of the jar and barked at them.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan has a look at Zeng Shushu. Zeng Shushu&rsquo;s face is full of tears and smiles.</p>
<p>Holding Xiaohui in his arms, Zhang Xiaofan scolded rhubarb and said, &ldquo;dead dog, stop barking, want someone to catch us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rhubarb seems to understand what he said. After reading the ash in his arms, the dog&rsquo;s mouth &ldquo;whine&rdquo; a few times, and then there is no sound. Zhang Xiaofan took a look around him and saw that most of the things were still intact. It seems that these two thieves haven&rsquo;t got their hands yet. He was very lucky. He hurriedly walked out with little ash in his arms and walked for two steps. He found that rhubarb didn&rsquo;t catch up with him. Looking back, he saw that rhubarb ran to the pot just now with his tail clamped and drum twice. Then he ran over with a piece of meat bone from the eldest brother.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan stares at the little ash in his arms. The little ash cracks the monkey&rsquo;s mouth and laughs foolishly. Zeng Shushu looked in his eyes and shook his head.</p>
<p>They sneaked out of the kitchen with monkey dogs for fear of being found out. They could not wash their dirty names any more. They finally ran to the distance. They were relieved.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan gasped for a while and said, &ldquo;by the way, I didn&rsquo;t congratulate you just now. I won another game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu didn&rsquo;t care. His eyes only looked carefully at the little ash in Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s arms and said, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter? Anyway, he will be defeated by others sooner or later&hellip; Why is the little ash so dirty? You haven&rsquo;t bathed him in a few days?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan froze for a moment and said, &ldquo;never washed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu seemed to faint. He hit his forehead with his hand and said, &ldquo;you, you, how can you treat it like this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was not convinced. He thought that the monkey would climb up and down all day, where would it be washed clean. But seeing Zeng Shushu&rsquo;s sad face, he knew that he was unreasonable on this issue. With a dry smile, he turned off the topic and said, &ldquo;by the way, do you know that in the third round of competition tomorrow, Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s opponent is my elder martial sister Tian ling&rsquo;er.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu was shocked and said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s your elder martial sister. Is it Tian ling&rsquo;er who uses amber and Zhu Ling?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Zhang Xiaofan reached out to the little grey head that was climbing on his shoulder and touched it, saying, &ldquo;Lu Xueqi was very popular these two days. I was worried about my elder martial sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu nodded his head and said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the same thing. If you don&rsquo;t say anything else, you can&rsquo;t stand the&rdquo; Tianya &ldquo;in Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was a little worried and said, &ldquo;Shushu, do you think my elder martial sister will be in danger? Lu Xueqi destroyed his opponent&rsquo;s Xianjian in the first competition and heard that elder martial brother of changmen was seriously hurt in the second competition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu glared at him and said: &ldquo;you are very thoughtful. I see that your elder martial sister&rsquo;s Taoist practice is much higher than you. You should worry about yourself. It&rsquo;s more and more powerful when you go down. According to yourself, you haven&rsquo;t cultivated the third level of taijixuanqingdaoyuqingjing, and you won&rsquo;t kill people with a sword! &hellip; give me the ash. &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan hesitated for a moment and handed over Xiaohui, who had been happily holding it in his arms, but Xiaohui was greatly dissatisfied, squeaking and screaming.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan sighed and said, &ldquo;you are right, elder martial sister has a profound Taoism and beautiful people. There are so many people like her. Where can I care about her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu hugged the ash tightly and stared at it. He was afraid that he would suffer losses if he saw it less. He said casually: &ldquo;you know, it&rsquo;s better to think about how to protect your life tomorrow. I told you that tomorrow&rsquo;s opponent, my elder martial brother Peng Chang, who is returning to the peak of the wind, is definitely not comparable to Chu Yuhong today, especially the magic weapon &ldquo;Wu hook&rdquo; he cultivated, which is made of fire copper for thousands of years. It&rsquo;s very powerful. &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan, with a sad face, said, &ldquo;you are all covered with magic weapons. What can I do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shuyan doesn&rsquo;t lift his eyes, or he looks at Xiaohui, steps forward and says, &ldquo;Xiaohui, come back with me and I&rsquo;ll give you two bunches of bananas, OK? Er, Xiao Fan, what did you just say? &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan walked side by side with him and sighed, &ldquo;I envy you that you can use magic weapons. What&rsquo;s that feeling?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu shrugged his shoulders and said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s not the case. It&rsquo;s a long time to cultivate Xianjian. It&rsquo;s natural that the magic weapon will have some reaction with you. On the basis of this, it&rsquo;s up to you to drive the magic weapon with the mental power and spiritual power. Go to heaven and earth and split the sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was stunned for a while and said, &ldquo;induction, is it a cool feeling?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu put his eyes on Xiaohui and replied casually, &ldquo;not necessarily, look at the material of the magic weapon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan thought about it, after all, he shook his head and gave up the delusion in his mind. He said, &ldquo;book, you say it&rsquo;s like a god like Tianya. How did you build it at the beginning? Must it be a spectacular scene?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu looked at Zhang Xiaofan strangely and said, &ldquo;how do I know? It&rsquo;s also the first time I&rsquo;ve seen this legendary artifact. &quot; He said and looked down at Xiaohui. Regardless of Xiaohui&rsquo;s angry face, he felt Xiaohui&rsquo;s hair with a smile on his face. He said, &ldquo;but in terms of induction, I&rsquo;ve seen it in ancient books before. The magic weapon that really communicates with the true man&rsquo;s mind is not these so-called miraculous things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; said Zhang Xiaofan</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu said: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s some magic weapons refined by the master&rsquo;s own blood. It&rsquo;s made with blood as the medium. The magic weapons often carry the evil spirit, but they are connected with the master&rsquo;s flesh and blood. Although it&rsquo;s said in the book that these are all evil ways, most of them are vicious and evil things, and the right way doesn&rsquo;t do it, but these magic weapons can only be used by those who have the master&rsquo;s blood spirit. Unlike the methods we practice now Treasure, fell into the hands of the senior of Taoism and was subdued&hellip; Eh! &quot;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu stops and finds that there is no one around him. When he looks back, he sees Zhang Xiaofan stop and stand behind him and stare at him. His face is very strange.</p>
<p>Zeng Shuxin was surprised and said, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter, Xiao Fan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s body shakes, barely smiles, and says, &ldquo;nothing, nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu looked at him a little more and thought that he was worried about tomorrow&rsquo;s competition. He walked over with a smile and patted him on the shoulder and said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t worry. I&rsquo;ve already told elder martial brother Peng that tomorrow&rsquo;s competition will not be heavy on you. It will also make you lose more decently, so that you can meet your master&rsquo;s mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan seemed to be absent-minded, but he nodded and said, &ldquo;Oh, thank you very much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went forward a few steps. Zeng Shushu was busy looking at the ash in his arms, but Zhang Xiaofan seemed to be full of thoughts and silent. After a while, Xiaohui seemed to be unable to bear Zeng Shushu&rsquo;s non-human eyes any longer. He shouted angrily and stretched out his claws to catch Zeng Shushu. Seeing that Xiaohui had been honest since the beginning, Zeng Shushu relaxed his vigilance for a while and was attacked by it unexpectedly. This time, he could not hide. There were several scars on his white and clean face, which made him release his hand.</p>
<p>Xiaohui was free and happy, but he didn&rsquo;t go back to Zhang Xiaofan. Instead, he rushed to the ground and ran forward quickly. He ran to the two people who were walking in front of him in three steps and two steps, &ldquo;whoosh&rdquo; to one person.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was stunned for a moment. Looking up, she saw that the woman was smiling like a flower. She was standing in the white clouds. Her clothes were light and moving. Her waist was red and beautiful. It was Tian linger. He was about to open his mouth. Suddenly, his whole body was warm and cold, and cold came into his heart. Beside Tian ling&rsquo;er, there was a handsome man standing beside the jade tree. Who was Qi Hao?</p>
<p>At this time, Tian ling&rsquo;er is also shocked. In normal times, Xiao Hui only pesters Zhang Xiaofan. Unexpectedly, today, she suddenly changes her temper and becomes intimate with herself, which is unexpected. In fact, in her heart, she also quite likes this clever monkey. Now she stroked and touched the ash. She smiled at this place and said, &ldquo;Xiaofan, how can you be here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan said in a low voice, expressionless, &ldquo;my friends and I are here for a walk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Qi Hao, standing beside Tian ling&rsquo;er, glanced at Zeng Shushu, smiled at the corner of his mouth, and arched his hand: &ldquo;brother Zeng, we have met again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu did not dare to neglect. He replied, &ldquo;Hello, elder martial brother Qi.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian ling&rsquo;er looked at them and said, &ldquo;do you know each other?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Qi Hao said with a smile, &ldquo;younger martial brother Zeng is the beloved son of martial uncle Zeng Fenghui. He has a profound family history and a profound way of doing things. This time, seven pulse martial arts is our enemy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu smiled and said: &ldquo;elder martial brother Qi, you are famous for Qingyun. The young disciples of Qingyun sect naturally respect you. How dare I be presumptuous!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Qihao laughed and said, &ldquo;brother Zeng is flattered. I dare not to be a teacher.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian ling&rsquo;er saw Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s expression was a little different. He came over and said, &ldquo;Xiaofan, what&rsquo;s the matter with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan shook his head and said, &ldquo;elder martial sister, you must compete with Lu Xueqi of xiaozhufeng tomorrow. Be careful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian ling&rsquo;er smiled and turned to look at Qi Hao. Qi Hao smiled and said nothing. Tian ling&rsquo;er replied with a smile. Then he turned to Zhang Xiaofan and said, &ldquo;I know in my heart that this is not the case. Elder martial brother Qi has a high level of Taoism and is warm-hearted. Because he has some affinity with me, he asked me to point out some key points for tomorrow&rsquo;s competition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan bowed his head, and for a long time, said astringently, &ldquo;elder martial sister, I&rsquo;m going to have a competition with elder martial brother Peng, who is Feng Huifeng. I can&rsquo;t applaud you. Be careful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian ling&rsquo;er didn&rsquo;t care. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s OK. Xiao Fan, her father and mother said they would go to see my competition. Besides,&rdquo; she gave Qi Hao a look in her heart and said, &ldquo;elder martial brother Qi will also go to see me. With his advanced cultivation, I will not fail at his instruction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t guarantee that,&rdquo; Qi Hao said with a smile in the distance</p>
<p>Tian ling&rsquo;er looks back and stares at him. Then he can&rsquo;t help laughing. The white jade like skin is more like frost than snow. It&rsquo;s a little pink and bright, almost blinding.</p>
<p>Only Zeng Shushu stood aside, but clearly saw that Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s eyes and face were rapidly darkened, almost no anger, and could not help frowning.</p>
<p>　　※※※</p>
<p>The night is deep and the cold moon is high in the sky.</p>
<p>Above the sea of clouds, there is no voice. A lonely shadow, wandering in the cold moonlight, walking aimlessly and aimlessly in the light cloud and air.</p>
<p>Unconsciously, he stepped on the Hongqiao bridge and came to the edge of the green water pool. The water is as smooth as a mirror, the waves are calm, reflecting the stars all over the sky, all falling into the water.</p>
<p>Beautiful scenery on a good day.</p>
<p>But the man didn&rsquo;t seem to pay any attention to these things. He just stood by the water and looked at the water, as if he remembered something. For a long time, his body suddenly shook, his hands tightly held, and he looked very painful.</p>
<p>Then he turned his head slowly, looked at the dark grove beside the Hongqiao, and walked slowly.</p>
<p>The moonlight shines on Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s face, which is a bit sad.</p>
<p>Should we always stand in this dark corner, quietly watching others&rsquo; happiness and tasting our own pain!</p>
<p>In the distance, there was a faint sound of footsteps.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s dark. It&rsquo;s dormant in this grove.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so late. What&rsquo;s the reason why the headmaster and senior brother asked us to come?&rdquo; With the sound, six figures appeared. Zhang Xiaofan hid in the dark and was surprised. It was the first six vessels in Qingyun Mountain except Tongtian peak, and Tian was not easy to be in it. What he was talking about was the first Shang Zhengliang in Chaoyang peak.</p>
<p>Cangsong said: &ldquo;I heard that elder martial brother of the headmaster has tried to use psychics with the holy master today. I&rsquo;m afraid that some of them have been found, so we need to discuss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lingzun&rdquo; water unicorn is a mountain spirit beast of Qingyun gate. It has a great relationship with each other. Everyone stops talking and looks dignified. After a while, they go far away.</p>
<p>After a long time, Zhang Xiaofan dared to walk out of the woods and looked at the green water pool subconsciously. The water was as calm as usual. It seemed that lingzun had been sleeping in the water for a long time.</p>
<p>He looked up at the cold moon in the sky, just wanted to go back, but he reached out and took out the black burning stick from his arms. During the day, Zeng Shushu&rsquo;s words shocked him a lot and made him wonder. But at the moment, he had no other thoughts in his mind, just like elder martial sister ling&rsquo;er and Qi Hao standing together.</p>
<p>His heart has been stabbed like a needle, but now, it has become numb and empty, as if three souls and seven spirits are gone.</p>
<p>Slowly pick up the fire stick. Under the dark blue surface, a small red blood line can be seen clearly. It&rsquo;s like a blood thread, which is distributed all over the stick, even in the bead on the top.</p>
<p>Is this my blood?</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan thought lightly in his heart. At the moment when he heard zengshu&rsquo;s words, he almost immediately felt the urge to throw away the burning stick. However, Qi Hao and Tian linger, who came with them, gave him a greater impact in his heart, and he didn&rsquo;t care about the so-called evil things at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hum!&rdquo; &ldquo;Even if it&rsquo;s evil things, it&rsquo;s also a magic weapon with great power. How can I have such a good life? Isn&rsquo;t it an ugly fire stick that I&rsquo;m with?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cold feeling, slowly from the fire stick up, wandering in his body, as if to comfort him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Magic weapon? Magic weapon? &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan clenched his teeth. &ldquo;What am I, how can I use magic weapons?&rdquo; After speaking, his voice was choked. Even the cold breath seemed to be stirred by his sadness. The feeling of jumping seemed to be active.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan felt it, but he didn&rsquo;t pay attention to it. He thought it was the mountain wind that made him cold. He slowly raised his head and looked at the fire stick in his hand. In his mind, he had gone to the valley with Tian ling&rsquo;er. For a while, it seemed like another life.</p>
<p>The bloodshot in the dark blue of the fire staff lights up slowly, as if it is sensing something. Zhang Xiaofan accidentally saw it, and he was shocked by it. At the same time, he thought of the words of Zeng Shushu in the daytime. In his heart, an uncontrollable impulse burst up.</p>
<p>Shut your eyes.</p>
<p>In an instant, the cold feeling went all over the body without any chill. Four times, it was silent, but deep in my heart, I heard a roar so clearly. It was like the scream of countless enemies under Jiuyou, with endless resentment, rising.</p>
<p>White bone, blood, shriek, blood!</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan opened his eyes and gasped for breath. However, just a moment later, he held his breath.</p>
<p>His hands are spread flat, his fingers are stretched or bent, and he holds them in the form of a formula. The black fire stick is now flying away from his hands, standing in the air, with black air rising and blue light.</p>
<p>In front of the fire stick, the front of the grove is facing one of his originally prosperous trees. In this moment, it has completely withered, and the branches and leaves are scattered. It seems that something absorbs all life in an instant.</p>
<p>For the first time in his life, Zhang Xiaofan felt that he was so close to the fire stick. Although the stick was in the middle of the air, he could clearly feel that he was holding it. The familiar cold air was stronger than ever before. There seemed to be some inexplicable fresh breath in it. He took it from the black stick and walked all over the body.</p>
<p>At this time, Zhang Xiaofan suddenly heard a low roar in the distance behind him. He turned his head in horror, only to see that the waves in the clear water pool were suddenly in disorder, as if something had been startled. He didn&rsquo;t think much about it any more. He ran subconsciously and ran quickly to the top of Hongqiao. He didn&rsquo;t turn his head back. He ran forward until he passed Hongqiao and came to the sea of clouds. He couldn&rsquo;t feel anything different behind him, so he stopped and gasped for breath.</p>
<p>For a long time, he gazed at the black fire stick in his hand again. At the moment, the fire stick was as usual, flat, ugly and quiet lying in his hand.</p>
<p>　　※※※</p>
<p>The next day, the seven channels of Qingyun gate entered the third round of martial arts.</p>
<p>Sixteen Qingyun disciples are distributed on the eight challenge arenas and compete at the same time. Among the three people in dazhufeng, Zhang Xiaofan was arranged to compete on the &ldquo;kan&rdquo; stage, song Daren on the &ldquo;Li&rdquo; stage, and Tian linger and Lu Xueqi on the &ldquo;Qian&rdquo; stage.</p>
<p>According to Zeng Shushu, Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s friend who has known each other for only three days but has been very familiar with each other, there are many problems in the arrangement of the challenge arena. In fact, it&rsquo;s no wonder that Lu Xueqi and Tian linger are so popular in the contest. Lu Xueqi, who is pregnant with &ldquo;Tianya&rdquo;, doesn&rsquo;t need to say. In recent days, all the young disciples of Qingyun gate who come out for the contest must be surrounded by three layers The outer three floors are full of water. And Tian ling&rsquo;er, Dazhu peak, has a reputation for early wisdom in Qingyun gate. These two days, she has made a great show of her skills. She has even conquered the powerful enemies and attracted the public&rsquo;s attention. Besides, she looks as beautiful as Lu Xueqi. For a while, she was very bright with Lu Xueqi. The good people have many comments in private.</p>
<p>Today, the two most outstanding young female disciples of Qingyun sect in the past hundred years met prematurely. The elders may feel sorry, but the young disciples are all happy and exultant. They have surrounded the qiantai as an iron barrel.</p>
<p>Song Daren and Zhang Xiaofan stand in front of Tian not easy and say goodbye to him. Tian not easy looks at Song Daren and says, &ldquo;your opponent today is Chang men&rsquo;s regular arrow. He is patient and has been cultivating for many years. His defense is very strong. It&rsquo;s just the opposite of the&rdquo; ten tigers &ldquo;you cultivate. You should be careful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren said respectfully, &ldquo;yes, master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan felt that the name seemed familiar to him. After thinking for a while, he recalled that when he first went up the mountain five years ago, Chang Jian led him and Lin Jingyu to Yuqing hall.</p>
<p>When he thought about it, he felt a little worried about Lin Jingyu. He heard that his friend won the second match yesterday. He was very powerful and regarded as a genius by all. He just had no time to go and congratulate him.</p>
<p>Tian could not easily turn his eyes to see Zhang Xiaofan standing next to song Daren. The unexpected little apprentice stood there with his head bowed and said nothing. Tian didn&rsquo;t easily frown and said, &ldquo;seven, you should be careful. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if you don&rsquo;t give up. Don&rsquo;t hurt yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s body shook, but others could not see what he felt inside, only whispered: &ldquo;yes, master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren looked at the distance and said, &ldquo;master, it&rsquo;s not early. I&rsquo;m going with my younger martial brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian not easy nodded, standing on one side of Su Ru smile: &ldquo;all careful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren responded and walked out of the circle with Zhang Xiaofan. Along the way, he felt that today&rsquo;s younger martial brother seemed to have something wrong with him. He said to Zhang Xiaofan, &ldquo;younger martial brother, are you nervous that you don&rsquo;t say a word today?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan glanced at the elder martial brother and forced a smile, but didn&rsquo;t answer.</p>
<p>Song Daren smiled happily and said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t think so much about it. Don&rsquo;t think too much about the outcome. Although Shifu and Shiniang love face, they will never blame you. Do you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Zhang Xiaofan answered, but he said to himself: they have no expectation of me, so they will not blame me.</p>
<p>Song Daren nodded, and then they walked out of the crowd. It was not easy to squeeze in, but it was quite easy to go out. Song Daren smiled and said, &ldquo;little martial brother, we are going to leave separately. Good luck. I hope you can win another game later.&rdquo; After that, he did not wait for Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s reaction, but he laughed.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan sighed a little and went to the challenge arena where he competed.</p>
<p>Under the stage of Kan, most of the disciples of fenghuifeng were here. Zhang Xiaofan also saw a group of senior brother Gao. Fenghui peak is a branch of Qingyun gate, with more than 200 disciples, second only to Tongtian peak and Longshou peak of changmen. It&rsquo;s obvious that people in fenghuifeng heard something from Zeng Shushu. They all looked relaxed and saw Zhang Xiaofan even nodded with a friendly smile.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why, Zhang Xiaofan suddenly felt that everyone&rsquo;s kind smile in front of him was so annoying, which was a kind of contempt for himself.</p>
<p>He walked up to the challenge arena without expression. Behind him, everyone stood on his opposite side. This time, even Zeng Shushu was gone, because he had to compete himself.</p>
<p>But even if he comes, he should also cheer for the elder martial brother of the same vein!</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s heart suddenly gushed out a burst of unspeakable loneliness. Standing on the high challenge arena, he watched countless eyes under the arena, but he didn&rsquo;t even have a friend.</p>
<p>For what, for what, always have to face everyone, even a friend can not see!</p>
<p>Sixteen year old boy, in the heart silently shouting, stubbornly biting his lips, lowered his head.</p>
<p>The mountain wind came slowly and brushed the side of my face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sound of bells and tripods near and far away rang almost at the same time, reverberating at the top of Tongtian peak, which had to be spread far away. Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s first thought was: elder martial sister ling&rsquo;er should also start to compete. She should not be hurt.</p>
<p>Then he felt sad and said to himself, &ldquo;she won&rsquo;t be hurt. You can take charge of any rotation. Let alone Shifu and his mother are there. Even Qi Hao said that he would go immediately after he solved his opponent as soon as possible. Haha, as soon as possible to solve the opponent, good prestige, good self-confidence ah, really treat the opponent as nothing&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>He thought so in his mind, forgetting that he was also on the challenge arena, until the opponent standing opposite him called out the third time: &ldquo;elder martial brother Zhang!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan suddenly woke up, looked up, but saw a elder martial brother standing opposite me who did not know when the wind returned to the peak. He was tall and had a gentle look. But when he saw Zhang Xiaofan in a daze, he could not help but look strange.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s face was red, only to hear a burst of laughter under the stage.</p>
<p>Peng Chang said with a smile: &ldquo;in the downwind back to the peak disciple Peng Chang, please give me some advice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan hurriedly replied, &ldquo;Zhang Xiaofan, a disciple of dazhufeng sect, has seen elder martial brother Peng.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After seeing the ceremony, Peng Chang smiled and looked at Zhang Xiaofan up and down. Then he lowered his voice and said: &ldquo;brother Zhang, brother Zeng has already told me about you. I&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s body shakes. Suddenly, he blurts out uncontrollably: &ldquo;elder martial brother Peng, please let go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peng Chang was stunned and looked at Zhang Xiaofan carefully. For a while, he put away his smile, nodded his head, and crossed his right hand in front of him. With the sound of &ldquo;Zheng&rdquo;, a handle radiated red light, almost like a fairy sword surrounded by the burning fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This sword &lsquo;Wu hook&rsquo; is made of thousands of years of fire copper. Please teach me.&rdquo; For some reason, Peng Chang looked serious and dignified, but he seemed to talk to an even enemy.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan felt the fiery air coming from afar, which was quite different from the warm and upright air of the famous Shaoyang immortal sword of Chu in Chaoyang peak yesterday, and a little bit more domineering.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s heart beat faster involuntarily, even when he thought of the result to be faced later, he was so nervous that his body trembled slightly. However, he clenched his teeth, tried his best to control himself, and took out the black burning stick from his arms.</p>
<p>Under the stage, there was a sharp laugh.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan, like being pricked, shivered.</p>
<p>Peng Chang, who was standing opposite him, did not smile. He took a look at the black fire stick and said in the right color, &ldquo;younger martial brother Zhang, please!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan looks at this opponent. Behind the burning fire, PENGCHANG is like the ancient god of fire. The whole person is different. The blazing fire makes the smoke in the air rise, and even his face looks fuzzy.</p>
<p>Holding the black stick tightly, Zhang Xiaofan felt the feeling of flesh and blood again, as if he knew the master&rsquo;s mood, and the cold feeling was boiling again.</p>
<p>The black and unsightly fire stick rises slowly from the air, leaves his palm, and emits a dark blue light. Although it is unsightly and weak, it stands in the middle of the air, facing the overwhelming and omnipotent strong flame in front of it. Neither it nor its master has the slightest intention of flinching.</p>
<p>A person, a firebrand, facing the whole world!</p>
<p>Under the stage, laughter slowly flattened down, people don&rsquo;t know why, hold their breath.</p>
<p>The huge fire is becoming more and more prosperous. It&rsquo;s hard to know what it&rsquo;s burning. The disciples of fenghuifeng, who are far away from the stage, feel so hot that they even retreat. Some of the disciples who have made friends with Zeng Shushu and know their internal affairs, such as senior brother Gao, have turned pale. Everyone can see where Peng Chang is now. He&rsquo;s totally a pair of mercies It&rsquo;s like fighting for life and death.</p>
<p>The fire dragon is getting bigger and bigger. It almost covers the arena. Seen from a distance, Zhang Xiaofan standing on the stage, his clothes and pants, even the ends of his hair and eyebrows, seemed to have scorched. It&rsquo;s creepy to imagine that he is in the melting pot at the moment.</p>
<p>However, the young man stood there, with pain on his face but without flinching, with fear in his eyes but fanaticism in his heart. The fire seemed to burn in his eyes.</p>
<p>With a roar, a huge fire dragon came and devoured all the world.</p>
<p>As if a moment, but solidified a lifetime.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan looks up to the sky and roars. The fire staff is so green that it rushes into the fire.</p>
<p>The roar was deafening in the burning flames.</p>
<p>Under the stage, senior brother Gao and others looked at each other. After a while, they fell down and sighed, &ldquo;how could it be like this!&rdquo;</p>
