<p>Bai Xiaochun tried the degree of protection, immediately laughed, and then looked at his own wooden sword, which he had when he was a beginner. Now, he has experienced two times of soul refining. [love to go to the small</p>
<p>&ldquo;Judging from the protection degree of this jade pendant, the power of this wooden sword must be extraordinary after I refine it for the third time!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun smiles and begins to refine the small wooden sword.</p>
<p>With the silver light shining, when the light in the turtle shaped pot dissipated, the small wooden sword appeared in front of Bai Xiaochun. The third silver grain on the wooden sword was dazzling. It took a long time for it to fade. At the same time, the appearance of the wooden sword also changed. It was a finger longer than before, and the vein of the wood grain was almost completely purple.</p>
<p>There are even bursts of strange aroma, but the aroma is very strange, the taste inside the mouth and nose, the beginning is sweet, but it will soon make people trance.</p>
<p>When Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s body shook, his eyes regained consciousness. He looked at the small wooden sword in surprise, picked it up slowly, and immediately found that the weight of the small wooden sword was several times more than before, and it was like a heavy rock in his hand.</p>
<p>His eyes flashed, and he put the wooden sword in front of him and looked at it carefully. His eyes gradually showed deep thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The material of this wooden sword should not be a rare kind of ChenYun wood. This kind of wood can be used as a material for refining utensils in only seven to forty-nine days of refining, and can be made in large quantities.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun murmured and glanced over the texture of the wooden sword.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Purple lines, then there is only one explanation. After many times of soul refining, there are signs of variation.&rdquo; When Bai Xiaochun closed his eyes, he immediately came up with all the information about chenyunmu in his knowledge of vegetation.</p>
<p>For a long time, when he opened his eyes, there was expectation in his eyes. He pinched a small wooden sword with his right hand. Suddenly, the sword flashed black light, and the purple light flickered in it. In a flash, he flew out of the house in a blink of an eye, and even leaped out of the yard. More than ten Zhang away, he directly stabbed into a huge rock. [love to go to the small</p>
<p>Quietly, the small wooden sword penetrated into the stone, and then penetrated out. In a blink of an eye, it returned to Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>The body of the sword is not damaged in the slightest, but there are bursts of sharp breath, looming.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun was excited, and carefully played with the wooden sword. After covering up the third Silver Stripe again, he opened the door of the wooden house. He took a deep breath and was preparing to be energetic. But when he thought of xiangyunshan Xiaobi more than two months later, he felt that it was still not safe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s enough. Those people must be very fierce. I have to prepare more.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun gritted his teeth and thought of the two realms introduced in Ziqi Yuding Gong.</p>
<p>Lift as light as you lift.</p>
<p>These two realms are the methods of enlightenment when practicing the skill of controlling tripod with Ziqi. If you can practice to the extreme, you can develop a kind of magic power called Ziqi Huading Ding.</p>
<p>Nowadays, in the South Bank of Lingxi, controlling the tripod with Ziqi is the basic skill. Almost everyone has practiced it. However, not many people can practice it. In the second realm, it is even more rare to lift the tripod with light weight. As for the perfection of cultivation, there are even fewer miracles of Ziqi melting tripod.</p>
<p>Even if there is a clear understanding of the purple gas tripod, most of them are disciples of the purple tripod peak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lift heavy as light Only when I reach this state of controlling things can my grasp be greatly improved. &quot; Bai Xiaochun thought about the introduction of the skill and looked down at the small wooden sword in his hand.</p>
<p>In the war between Xu Baocai and him, he was mistakenly thought by the supervisors&rsquo; room and the huozao room that he had realized that he could lift a heavy weight lightly. In retrospect, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s mind flashed away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The reason why I was thought to realize that lifting heavy weights like light is that I controlled the blade of the small wooden sword, but most of the reason was that the power of the small wooden sword was so powerful after it was refined.</p>
<p>In fact, I am not proficient in the manipulation of wooden swords, let alone lift weights lightly&hellip; &quot; Bai Xiaochun frowned and sat cross legged in the courtyard. She looked down at the wooden sword. Her eyes were slowly numb, but blood gradually appeared.</p>
<p>A moment later, his right hand suddenly lifted up, and the small wooden sword flew out. He slashed hard in front of him. The wind howled, blowing up a lot of dust on the ground. Bai Xiaochun frowned more tightly. He pointed again with his right hand. This time, he didn&rsquo;t mean the wooden sword, but the big stone just penetrated by the wooden sword outside the courtyard.</p>
<p>Under a finger, the big stone suddenly vibrates, slowly rises a foot, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s aura is not stable, a bang, the big stone fell down again.</p>
<p>But Bai Xiaochun not only did not feel depressed, but his eyes became more and more bright. With persistence, he moved the aura in his body and pointed again.</p>
<p>Once, twice, three times</p>
<p>As time went by, half a month passed. In the past half a month, Bai Xiaochun tried to control the big stone almost every moment. The stone was more than three people high and weighed no less than seven or eight hundred jin. Even if Bai Xiaochun reached the fifth layer of condensate gas, it was not easy to control it thoroughly.</p>
<p>This is still because his internal cultivation is refined, so he can try it. If he changes the other five layers of condensate, it will only lift the big stone by several inches at most.</p>
<p>At present, after a month of unremitting efforts, Bai Xiaochun has long found that the biggest difficulty in controlling the stone is not the lack of aura, but the instability in the control. He often has aura in his body, but he interrupts himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The key to controlling things is to keep the silk thread flowing at a steady speed.&rdquo; White small pure eyes in a flash of light, eyes bloodshot diffuse, hoarse murmur.</p>
<p>This is just like the noodles made by ordinary people. If the speed of pulling is too fast, the noodles will be broken. If it is too slow, it can not be pulled out too long. Only by grasping an inch of strength can we be able to do what we want.</p>
<p>If a monk wants to control things to an extraordinary level, he needs to keep it steady. In this way, the difficulty will naturally increase.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve learned that lifting heavy things like light doesn&rsquo;t mean literally. Controlling heavy things has a light and spiritual feeling. It&rsquo;s just a representation. The real meaning is not the manipulation of things, but the manipulation of aura.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The total amount of Reiki in the five layers of condensate gas is the word&rdquo; heavy &ldquo;, and turning it into a thin but continuous silk thread is the word&rdquo; light &ldquo;. If it can be done, it is like lifting heavy as light, and the external performance is the speed after being able to handle it well!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun looked excited. After he figured out the problem, he raised his right hand, and immediately the big stone in the distance vibrated and was lifted suddenly.</p>
<p>It was as if an invisible hand grasped the big stone. With a cry after it was lifted off, he went straight to Bai Xiaochun. But in the middle of the air, he stopped and hit the yard, raising dust.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun did not feel discouraged, and continued to try, until half a month later, he found that in any case, he could not seem to be able to make his aura always keep a steady silk thread.</p>
<p>Sometimes, even if it is really done, but because the stone is too heavy, the aura silk thread is still unstable and disconnected in the flow.</p>
<p>However, if you want to control a small wooden sword, there is no such problem. Because its weight is not as big as that of big stone, Bai Xiaochun obviously feels much more relaxed in the control, and with a month&rsquo;s practice, the speed is a little faster.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, Bai Xiaochun was not satisfied with the fact that he was lifting heavy weights lightly. His eyes turned red and he bit his teeth fiercely. That kind of ferocity came into being.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it!&rdquo; White small pure right hand pinches a Jue, this big stone unexpectedly flew to his head.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s forehead exudes cold sweat. He looks at the big stone on his head in fear, and tries his best to maintain the invisible spiritual silk thread. If it is broken, after the big stone falls down, although it can&rsquo;t kill him, it will also cause severe pain.</p>
<p>This time, there was a lot more time to insist. But half an hour later, with a bang, Bai Xiaochun screamed. The big stone fell down. For a long time, the rock shook and was pushed away. Bai Xiaochun climbed out of it.</p>
<p>He has skin protection, no injury, but the pain makes him grinning.</p>
<p>But his hard work is stronger. After a month&rsquo;s continuous efforts, the big stone has gradually changed from falling many times a day to once a day. At the end of the day, even Bai Xiaochun can do it once a day without failure.</p>
<p>And the big stone was slowly raised by him. At most, it reached a height of more than ten Zhang. If it was smashed, even Bai Xiaochun would be pale.</p>
<p>But only in this way can his mind be highly concentrated.</p>
<p>Gradually, he was able to keep the aura steady from the beginning to the end without interruption. However, he was not satisfied, so he no longer sat on his knees, but moved and maintained the aura as he moved.</p>
<p>As the difficulty increased, the roar in the yard rang again and again.</p>
<p>As time went by, when there were only three days left before Li Qinghou&rsquo;s Xiangyun mountain Xiaobi, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s yard was filled with a stone of seven or eight hundred jin in mid air. His figure moved rapidly in the courtyard, and he really achieved the degree that the stone remained motionless when he kept moving.</p>
<p>After moving for a long time, Bai Xiaochun stood in front of the wooden house and laughed. With a wave of his right hand, the stone in the air flew out of the yard and landed in the same place.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun pinches the Jue, and the small wooden sword flies out. It is still a simple cut forward, but the speed is so fast that it is already blurred. It is more than several times stronger than before.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s face was full of joy, and he made a quick trick.</p>
<p>The extreme speed, combined with the power of the wooden sword, immediately reached an amazing degree. For a moment, countless small wooden swords appeared in the yard, and the sword spirit was flying.</p>
<p>Finally, with his small sleeve swinging, all the imaginary shadows of wooden swords disappeared. Only one existed. He went straight to Bai Xiaochun and disappeared in his storage bag.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This time, we should be able to enter the top five.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun took a deep breath. Although he still didn&rsquo;t feel sure, the time was approaching. He could only sit on his knees and keep himself in the best condition.</p>
