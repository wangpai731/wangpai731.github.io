      <p>In addition to the dead water, on the ancient road to the West from Dawang village, on Monday, Xianhe and Xiaohuan walked slowly.</p>
<p>Xiaohuan&rsquo;s bright eyes looked around, only to see that the ancient road was overgrown with weeds and desolate. I walked out of Dawang village for a long time, but I didn&rsquo;t even see a human figure.</p>
<p>Looking from afar, I can see that this place is located in the wilderness. There are no mountains around. The sky is high and the grass is long. From time to time, the wind blows across the field. The green grass rolls like the waves, which is also beautiful and makes people have a broad mind.</p>
<p>On Monday, fairy&rsquo;s voice came lazily from the side and said, &ldquo;what are you looking at?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan said with a smile: &ldquo;Grandpa, when I came here a few days ago, I didn&rsquo;t look around carefully because I was in a hurry. It&rsquo;s a fine day today. It&rsquo;s a nice view! &quot;</p>
<p>On Monday, the immortal looked at the field outside the ancient road, but he was also refreshed. Then he said to himself, &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t it just a piece of weeds? What&rsquo;s good-looking? If it&rsquo;s made of gold, then&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grandpa!&rdquo; Xiaohuan called out, interrupted him, gave him a bad look, and said, &ldquo;why do you think about money all day long? It&rsquo;s so vulgar that there&rsquo;s a fairy character in your name!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vulgarity?&rdquo; On Monday, the fairy was furious and said, &ldquo;dare you scold me for being vulgar? My old man&rsquo;s family is a person of high rank outside the world, famous all over the world, who benefits the common people and all living beings&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan stared at him. Under the bright eyes of her granddaughter, the voice of the immortal became smaller and smaller, and more and more she said that she had no confidence. At last, she just raised her head and snorted, &ldquo;where do you know grandpa&rsquo;s strength, little girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan chuckled, shook her head and turned away. She was laughed at by her granddaughter on Monday. She was depressed and sighed: &ldquo;how could I have met you at the beginning? I knew that I would let you cry on the side of the road and never mind if you came!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan spits out her tongue, and her white face is innocent and lovely. She says with a smile, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s not Grandpa. Are you kind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Monday, the fairy glared at Xiaohuan and said angrily: &ldquo;good hearted ghost, raise you so big. All day long! &quot;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan is not afraid, nor angry. It seems that she has heard many of these words for a long time. She is close to Monday Xian. His eyes turned, and suddenly he said, &ldquo;Hey, grandpa! Why did you take me away? &quot;</p>
<p>On Monday, Xian Zheng was stunned. In fact, he and Xiao Huan have been used to it casually. Where can they really get angry.</p>
<p>However, when Xiaohuan heard this, he recalled some of the past, and then he looked sad. He sighed and said, &ldquo;I saw a girl who was only two or three years old in the city of Heyang. She was dying of hunger. She even cried hoarse. She was very soft for a moment, so I picked it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it. He suddenly stared at Xiaohuan and said, &ldquo;at that time, you were so smart that you didn&rsquo;t cry at once, which made me think that I really had a relationship with you. If I read this, I would never give up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan made a grimace to him, reached out his hand to hold on to the clothes of Monday fairy, and said with a coquettish smile: &ldquo;Grandpa, aren&rsquo;t you kind? There must be good news in the future. Ah! You see, these years. How much money have I made for you? &quot;</p>
<p>On Monday, the fairy nodded subconsciously and said with a smile: &ldquo;well, this is also&hellip;&rdquo; Suddenly woke up. Turning his face, he said angrily, &ldquo;what is it? Nonsense! &quot;</p>
<p>After a while, Xiaohuan chuckled, as if thinking of something, and said, &ldquo;well, Grandpa, what did you do when you went to Heyang city. Isn&rsquo;t that right at the foot of Qingyun Mountain? I remember that you never wanted to get close to it. In recent years, it seems that only ten years ago, for the sake of the Qingyun disciple named Zhang Xiaofan, we looked curiously at the past, but we were not close. &quot;</p>
<p>Zhou Yixian&rsquo;s face was a little dim. He sighed and said: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not your father&rsquo;s remains, it&rsquo;s in Heyang city. When I was on his death day, I stayed in front of his grave for a long time. When I came out, I saw you on the street. I was very sad. I looked at you pitifully and adopted you. &quot;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan listened, and for a while she was silent. After a while, she said, &ldquo;Grandpa, we haven&rsquo;t seen dad for another ten years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Monday, the immortal thought a little and nodded: &ldquo;yes, another ten years have passed in a flash.&rdquo; Here, a wry smile, said: &ldquo;well, anyway, we have no place for a while, let&rsquo;s go to Heyang city and see your father!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan nodded at once and said, &ldquo;OK!&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Monday, Xian waved and said, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go! It&rsquo;s boring in the wild. &quot;</p>
<p>They went forward and walked. Xiaohuan, after all, was young, and it was an old thing. With her vivacity, she soon got rid of that little bit of hurt. As they walked, they looked around at the scenery. Suddenly they looked back and said to Grandpa, &ldquo;Grandpa, look behind us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; said the fairy on Monday He said, looking back.</p>
<p>Small ring way: &ldquo;that wild dog way long seems to still follow us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Monday, Xian looked carefully, and sure enough, he saw the wild dog Taoist who, for some reason, followed him from afar and walked slowly, keeping a distance with them all the time. At this moment, seeing that they suddenly stopped to look back, the wild dog seemed to be stunned, and even stopped. There was hesitation and a little embarrassment on his face. Then he stood aside and looked up at the sky.</p>
<p>On Monday, Xian looked at him suspiciously. He turned his head and pulled Xiaohuan to move on. At the same time, he whispered, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s that guy coming to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Xiaohuan wonders:&rdquo; you ask me who I ask to go</p>
<p>On Monday, Xian smothers, suddenly stares at Xiao Huan and says, &ldquo;did that guy move his heart and want to be unfaithful to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan was startled. Her face turned red. She said angrily, &ldquo;Grandpa, you can say that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t I say,&rdquo; said the fairy on Monday, &ldquo;now that the world is full of bad people, you are beautiful, and it&rsquo;s hard to say that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan gave him a white look and said, &ldquo;according to me! In the past, the leader of wild dog was in the demon sect. Although he had a bad reputation, he never heard that he had killed women, but he killed people, set fire and robbed women in the daytime. It&rsquo;s said that he had done a lot of things. &quot;</p>
<p>Zhou Yixian&rsquo;s face turned white, and he became nervous at once, and said, &ldquo;that guy shouldn&rsquo;t want to rob our two poor people?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan snorted and said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s hard to say. Besides, I&rsquo;m afraid your silver is much more than that of the poor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Monday, Xian hurriedly lowered his voice and said, &ldquo;Shh! Don&rsquo;t talk so loudly. &quot; With that, he looked around, frowned and said, &ldquo;no one is here. It&rsquo;s the best place to rob. Shall we run faster? &quot;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan was stunned, but saw that on Monday, the immortal reached into her arms and took out a yellow paper sign. It seems that he wanted to use his &ldquo;ancestral secret&rdquo; skill to escape, but he was angry and funny. He quickly grabbed Monday fairy and said: &ldquo;Grandpa. You wait. &quot;</p>
<p>On Monday, Xian took a look at his back and said, &ldquo;that guy is following up again. What are you waiting for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan said with a smile: &ldquo;Grandpa, although you are a secret skill handed down by your ancestors, where will we come out after you. You can&rsquo;t control it. I can tell you that we are not far away from the dead Ze now. In case you get into it, we should be very sad. &quot;</p>
<p>On Monday, xianyileng said, &ldquo;we are not so bad luck, are we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan took a look at him and said, &ldquo;do you think your luck is good or bad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Monday, Xian thought about it and then said firmly, &ldquo;poor!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan smiled and said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s over, so we can&rsquo;t take risks.&rdquo; Said, she is close to Monday. His eyes beckoned to his left hand, and he whispered, &ldquo;Grandpa, you forget that I have a bottle elder sister&rsquo;s body protection magic weapon here. Besides, the wild dog Taoist is not a devil Taoist. It&rsquo;s not difficult for us to deal with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Monday, Xian bowed his head and pondered, then took a long breath and said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re right, ah! I don&rsquo;t know why. I&rsquo;m always on the edge these days. Uneasy. It seems that most of them see too many cultivation masters in the dead water, which makes the wild dog look high. &quot;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan chuckled and said, &ldquo;besides, the dog Taoist doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a bad guy. Didn&rsquo;t you lend us the umbrella? &quot;</p>
<p>On Monday, the fairy &ldquo;Pooh&rdquo; and said: &ldquo;what we are? I lent it to you. I&rsquo;ve been drenched in the rain for half my life. You girl is indifferent. It&rsquo;s really unfilial.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan spits out her tongue. &ldquo;Grandpa,&rdquo; he said with a smile, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve covered it for you. You don&rsquo;t want it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Monday, the fairy snorted again, and walked forward, saying, &ldquo;you are the same as your unfilial father, you make me angry all day. It&rsquo;s disobedience!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan smiles and shakes her head and follows up.</p>
<p>Behind the ancient road, the wild dog Taoist hears the laughter from the front, frowns and changes his face, but finally he keeps up.</p>
<p>Between heaven and earth, the wind is blowing through the wilderness.</p>
<p>The walk was another half hour. On Monday, Xian was a little tired. He held on to Xiao Huan and said, &ldquo;have a rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan nodded, looked at a half big Bluestone on the side of the road, walked over to take a pat, and said: &ldquo;Grandpa, sit here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Monday, the fairy nodded, leaned the bamboo pole with the white cloth of &ldquo;immortal guiding the way&rdquo; in his hand against the bluestone, sat down on the stone, couldn&rsquo;t help but gasping, shook his head slightly, and said: &ldquo;recently, how can I always feel that I&rsquo;m not fit? How long have I walked, and then I began to gasp?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan is taking out the water bottle from the bag. When she hears this, her eyes flash a bit of sadness. She comes to hand the water bottle to Monday fairy and says, &ldquo;Grandpa, have some water!&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Monday, the fairy nodded, took the kettle, held up his head and took a few sips, took a long breath, then turned his head and looked back. As expected, there was a figure behind him, standing far away.</p>
<p>On Monday, the immortal looked for a long time, then smiled and stopped caring about him. He handed over the kettle to Xiaohuan. Unexpectedly, when he looked back, he was stunned. Xiaohuan sat beside him. He didn&rsquo;t know when to start. He had another red ice sugar gourd in his hand and ate it with relish.</p>
<p>On Monday, Xianda shook his head and said: &ldquo;I say Xiaohuan! You don&rsquo;t see how old you are, how can you still like a little girl, so like eating this ice sugar gourd? &quot;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan spat at the roadside and spit out a small grain of ice sugar gourd seeds. She smiled at the fairy on Monday and said, &ldquo;but they love it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhou Yixian was dumbfounded and sighed: &ldquo;ten years ago, in the city of Heyang, there were so many pastries and snacks. Why did I just run to the side of the road to buy this ice sugar gourd for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, she shook her head and sighed. Xiaohuan smiled but didn&rsquo;t speak. She tasted the delicious food in her hand. Maybe under the influence of the red appearance of the ice sugar gourd, her lips seemed to add a touch of color.</p>
<p>Zhou Yixian sat for a while, feeling his strength gradually recovered, so he planned to call Xiaohuan to continue on his way. Unexpectedly, just after turning his head, he suddenly saw a pair of feet in front of him.</p>
<p>On Monday, the fairy was shocked and said to himself, &ldquo;could it not have been this oversight that the wild dog guy took the opportunity to sneak in, and it was a good thing?&rdquo;? It seems that I can&rsquo;t believe what the little girl said. I have been walking around the world for more than 100 years. Can&rsquo;t the tortoise fall and the sewer capsize today?</p>
<p>This side of the wishful thinking, just want to call Xiaohuan up, suddenly only to listen to the voice of the person in front of the gentle and calm, light way: &ldquo;you still look at people?&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Monday, both Xian and Xiao Huan stood up.</p>
<p>Looking up, I only saw a middle-aged man with fine eyebrows and square faces, elegant eyebrows and bright eyes. The forehead is full, and there is a strong momentum in elegance. It&rsquo;s a Confucian robe with a purple jade pendant on the waist. It&rsquo;s exquisite and transparent. It&rsquo;s auspicious. It&rsquo;s very beautiful. It&rsquo;s not ordinary.</p>
<p>But his forehead and sideburns, but with his appearance does not match a lot of white hair, see more vicissitudes.</p>
<p>On Monday, Xian&rsquo;s face suddenly became strange. He stared at the man. Under the unnoticed sleeve, his hands were tightly clenched into fists, but on his face, after his consternation, he was a little excited, a little gratified and a little vicissitudes of life.</p>
<p>Xiaohuan&rsquo;s eyes turned from the face and went back to Grandpa&rsquo;s body. Then he found that Monday fairy&rsquo;s face didn&rsquo;t seem to be right. He was trying to say something. Monday fairy suddenly said: &ldquo;Xiaohuan. You go to the side for a while, and wait until grandpa asks you to come back. &quot;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan is shocked. It&rsquo;s never happened, but on Monday, Xian looks serious. It&rsquo;s not like joking, but it seems that they have known each other in the past. At the moment, they should go back and sort out the burden casually and walk back.</p>
<p>She walked along. From time to time, he looked back, but saw that grandpa and the middle-aged man were still standing there face to face, as if they still didn&rsquo;t speak. She was a little worried. She had just met the middle-aged man for the first time, but only in a short time, somehow she was afraid of him for a while.</p>
<p>For more than ten years, she has been following Zhou Xian. She never knew that Grandpa would know such a powerful person!</p>
<p>She was thinking. She was in a trance. She didn&rsquo;t realize that she had gone a long way. Suddenly, she found another figure in front of her. She stopped quickly and almost ran into the man. When she fixed her eyes, she was a wild dog Taoist. She said: &ldquo;sorry, Taoist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the face of the wild dog Taoist priest at the moment was also greatly wrong. The color of horror flashed on his face, and his eyes were staring straight forward, full of fear and fear.</p>
<p>Xiaohuan was surprised again. He looked down his line of sight. He saw the dog Taoist. He was the middle-aged man.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know who that man is. He will make the wild dog Taoist so afraid?</p>
<p>Xiaohuan thought in her heart, and couldn&rsquo;t help whispering to the wild dog Taoist, &ldquo;Taoist, who is that man? Do you know him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as the body of the wild dog Taoist shakes, it seems that he has returned to his mind, but the color of fear on his face is still unchanged. Looking at the small ring around him, nah NAH says, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you recognize him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan nodded: &ldquo;yes! I saw this man for the first time today, but I think grandpa seems to know him. By the way, do you recognize him? Who is he? &quot;</p>
<p>The wild dog Taoist&rsquo;s mouth moved, as if to say something, but somehow, suddenly he was silent, and his eyes were straight looking at the middle-aged man in front.</p>
<p>Xiaohuan frowned, and intuitively thought that the response of the wild dog Taoist was a little strange. He was afraid. Now he seemed to be a little more angry!</p>
<p>On Monday, Xian stood side by side with the middle-aged man, standing on the edge of the ancient road, looking out into the wilderness.</p>
<p>Breeze blowing, sideburns white hair, as if also in the story of time wasted, the vicissitudes of life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t we met for many years?&rdquo; Suddenly, the middle-aged man said.</p>
<p>On Monday, the immortal looked at the distance, and his face was complicated. After a while, he said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s been decades!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man smiled and said, &ldquo;are you ok?&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Monday, the immortal was silent for a long time and said: &ldquo;wandering around the world, playing in the world, it&rsquo;s not good, it&rsquo;s not bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man seemed to have some feelings, turned to look at Monday fairy, said: &ldquo;are you still blaming me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Monday, fairy smiled bitterly, shook his head and said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re not sorry for me, what do I blame you for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man smiled and said, &ldquo;in fact, it&rsquo;s not bad for you to open your mind and travel around the world. Now you want to come here and live a life of immortals. It&rsquo;s not in vain that there is an immortal character in your name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Monday, the immortal looked at him and suddenly said, &ldquo;if you want to live a life like this, what&rsquo;s the difficulty, old friend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man suddenly listened to the words &ldquo;old friend&rdquo; said by the immortal on Monday, but he couldn&rsquo;t help being stunned, but then he smiled and looked into the distance and said slowly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m different from you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are different from me, of course,&rdquo; said the immortal on Monday. &ldquo;When you were young, you had a strong sense of power. Now, I don&rsquo;t think you can let it go. &quot;</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s eyebrows wrinkled, and there seemed to be a flash of anger in his eyes. It seemed that no one dared speak to him like this.</p>
<p>But when he looked back at Monday fairy, he saw that he was covered with white hair, much older than himself. Suddenly, he was at a loss, and his anger disappeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you look so old?&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Monday, Xian shook his head and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m old. It&rsquo;s because you have accomplished your cultivation. You shouldn&rsquo;t have&hellip; &quot; At this point, he looked a little hesitant, but finally said: &ldquo;I heard about your daughter, you&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the man shook his head slowly, blocking the words of Monday fairy, and suddenly said: &ldquo;when we were young, you were at the foot of foxqishan. Do you remember to use &ldquo;Tiangang divination&rdquo; to make a divination for my life style</p>
<p>On Monday, the immortal was stunned.</p>
<p>The man looked up at the sky and said slowly: &ldquo;I still remember clearly that you were young and vigorous at that time. You said to me that I was too angry and killed my wife and children. If you don&rsquo;t have the skill to crack it, you will lose your wife and have no children under your knees. Now it&rsquo;s true that one by one. &quot; Said. His voice grew bleak.</p>
<p>On Monday, the immortal lowered his head. After a long time, he suddenly looked up and said, &ldquo;now we are all half buried people. I also have something to say directly to you. &quot;</p>
<p>The man seemed slightly surprised and said, &ldquo;you say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Monday, the immortal stared at him and said, &ldquo;I lied to you in my nonsense. I&rsquo;ve been bothered by those fortune telling things since I was a child. How can I learn them patiently. As for the magic of Tiangang, there is such a saying naturally, but how can I understand it? So at the beginning of those words, but I see that you have a proud face, but angry just so deliberately said. Don&rsquo;t keep it in your heart! &quot;</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s body shook. It seemed that he never thought that the immortal would say such words from Monday&rsquo;s mouth. After a while, he suddenly shook his head and laughed loudly. He only saw that all the people who laughed later bent down. Where was the dignity when they met?</p>
<p>In the distance, Xiao Huan and the wild dog Taoist were dazed.</p>
<p>For a while, the man stopped laughing slowly, and his face gradually returned to calm and dignity, but his eyes looked as if he had suffered a little more.</p>
<p>On Monday, the fairy looked at him in silence.</p>
<p>They stood side by side for a long time. Then on Monday, the immortal said: &ldquo;how can you come here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man looked at him and said, &ldquo;aren&rsquo;t you always conceited and smart? What do you say? &quot;</p>
<p>On Monday, the fairy snorted and said, &ldquo;are you going to die?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man said leisurely, &ldquo;yes, I am going there.</p>
<p>Why, don&rsquo;t you want to see it? Old friends? &quot;</p>
<p>On Monday, the fairy turned his mouth and said, &ldquo;you have a bad reputation. It&rsquo;s strange that I walk with you. I&rsquo;d better stay away from you. &quot;</p>
<p>The man looked at the immortal on Monday, and suddenly he couldn&rsquo;t help laughing. Then he said: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a rare fate to see an old man in the ancient way of the world. I see you today. I don&rsquo;t know when I&rsquo;ll see you again. Take care of yourself. &quot;</p>
<p>On Monday, the fairy snorted and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m living a good life. I don&rsquo;t want to die, but your enemies are more than the foxes on the mountain. I&rsquo;d better think about yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan stood by the road and waited for a long time. Suddenly, Grandpa and the man came together, hurriedly welcomed him up and went to Grandpa&rsquo;s side. The middle-aged man took a look at Xiaohuan and then fell on the wild dog Taoist behind him.</p>
<p>As soon as the face of the wild dog Taoist changed, he lowered his head slowly.</p>
<p>The man looked at him for a few eyes, and suddenly said, &ldquo;you are the wild dog Taoist around GUI Li?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The face of the wild dog Taoist was more frightened. After a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, he whispered, &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Huan stood beside the fairy on Monday and asked in a low voice, &ldquo;Grandpa, who is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhou Yixian hasn&rsquo;t answered yet, but the middle-aged man seems to even listen to this little voice, turns around, smiles and says, &ldquo;why, doesn&rsquo;t the little girl know me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan was shocked and shook her head in a daze.</p>
<p>The man smiled and said, &ldquo;you can tell me to go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan is stunned.</p>
<p>The man took a deep look at Monday fairy, suddenly waved his sleeve robe, turned around and strode away without turning back. Step between the own shares look at the world&rsquo;s momentum, slowly distributed away.</p>
<p>People behind him saw the figure go along the ancient road to the direction of the dead water, and suddenly heard the man sing loudly: &ldquo;the end of the earth road, never far away. Children&rsquo;s idea, always infatuated. The sky is high and the sea is 80000 feet wide. All the people are prostrate. Star WanDian, the moon is bright, the sky is cold, cold as frost. It&rsquo;s funny that everything is like a ruminant dog. Who will turn over the clouds for the rain?&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>This song is ancient and clumsy. Although it is not soft and pleasant to listen to, it has a powerful meaning in the desolation.</p>
<p>But they saw the sky, the ancient road above, long white clouds, lonely wilderness, the man walked hand in hand, unspeakable rebellious.</p>
<p>The song was fading, and the man had gone far. (to be continued. )</p>
