      <p>After returning from Yougu, another half a month later, Zhang Xiaofan had been in Qingyunmen for three full years, and also ended his bamboo cutting career, but at the end of the time he handed over the results, even blushing for himself.</p>
<p>Because of that inexplicable trip to the valley, Zhang Xiaofan often felt dizzy, lack of energy and lack of blood in the next half month, and the whole person was particularly tired. He secretly speculated in his heart that it might have been caused by the massive bleeding that he vaguely saw when he was unconscious that day. But he didn&rsquo;t have any wounds throughout his body, and he was anxious and dared not ask Master, so he had to be buried in his heart.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that he didn&rsquo;t speak, but his body responded. Normally, at least two large black knot bamboos can be cut off, and now they are panting without a few cuts, sweating and sweating, and even one black knot bamboo can&rsquo;t be cut in half a day. In fact, this is no wonder. That day in the valley, &ldquo;Blood Eater&rdquo; almost sucked half of his body&rsquo;s blood. If he hadn&rsquo;t been strong, he would have been bedridden. However, Zhang Xiaofan wanted to cut bamboo as before, which was also delusional.</p>
<p>This situation persisted until half a month later, Zhang Xiaofan felt a slight improvement in his body, and his mental strength was better. But the homework of cutting bamboo was also over at this time. On the last day, under the watchful eye of Song Daren and others who came to the inspection and acceptance, Zhang Xiaofan tried his best and finally cut off a black bamboo before the end of the hour.</p>
<p>Song Daren and others looked at each other dumbly, and only Tian Ling&rsquo;er came up and patted his shoulder with a smile: &ldquo;Xiaofan, it&rsquo;s okay, you have a sister, I&rsquo;m a dozen or so, it&rsquo;s already very good .&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan smiled bitterly.</p>
<p>Dinner was very full, and Dazhufeng sat in the dining room. After Tian Tianyi and his wife sat down, Song Daren first told Zhang Xiaofan that Tian Tian was not sneering, and did not even look at Zhang Xiaofan, but Su Ru smiled and said: &ldquo;Ah, Xiaofan, you have come to our Dazhufeng for three years. Yeah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan quickly said: &ldquo;Yes, maid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru sighed softly and said, &ldquo;Ah, the time passed so fast that three years have passed.&rdquo; She said, she suddenly paused, raised her voice, and said to the other six disciples: &ldquo;Do you feel this way?&rdquo; what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the disciples at Dazhufeng were shocked and immediately sat upright, saying, &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru snorted and said, &ldquo;Now your younger brothers have grown up, but you haven&rsquo;t even entered the country in the past three years. Do you want to anger me and your master!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everyone dared not speak, but all set their sights on Song Daren. Under the urging of other teachers, Song Daren said sternly: &ldquo;Teacher, rest assured, we will be fighting this time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru put the word &ldquo;unbelief&rdquo; on his face, and just about to speak, Tian was not easy to say suddenly: &ldquo;Lao Liu.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Du Bishu was full of excitement, looking up and surprised, &ldquo;Master, do you call me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian is not easy to say lightly: &ldquo;These **** watch you dance in the kitchen in your spare time, what&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Du Bishu&rsquo;s face was red, his mouth gaped, and he said, &ldquo;Master, how do you see it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru said, &ldquo;Huh,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;What must I do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Du Bishu hesitated for a while and whispered: &ldquo;The disciple wants to see if he can make those things move&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everyone immediately moved, the realm of &ldquo;dispelling objects&rdquo; is the fundamental foundation for practicing magic in the Qingyunmen Taoist method, and it is unthinkable to reach the fourth level of the Taiji Xuanqing Dao Yuqing Realm.</p>
<p>Tian nodded easily. Although there was nothing on the face, there was still a glance of joy in his eyes, saying: &ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Du Bishu whispered: &ldquo;It seems to move a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boom&rdquo;, everyone was in an uproar, and all were pleasantly surprised. The old five Lu Daxin sitting beside him patted his shoulder with a smile on his face. The opposite Su Ru also smiled and said, &ldquo;Good boy, I can&rsquo;t think of your arrogance, when?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Du Bishu&rsquo;s audience was infected, and he also relaxed, saying: &ldquo;Just recently, the first couple of people practiced in the room, and suddenly found that under the mind, the cup on the table moved a little, and I guess it will be me He broke through the third floor.&rdquo; When he was here, he smiled rather embarrassedly, and said, &ldquo;But the disciple has no heart, can&rsquo;t believe it, he often tempted and didn&rsquo;t expect to be discovered by Master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian was not easy to smile and said: &ldquo;It is like this. Although the functions of the fourth and third floors of Yuqingjing are very different, but the initial cultivation is not obvious. You are smart, you are late to start, but you can’t think of it. &quot;</p>
<p>Everyone laughed and congratulated each other, during which Tian Linger said: &ldquo;Six Brothers, did you decide what magic weapon to practice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Du Bishu froze for a while and said, &ldquo;No, I just confirmed from Master&rsquo;s mouth that I have reached the fourth floor, and I haven&rsquo;t had time to think about it yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru smiled and said: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, these couples are **** and think slowly, but you know the temper of your Master, you never force you to practice the Immortal Sword, whatever you like, go after you think about it Find materials.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was extremely envious, seeing Brother Six smiling with teeth on his face, and hearing Tian Tian said: &ldquo;Lao Liu.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Du Bishu quickly said: &ldquo;Master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Yidao said: &ldquo;According to our old example of Qingyunmen, disciples who practiced to the fourth floor of Xuanqing Dao of Taiji would have to travel down the mountain to search the world, and at the same time look for good materials and spiritual weapons to cultivate magic weapons. You have your own chances for chemical industry. You are ready to go down the mountain in a few days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Du Bishu froze for a moment, a little bit reluctant in his eyes, a little happy, and whispered: &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; After thinking of it, he said, &ldquo;But Master, the meals here are always the responsibility of the disciples, but the disciples After leaving&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Daxin beside him laughed and said: &ldquo;What are you afraid of, did you still have me before you started, rest assured, hungry will not die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Du Bishu and everyone laughed. Only Tian Linger laughed aside: &ldquo;Brother Wu, you&rsquo;re so embarrassed to say that for the food you cooked, I could eat it as a nightmare when I was a kid!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Daxin&rsquo;s face was red, and everyone laughed. After the laughter stopped, Tian was not easy to say lightly: &ldquo;Later seven will do the kitchen work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everyone was stunned, Lu Daxin surprised: &ldquo;Master, he is still young&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian was not easy to squint, and looked at Zhang Xiaofan, Zhang Xiaofan quickly said: &ldquo;Master, rest assured, I often follow the six senior brothers in the kitchen to help, will do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian didn&rsquo;t easily nod, and didn&rsquo;t say much, waved his hand: &ldquo;Eat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Three days later, Du Bishu stopped and cleared up the affairs in the kitchen, and went down the mountain. Among the brothers in the past three years, Du Bishu is the youngest and has a lively temperament,</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan is the closest to him. Now that he has gone this way, Zhang Xiaofan is quite upset, but only feels a little lonely on Dazhu Peak.</p>
<p>Subsequently, Zhang Xiaofan began his second &ldquo;homework&rdquo; in Qingyunmen-cooking.</p>
<p>That day was the first time he officially cooked rice and cooked vegetables. He was busy in the kitchen alone all morning. Taomi was very busy in washing vegetables. Unconsciously, at noon, Tian was not easy to wait for someone to enter the dining room. Seeing that the table was set as usual, Zhang Xiaofan was sitting at the end of the table, hands clasped together, trembling, anyone could feel the tension.</p>
<p>The people sat down, and Tian Tian was not able to speak. Instead, Su Ru looked at Zhang Xiaofan, and a smile appeared on his face, saying, &ldquo;Xiaofan, how does it feel to cook for the first time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan opened his mouth but couldn&rsquo;t figure out what to say. Tian was not easy to snort and said, &ldquo;Eat.&rdquo; The disciples responded, raised their chopsticks and put them in the mouth.</p>
<p>There was silence in the dining room.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was so nervous that his heart jumped to his throat, and his sweat swept out on his forehead, whispering, &ldquo;Master, brother, I, I&rsquo;m not doing well, you, you&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow, it&rsquo;s so delicious!&rdquo; Tian Ling&rsquo;er shouted suddenly, and couldn&rsquo;t help but put another piece of bamboo shoots in his mouth. Zhang Xiaofan stayed for a while, and all the brothers smiled, nodded, and chopsticks like praise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unexpectedly, the younger brother actually has this hand, great, great!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well (ambiguous), better than Lao Wu, no, both Lao Wu and Lao Liu are delicious, hehe!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this time, it was difficult for Lian Tian to pinch a few more chopsticks, nodded, and smiled a little in his eyes. Zhang Xiaofan looked at his eyes, satisfied for a while.</p>
<p>Since then, Zhang Xiaofan has been doing it in the kitchen. He hasn&rsquo;t shown any talents in Taoist practice, but he is quite talented in cooking, and he has no skills to master it. The cooked food is delicious and far better than others. In his heart, as long as Tian was not easy to nod his head slightly, it was the greatest joy.</p>
<p>Time hurried, and another half a year later, seeing the &ldquo;Seven Vessels Meeting Martial Arts&rdquo; approaching once at Qingyunmen Yijiazi, not only Su Ru, but Tian Tian also began to urge his disciples. Everyone concentrated on cultivating the Tao, but no one came to disturb Zhang Xiaofan. Anyway, everyone had little hope of him.</p>
<p>As for Zhang Xiaofan, he didn’t care, he was busy in the kitchen every day, but he also realized that he was a little happy from the pots and pans. In his free time, he took care of himself and practiced Taoism, and he practiced the &ldquo;Great Brahma Prajna&rdquo; every night. The days have passed peacefully.</p>
<p>During this time, the gray monkey he brought back from the valley had lived with him for half a year, and the monkeys were already very close to each other. Zhang Xiaofan also gave it a name—Little Gray. The name is the same as his own, plain and unremarkable.</p>
<p>Since he started to work in the kitchen, Xiaohui went to the water platform to get the moon first. He often ran to the kitchen with him, grabbed a bamboo shoot in the east, grabbed a fruit in the west, and ate it all day.</p>
<p>Although he was fat, he still had a rival on this big bamboo peak, that is, Tian Huang, a big yellow dog that was not easy to raise since childhood.</p>
<p>Somehow, the big yellow dog always looked at the monkey in his eyes, and he always barked when he saw Xiaohui in the first days, and scared Xiaohui to hide in the high places. Finally, it was barely acquiesced that Xiao Hui was a member of Dazhu Peak, but every time he met, he gritted his teeth and made a vicious look. When Xiao Hui was scared and squealed, Da Huang only cried a few times. , Soaring dog head, shook his tail, and walked aside.</p>
<p>From autumn to winter, the weather on Dazhu Peak is gradually getting colder. Except for Tian Tian and his wife who are practicing high and deep, they are not afraid of this ordinary coldness and warmth. The rest of the disciples slowly added their clothes.</p>
<p>On this day, the rare sunshine and warmth on Dazhu Peak, Zhang Xiaofan finished his work in the kitchen, came out, stretched out, sat down next to a pine tree outside, leaned on the trunk, squinted his eyes, and comfortably Enjoy the sun.</p>
<p>After sitting for a while, at the moment when he was about to sleep, Zhang Xiaofan suddenly heard a few barks from the front, and opened his eyes, but Da Huang also lay on the ground in front of the sun lazily, but Xiao Hui Step by step from the back to rhubarb.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was very surprised. Rhubarb often ran to the kitchen to eat food on weekdays, and he knew him well, so he couldn’t understand the relationship between the monkey and the dog. He didn’t want the sun to appear to the west today. Xiao Hui will take the initiative to approach rhubarb! Zhang Xiaofan suddenly got his spirit, staring closely at the front.</p>
<p>I saw that Xiaohui quickly approached rhubarb. Although rhubarb could not see the things behind him, but when his nose moved, he immediately smelled something strange behind him. When he looked back, he immediately opened his big mouth and exposed his fangs. .</p>
<p>Xiao Hui shrank, still looking a little scared, but the monkey&rsquo;s eyes turned a few times, his right hand was raised, and he shook in front of Da Huang.</p>
<p>Rhubarb didn&rsquo;t take it seriously at first, and kept shouting at Xiaohui, but he sniffed his nose a few times later, as if he smelled something. The two dogs stared at Xiaohui&rsquo;s hand, blinking, and not moving. He didn&rsquo;t move and didn&rsquo;t bark anymore. He opened his mouth and stretched out the old and long tongue, and even the dog&rsquo;s tail began to shake, as a sign of friendship.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was so surprised that when he looked at it, he couldn&rsquo;t help but laugh. He turned out to have a fleshy bone in his hand, and the fragrance was overflowing. He also heard it from afar. This is what he used to boil soup, because he knew that rhubarb loves to eat this thing, so after cooking, it was specially sealed and placed on a high place. Unexpectedly, Xiaohui didn&rsquo;t know when he stole a piece. It came close to rhubarb.</p>
<p>At the moment, Xiao Hui shook it twice, and then threw the bones in front of Rhubarb. The mouth of the rhubarb had drooled for a long time, and immediately opened his mouth to bite the bones in his mouth.</p>
<p>Looking at Dahuang&rsquo;s appearance, Xiaohui squeaked twice, approaching rhubarb cautiously, hesitated, and reached out to touch Dahuang&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>Rhubarb suddenly whispered, and Xiao Hui quickly drew his hands back, but after a while, he couldn&rsquo;t help but reached out and touched Rhubarb&rsquo;s head again. This time Rhubarb didn&rsquo;t respond, only busy nibbling the bones, Xiao Hui put his hand on Rhubarb&rsquo;s head, gently *** Rhubarb&rsquo;s bright and soft yellow hair, Rhubarb actually felt very comfortable, shrunk, yelled There was a cry, but it was completely hostile.</p>
<p>The little gray guts became a little bit bigger, smiled and yelled twice, and began to upset the rhubarb fur. It seemed to be looking for lice. In the meantime rhubarb turned back, and actually licked the little gray with his tongue. This monkey and dog are very intimate. It becomes faster than anything.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan looked stunned straight, thinking that this little gray can be really smart, but it seems that the meat and bones will be hidden more secretly in the future.</p>
<p>He was thinking in this way, and suddenly there was a sound of breaking the sky above his head, two white lights galloped from the west, rhubarb seemed to be startled, barked loudly at the white light, and Xiao Hui stretched out his hand on it Touching the top of the head twice, it seemed to be comforting, but it was very effective. Rhubarb actually calmed down immediately.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan watched the two white lights fall in front of the main hall &ldquo;Shoujingtang&rdquo;. After a flash of light, two people appeared, one standing tall and elegant, the white clothes fluttering, very handsome.</p>
<p>The other person is a teenager, shorter than him, 15 or 6 years old.</p>
<p>Suddenly Zhang Xiaofan held his breath, and a once-forgotten sorrow slowly emerged from the deep heart, because the other one looked lonely back!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jing Yu?&rdquo; He stood up and his voice became hoarse and cried out.</p>
<p>The young man was shocked, and immediately turned around, his eyes wide open, his mouth wide open, as if he wanted to say something, but in the end, after a thousand words, only two words were turned into:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Xiaofan!&rdquo;</p>
