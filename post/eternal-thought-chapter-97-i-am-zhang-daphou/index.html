      <p>At this moment, the disciples around have been buzzing in their minds, staring at the two people on the stage, and everyone&rsquo;s mind has set off a huge wave.</p>
<p>The people on the south bank are in a trance. They finally understand why Bai Xiaochun can survive in the first World War of the Luochen family and why he can be listed as a glorious disciple!</p>
<p>&ldquo;So He&rsquo;s so strong This is the only shock in the heart of every disciple on the south bank.</p>
<p>And the people on the north bank, at the moment, the complexity in their hearts has reached the extreme.</p>
<p>On the terrace, many elders of Lingxi clan all look at Lu qimang. When they look at Bai Xiaochun, what they see in their mind is the silver light of her whole body and the amazing blow just now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s immortality and longevity, to the extent of silver skin!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The last blow just now is Break the lock</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect that the immortal longevity work, which almost no one can cultivate, is actually accomplished by someone! It&rsquo;s a pity that although the immortal longevity work is powerful and mysterious, it has only fragments&hellip; &quot; The crowd took a deep breath, and one by one the words came out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking forward to the fact that some of them will become the inheritance sequence in a few years.&rdquo; The leader sighed. He also knew that the expectation was far away and the inheritance sequence was too difficult. Thinking of this, he could not help looking at Li Qinghou.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Within two Jiazi, stepping into the golden elixir, we can become the inheritance sequence. Our generation Only youth has hope. &quot;</p>
<p>At the same time, the ghost tooth waved his right hand, and immediately a green light flew out and turned into a big flag of green wood, which he directly stabbed on the ground in front of him.</p>
<p>He sat down with his knees crossed, and his eyes were full of fighting spirit when he suddenly raised his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bai Xiaochun, you are worth my untiing the seal!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;First seal, open!&rdquo; He suddenly opened his mouth, pinched his right hand, pointed to the center of his eyebrows, and hummed. His body trembled at this moment, and black silk came out of his body crazily. When he spread around, his body suddenly doubled, and a stronger breath broke out directly.</p>
<p>The strength of this breath is the ultimate state of building foundation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sixth finger!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The eighth finger!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The tenth finger!&rdquo; The ghost teeth roared, pinching Jue toward Bai Xiaochun, and actually unfolded five fingers in succession. Any finger was much stronger than before. At the moment, it was all unfolded. The earth and the earth were shaking. The huge ghost claw fell from the sky like a rainbow. You can see it from a long distance. You can see it straight to Bai Xiaochun and roar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This Is this still the way to condense gas? This is clearly the magic power of building foundation</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the first time for me to see the condensation gas disciple unfold such a shocking method!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only the secret arts can do it. I have ten secret arts of Lingxi sect, and each of them can be achieved in the condensation of Qi!&rdquo; All around, all of them took a breath of horror.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s eyes contracted. The ghost teeth at this moment put more pressure on him than before. However, he was not as good as he had been in the first world war with the Lord Luochen.</p>
<p>After all, this is not a battle between life and death, but the scene at that time was life-and-death!</p>
<p>Even so, although it&rsquo;s not a fight between life and death, Bai Xiaochun doesn&rsquo;t want to lose. If he doesn&rsquo;t have a chance, he just wants to be the first!</p>
<p>Not for the false name, only for Li Qinghou to look at himself, the eyes will appear in the gratification.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s enough!</p>
<p>Blood appeared in Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s eyes. As soon as he swung his sleeve and pinched the formula, the spiritual power in his body instantly diffused. Then, a purple tripod appeared in an instant. One, three Five!</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, the five purple tripods turned into five ghost claws. At the same time, his golden and black sword suddenly flew out and turned into a golden light. There was a shadow of golden crow in it. The sharp sound came out and went straight to the ghost tooth!</p>
<p>And Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s body also rushed out at this moment, ignoring the five ghost claws, and unfolded at full speed towards the ghost teeth.</p>
<p>The sound of the roar spread in an instant. When the five purple tripods touched the five ghost claws, they all collapsed and dissipated. The five ghost claws were also blurred. The momentum dissipated by half, but the speed was still the same. In an instant, Bai Xiaochun caught up with Bai Xiaochun. When he directly blew away, a crane scream came out of Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s body, and the divine crane shield appeared.</p>
<p>The five ghost claws touch the God crane, and the sound reverberates. The five ghost claws are even more dim, and even appear to be broken. However, the God crane also sends out a cry of sorrow, which dissipates in an instant, and returns to the small shield, unable to stop it.</p>
<p>The five ghost claws hit Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s body without any hindrance. However, at the moment of touching, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s whole body was covered with black light, which was what Li Qinghou had given him to protect his life.</p>
<p>The five ghost claws, at the moment of touching the black light, could not continue to support. Under the deafening sound, all of them collapsed. Bai Xiaochun ejected a mouthful of blood, and the black light dissipated all over his body. Except for a mouthful of blood, he was undamaged, with a flash of essence in his eyes. With the Jinwu sword, he was within five Zhangs of the ghost tooth.</p>
<p>And the Jinwu sword is faster, less than a Zhang away from the ghost tooth.</p>
<p>The ghost tooth&rsquo;s face changed. He grasped the big flag in front of him. When he jumped up, the golden black sword roared along his shoulder. Although he was forced to avoid it, he still opened a wound. When the blood overflowed, the ghost tooth did not care about the sharp pain. The big flag in his hand was waved violently, his scalp was distributed, and the blood in his eyes was exposed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Second seal, open!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten ghosts At night He waved the big flag of green wood in his hand, and immediately from the banner, there was a thrilling roar. Suddenly, two ghost hands full of scales were stretched out in the banner cloth, and they tore them out fiercely. A ferocious ghost with a single horn was drilled out. Behind it, there was a fierce ghost with green skin all over his body, who was also going to drill out with a grin.</p>
<p>Even the sky, at the moment, seems to be dark down, a dark cloud covered the sun, so that the light of the battle platform is dim, like night.</p>
<p>A head of fierce ghost, suddenly appeared from the flag, a total of ten, each of them burst out the power of condensing gas, and went straight to Bai Xiaochun. Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s face changed, and he was terrified. No matter how fierce he was, he couldn&rsquo;t face ten fierce ghosts with great full power at the same time.</p>
<p>Ghost tooth is also relieved at the moment, his second seal can not be opened for a long time. Seeing the ten ghosts appear at the moment, he knows that he will win this time.</p>
<p>At the moment, in the rear of ten ghosts, he looked at Bai Xiaochun coldly, revealing the essence in his eyes.</p>
<p>The two fought like a dragon and a tiger. The people around him kept exclaiming. At the moment, they could see that the ghost teeth were powerful. The north bank was excited and the south bank was anxious.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s body keeps retreating. The ten ghosts are entangled. Each of them has a strong cultivation. Even if he is blocked by Jinwu sword, he can&rsquo;t get rid of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten ghosts walking at night&hellip;&rdquo; At the critical moment, Bai Xiaochun suddenly looked up at the sky covering the battle platform, which made it look like the dark clouds in the night. Suddenly, her eyes flashed, and her right hand pinched a finger. At once, the golden and black sword went straight to the clouds in the sky, as if to blow away the cloud and make the battle platform no longer dark.</p>
<p>Ghost teeth frown, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s reaction speed is very fast, although his magic power is strong, but the best display state is in the night, the night will not be flawed, if in the day Unless it is to the realm of ghosts covering the sky, otherwise, there will be flaws.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This cloud is not ordinary. Only the treasure of alchemy can be restrained, and it will be absorbed in it. Even if Bai Xiaochun finds a flaw, he can&rsquo;t open it with his strength.&rdquo; Ghost teeth sneer at the bottom of their heart.</p>
<p>At this time, the roar came out. The Jinwu sword flew directly into the cloud. The light flashed, making the cloud thinner. But the cloud was so strange that it was absorbed in it and could not continue to destroy it.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun is in a hurry. When she retreats, she takes out a flying sword which is used to refine spirit twice. She controls and throws it, and runs straight to the clouds and fog. With a bang, the cloud becomes thinner, but it is still absorbed.</p>
<p>But ghost tooth there, is to see a Leng.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another treasure of alchemy&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, before the ghost teeth could react, Bai Xiaochun found that they were actually useful. So he took out seven or eight flying swords in one breath, and all of them ran straight to the sky. Among them, there were four flying swords. At the moment, there was silver light shining on them. All of them were soul refining twice. When they all poured into the clouds, none of them were effective. However, the four spirit refining swords made the clouds roar, thinner and even sunny Scattered, so that the ten sharp ghost issued a sad voice, quickly avoid.</p>
<p>The eyes of the ghost teeth are going to stare out, and they all scream out with his determination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This so many!! Damn it, that&rsquo;s all he&rsquo;s got</p>
<p>Not only is he like this here, but the disciples from both sides of the north and the south open their eyes and can&rsquo;t believe it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God, how can Bai Xiaochun have so many things to refine spirit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard for any disciple to get one, but he There are so many! Who made it for him</p>
<p>When the crowd exclaimed, Zhang daphou was also among the people on the south bank, but he was relatively backward. When he cheered for Bai Xiaochun before, he was not noticed because of too many people.</p>
<p>But at the moment, when he saw those flying swords of Bai Xiaochun, he immediately raised his head, looked proud, and felt more proud in the bottom of his heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are all made by me</p>
<p>When ghost tooth thought that Bai Xiaochun had no alchemy any more, Bai Xiaochun was pleasantly surprised and found that the alchemy could restrain the clouds and fog and burst into laughter.</p>
<p>However, he took out two flying swords. The silver light flashed, and it was still a spirit refining thing and went straight to the clouds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; The ghost tooth fell into a fright.</p>
<p>At this moment, the clouds and fog in the sky were bombarded by eight spirit refining flying swords. They could not bear it any more. They broke up directly, making the sun fall. The ten fierce ghosts screamed and retreated back to the flag. They did not dare to appear.</p>
<p>At the same time, Bai Xiaochun laughs, his body suddenly rushes out, straight to the ghost tooth, the silver light shining on both fingers, and the broken lock agglomerates.</p>
<p>The ghost tooth&rsquo;s face was so ugly that he was about to fight back. Suddenly, a mouthful of blood gushed out and his body trembled. The sequelae of opening the second seal appeared. His eyes showed that he was unwilling and his body quickly retreated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give up!&rdquo; He gritted his teeth and opened his mouth. He knew that his current state was not Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s opponent. However, at that moment, if Bai Xiaochun did not have so many alchemy treasures, the winner must be himself.</p>
<p>Or now it&rsquo;s night, then he can win!</p>
<p>At the moment when he admitted defeat, people on the south bank were shocked and cheered by countless people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Win, we win on the south bank!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha ha, the first one is ours. We have two in the first three!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shame before snow, uncle Bai is invincible!&rdquo; The south bank cheered and startled the sky, while the people on the north bank were bitter and silent. They also saw that it was not the ghost teeth that were not strong, but Bai Xiaochun There are too many treasures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bai Xiaochun, why are there so many treasures of your soul refining?&rdquo; Ghost teeth staring at Bai Xiaochun, he wants to know why he lost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My senior brother Zhang daphou is a thousand years old No, it&rsquo;s a rare alchemy genius. My baby, he made it for me. To blame, it&rsquo;s because you don&rsquo;t have an elder martial brother with a talent. &quot; When Bai Xiaochun spoke with pride, people on the south bank immediately exclaimed, especially at ziding mountain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zhang daphou? Who is such a god man</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zhang daphou, he He&rsquo;s from ziding mountain</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is the disciple of the master Oh, my God, he&rsquo;s usually very low-key. I didn&rsquo;t expect to be so powerful! &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang daphun was excited. He jumped up and yelled at the sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Zhang daphou!! All the flying swords of Bai Xiaochun are made by me He was very excited, roared the biggest voice, spread around, even the leader on the terrace and others, also curiously looked at the past.</p>
<p>When the crowd was shocked, Bai Xiaochun blinked, lifted her chin, swung her sleeve, and turned to the stage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, life is lonely. I&rsquo;m Bai Xiaochun. Tianjiao fights all Tianjiao, and it&rsquo;s all gone&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>。</p>
