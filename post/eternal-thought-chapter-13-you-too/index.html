<p>The fight between the supervisor&rsquo;s office and the fire stove room has lasted for many years, and there are many frictions between them. However, they all have a good grasp of the yardstick. They will not let things go too far. At most, they are just injured.</p>
<p>Now, the fight caused by the road of trial lasted for a long time. Under the punches and kicks of Zhang daphou and others, Chen Fei and others in the supervisor&rsquo;s office were black and blue. They had to take out some spirit stones to compensate the gate. Then they put down their cruel words and left with resentment.</p>
<p>Before leaving, Chen Fei looks back at Bai Xiaochun, who is standing on the fence wall and pretends to be deep. He finds that since Bai Xiaochun arrived at the fire kitchen, the fire kitchen has become more and more hateful.</p>
<p>This fight also attracted the attention of the whole mixed service area. When many of the servants on the south bank found that the supervisor&rsquo;s room had no choice but to the fire kitchen room, they were all indignant. However, some of them, like Hou Xiaomei, felt that the behavior of huozaofang was a good opportunity for them.</p>
<p>Until the next month, the road of trial was opened again, and the people in the early fire kitchen ran away, holding their heads high and guarding the entrance of the test road.</p>
<p>The servants around him glared at them one by one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fellow students, if you climb faster than us, naturally you don&rsquo;t need to buy our quota. We do this for the sake of the clan. In order to make everyone competitive, we can choose the best from the best!&rdquo; Zhang daphou coughed dry and opened his mouth to the servants around him. Bai Xiaochun told him this. At the moment, he said it, and all the servants gnawed their teeth one after another.</p>
<p>As soon as the bell rang and the road of trial was opened, all the people in the fire kitchen room and all the servants rushed away with their lives, as if they had made enough efforts to compete with the fire kitchen.</p>
<p>But soon, they looked at the kitchen fire, the fat man and the figure of Bai Xiaochun disappeared at the end of their eyes, one by one suddenly wry smile, but they were reluctant to move on.</p>
<p>In this way, it is more or less in line with Zhang&rsquo;s words</p>
<p>After another success, the people in the fire kitchen room were so powerful that they made a thorough stir in the miscellaneous service area, which made countless workers almost change their color. However, they had profound cultivation and amazing body shape, which made people dare to be angry and speechless.</p>
<p>This kind of scenery has not been found in huozaofang for so many years. Although the former huozaofang had a great reputation in the miscellaneous service area, now it is the peak in the history of huozaofang.</p>
<p>After that, for the next two months, as long as the road of trial was opened, the people in the fire kitchen room would be in high spirits and gallop away. In their view, this day of each month was the day of the spirit stone.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun is as excited as here. Seeing that there are more and more spirit stones, and the amount of herbs needed to buy is about to be saved, the road of another trial is opened.</p>
<p>In the early morning of this day, Zhang daphou, heisanpang and other fat brothers got up early. Together with Bai Xiaochun, nine of them ran away. Three or three scattered on the road, and Bai Xiaochun went straight to Xiangyun mountain.</p>
<p>But on the way, the supervisor&rsquo;s room suddenly appeared, and could not help but find a reason at random, and fought with Bai Xiaochun. The number of the other side was so large that it took a long time. Until the bell rang, Zhang daphou was in a hurry and his eyes were red.</p>
<p>At this time, all the members of the supervisor&rsquo;s room were in a hurry. Zhang daphou stomped his feet and had no time to pursue him. They rushed to Xiangyun mountain with Bai Xiaochun and Heisan Pang. When they got there, they saw that there were not many people around. They were in a hurry and rushed up the mountain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those bastards in the supervisor&rsquo;s room, I&rsquo;ll go down the mountain later and call all our junior brothers from the fire stove to smash the supervisor&rsquo;s room!&rdquo; Zhang daphou dressed in coarse, angry voice, full potential burst out when he opened his mouth. The fat in his body was burning violently, and his body was thinned by naked eyes, and his speed increased continuously.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun is also angry at the bottom of his heart. He is only a little short of the spirit stone. At the moment, he bites his teeth hard, and his speed is doubled immediately. Together with Zhang daphou and Heisan Pang, they all surpass the laborers in front of them when they run on the trail.</p>
<p>When they were about to reach the top of the mountain, they suddenly looked ugly, because on the top of the mountain, close to the exit, there were three figures standing there.</p>
<p>When the first person was Chen Fei of the supervisor&rsquo;s office, the two big men behind him also looked like three layers of condensate gas. They stood there and laughed one by one after perceiving the figure of Bai Xiaochun and others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zhang daphou, Bai Xiaochun, you are late! But it doesn&rsquo;t matter. I just have a place here. Do you want it? &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mean, shameless, villain!&rdquo; Zhang daphou&rsquo;s eyes were red and he was gnashing his teeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since it doesn&rsquo;t violate the door rules, you can come to the stove room, as can our supervisor room!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha ha, this business will belong to our supervisor&rsquo;s room in the future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chen Fei&rsquo;s voice came out and fell into the ears of Bai Xiaochun. Zhang daphou was furious. It was obvious that the other party had a premeditation, so someone from the supervisor&rsquo;s office came to stop them.</p>
<p>Zhang daphou roared and was about to fight Chen Fei. When he wanted to come, this fight was inevitable. Moreover, how many times would such things happen in the future? It was like robbing his spirit stone, which made Zhang daphou angry.</p>
<p>Black three fat as angry, but in the moment when they want to make a move, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s eyes turn and suddenly speak in a low voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elder martial brother, run hard and push the three of them up the mountain. We&rsquo;d rather not have the spirit stone this time, but also cut off the way for the supervisor&rsquo;s office to compete with us in the future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as he uttered his words, Zhang Da Pang&rsquo;s eyes suddenly showed ecstasy. He felt that there was too much bad water in Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s stomach. When Yang Tian laughed, his body suddenly burst out, and Hei San Pang&rsquo;s eyes lit up. He laughed and shook his body, side by side with Zhang daphou.</p>
<p>The trail was not very wide. At the moment, Zhang daphou and Hei sanpang were together, and immediately they were like a wall. With the rush out, there were bursts of wind.</p>
<p>The speed is so fast that they go straight to Chen Fei and they are very close.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun screams after Zhang daphou.</p>
<p>Chen Fei three people see this, without hesitation, one after another, but even if they do it again, they are not as red as the frightened boar Zhang daphou and black three fat.</p>
<p>The impact of these two people at the moment, can be said to be startling, crying ghosts and gods, all the way running, directly hit Chen Fei. Chen Fei&rsquo;s body immediately retreated, and then their faces suddenly changed. One by one, their eyes were shocked. At the moment, they already saw the intention of the fire kitchen room, and their scalp exploded.</p>
<p>If in other areas, Chen Fei three people can dodge, also can counter attack, but here, their counterattack not only has no effect, but accelerates the body&rsquo;s retreat.</p>
<p>The more backward they were, the more frightened they were.</p>
<p>You know, they don&rsquo;t want to be outside disciples so soon. Once they go to the outer gate, they are no longer supervisors&rsquo; room, but ordinary disciples. They will lose too much oil and water</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be impulsive Chen Fei&rsquo;s cold sweat appeared on his forehead, and he opened his mouth in a hurry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master, rush, push them up the mountain!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After hearing this, Zhang daphou roared to the sky, and his body suddenly doubled as fast as that of Heisan Pang. They left side by side. When the roar came out, a big man in the supervisor&rsquo;s room behind Chen Fei was the first to be unable to resist. In this narrow area, he was directly knocked out of the steps and landed on the top of the mountain. When he stood there, he wanted to cry without tears.</p>
<p>Almost at the same time when he was knocked out, another servant in the supervisor&rsquo;s room let out a scream. He stepped back and stepped out of the road of trial. After standing on the top of the mountain, he beat his chest and was unwilling to reach the extreme.</p>
<p>The last one is Chen Fei. No matter how he resists, he is finally hit by a bang on the narrow mountain road. His eyes are completely red. When he steps on the top of the mountain, he looks at Zhang daphou and others, showing a light of killing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bai Xiaochun What he hates most is not Zhang daphou, but Bai Xiaochun, who made such a bad move.</p>
<p>At the moment, on the top of the mountain, the two outer disciples who were in charge here watched the scene happen. They coughed with each other and stepped back without speaking.</p>
<p>On the way to the exit, Zhang daphou and Heisan Pang burst out laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodbye, Chen Fei. Ha ha. I&rsquo;ll miss you if I don&rsquo;t see you in the miscellaneous service area. I really envy that you can become a disciple of the outside school.&rdquo; Zhang Da Pang patted his stomach, and the fat raised countless waves.</p>
<p>Chen Fei&rsquo;s three people spit blood, and their murderous hearts are aroused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three elder martial brothers, don&rsquo;t thank you. Congratulations on your leaping to the dragon&rsquo;s gate, becoming the disciples of the outer gate and making a great success. Younger martial brothers envy you very much.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun raised his chin with a proud face.</p>
<p>But in the moment of his proud words, a cold voice suddenly came out from the top of Xiangyun mountain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t envy me. You can come too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The moment the sound fell into Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s ears, his body suddenly trembled. When fear appeared in his eyes, a huge suction suddenly came from the top of the mountain, enveloping Bai Xiaochun. He immediately rolled his body and went straight to the top of the mountain.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun screamed and hugged the trunk of a big tree beside the road to practice. The cry was even more miserable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elder martial brother, help me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This scene is so sudden that Zhang daphou and Hei sanpang haven&rsquo;t reacted. They listen to a click. The tree trunk in Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s arms is directly broken. His body is like a kite with a broken line, which is directly rolled to the top of the mountain. At the same time, a middle-aged man walks out from the top of the mountain, wearing a light blue robe, and his look is not angry and self-confident</p>
