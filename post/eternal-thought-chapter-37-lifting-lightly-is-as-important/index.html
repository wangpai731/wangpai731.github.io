      <p>Ten steles, first!</p>
<p>Lingxi is located in the three mountains on the south bank, which is a complete sensation.</p>
<p>Inside and outside the Wanyao Pavilion, at this moment, the sound was booming and spread all over the world. Many people came to the Wanyao Pavilion quickly, looking at the ten stone tablets all being the first little tortoise, they took a breath one after another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten steles are the first. The little turtle has really done it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The last time I saw the first ten steles in Lingxi sect was a thousand years ago. I didn&rsquo;t expect that I could see this scene in my lifetime!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The crowd was filled with exclamations. Although some people expected this kind of thing, it was still shocking when it really happened. Especially in the last three months, it was almost connected, and a stone tablet was taken every month. This speed made everyone recall that it was impossible to be calm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is this little turtle This is only half a year, he started from the third stone tablet, sweeping all the way, like rolling, achieving a great reputation</p>
<p>&ldquo;His attainments in grass and trees have completely surpassed Zhou Xinqi. Is it possible that in the future, besides Zhou Xinqi, there will be another pharmacist in Xiangyun mountain!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the same time, at the moment when all the ten steles were the first, all the ten steles vibrated for a moment, and bursts of roaring sound came out. After these sounds were combined, bursts of Ding sound came from the top of Xiangyun mountain!</p>
<p>It seems that there is a big wood hitting the medicine cauldron, and the sound of stuffy sound reverberates throughout the Xiangyun mountain, spreading all over the South Bank of Lingxi sect, and there are even bursts of medicinal incense. The invisible diffusion covers all directions, making the clouds and fog of Xiangyun mountain all visible to the naked eye.</p>
<p>At the top of Xiangyun mountain, in a cave, Zhou Changlao was feeding his precious colorful birds with spiritual food. Suddenly, he heard the Ding Ming and his eyes showed surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fragrant cloud Ding Ming?&rdquo; His consciousness suddenly dispersed, and he immediately noticed the change of ten stone tablets in Wanyao Pavilion, and his expression moved and left in the air.</p>
<p>Then, elder sun&rsquo;s figure also appeared, and other foundation building friars were all attracted by Ding Ming and walked out one after another. When they looked, they were all surprised.</p>
<p>The last one to appear was Li Qinghou, who was meditating. When he heard the Ding Ming, his face changed. He went out to have a look, and immediately turned into a Changhong and went straight to Wanyao Pavilion.</p>
<p>With the reverberation of Ding Ming, more and more people were in an uproar. The whole Xiangyun mountain, no matter the outer or inner disciples, was shocked and walked out one by one to look at the direction of Wanyao Pavilion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is The sound of my fragrant cloud tripod</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the Wanyao Pavilion, there are ten steles first, which is unprecedented in a thousand years!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even on the Qingfeng mountain and ziding mountain, he was shocked at this moment. Zhang daphou was drooping his head and was reprimanded by an enchanting and beautiful woman beside him. This woman was the old witch he mentioned when he complained to Bai Xiaochun. At the moment, the woman&rsquo;s look moved when she heard the Ding Ming. When she looked up, Zhang daphou was also stunned and watched in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sound of Xiangyun tripod is heard. Is it that some of the disciples of Xiangyun mountain have reached a perfect level in some kind of assessment?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The same scene also appeared on the Qingfeng mountain. The elders and palm seats of Qingfeng mountain also watched.</p>
<p>Gradually, more and more people came to Xiangyun mountain.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun in the crowd, listening to the uproar of people around him, looking at the ten stone tablets, he rarely joined in the cheering, but a trace of unspeakable emotion rose in his heart. He stood there silently, with a smile on his face. The smile was not complacent or arrogant, but simple and happy.</p>
<p>In more than a year, starting from the first stone tablet, he created a miracle and achieved the first ten steles. These are false names. His greatest harvest is for plants, animals, and the knowledge he needs to master as a spirit boy.</p>
<p>It can be said that he has laid a rare and thick foundation for himself. Looking back on the past year, too many days and nights, he has madly studied plants and animals. Bai Xiaochun is filled with emotion and has some regrets.</p>
<p>Looking at the whole Lingxi sect, no one, even the inner disciples, could be more profound than Bai Xiaochun on the basis of his attainments in vegetation. At this moment, Bai Xiaochun was very satisfied.</p>
<p>Soon, a long rainbow roared from all around, and every figure in the rainbow gave out an amazing fluctuation of cultivation. Zhou Changlao, elder sun Li Qinghou is in it.</p>
<p>They all stare at the ten stone steles and the little tortoise in the first place. Each eye shows a bright light, especially Li Qinghou. When he sees the pattern of the little turtle, he is stunned, and then looks strange. After a moment, he laughs and scans the crowd. When he sees Bai Xiaochun, there is appreciation in his eyes that no one can see.</p>
<p>For a long time, big sleeve swung and left with laughter. He was very happy. At a glance, he guessed that the Little Turtle was Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>After those elders left, the inner disciples gradually became more and more. Looking at the little tortoise, these inner disciples were also shocked. They were all promoted from the outer gate. They knew clearly that the stone tablet of Wanyao Pavilion could only be broken at the outer gate. Therefore, the difficulty is hard to compare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As an outsider disciple, it must be Tianjiao to be able to achieve this level&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hum, as medicine apprentices, we focus on refining miraculous herbs. No matter how high the attainments of plants and trees are, it&rsquo;s useless if we can&rsquo;t make them!&rdquo; Some of these inner disciples praised and some showed disdain. However, they had a deep memory of the little turtle, and even in the bottom of their hearts, they were afraid of it.</p>
<p>After all, although I don&rsquo;t know how the other side will refine medicine in the future, such a solid foundation will make the other party go through too much success after becoming a drug apprentice.</p>
<p>The uproar continued until Zhou Xinqi appeared. Standing on the blue silk and gazing at the little tortoise on the ten stone tablets, all the people slowly quieted down and looked at Zhou Xinqi one by one.</p>
<p>This omni-directional feeling of being suppressed on the ten steles makes Zhou Xinqi&rsquo;s eyes reluctant. In the past, it was her turn to bring this complex feeling to others, but now it&rsquo;s her turn to be here, so that she can only be silent..</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you&hellip;&rdquo; Zhou Xinqi bit her teeth. Although she was unwilling, she had tried several times to make her understand that the mysterious little turtle had reached an incredible level in the attainment of grass and trees. Now she has no confidence to surpass. She has been silent for a long time. For this little turtle, she has firmly remembered it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the grass and trees, you are really better than me. After you become a medicine apprentice, I don&rsquo;t believe you can surpass me forever on the road of refining medicine!&rdquo; Zhou Xinqi took a deep breath and calmed down slowly. She had already participated in the examination and had been promoted to be a medicine apprentice. At the moment, she looked at the stone tablet for the last time, turned around and suddenly left.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is just my first stop on the road to becoming a great pharmacist!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun in the crowd, also finally looked at the ten stone tablets, resolutely turned away.</p>
<p>The sensation of the first ten steles lasted for several months in the following days, and there were still people talking about it, especially when people came to Wanyao Pavilion and saw the little tortoise on the stone tablet, this kind of discussion would intensify.</p>
<p>At the same time, those admirers of Zhou Xinqi are searching all over the mountains and fields. They have the momentum to find out the little turtle at all costs. Especially the young man named Qian, who is extremely angry, also joined in the search.</p>
<p>When he talks about Wuzong&rsquo;s yard, he is in front of and behind the red river.</p>
<p>He was studying the realm of lifting lightly, but he had always studied the method of this realm more than half a year ago, but he could not really integrate into it.</p>
<p>Now that the affairs of Wanyao pavilion are over, Bai Xiaochun sees that Zhou Xinqi&rsquo;s admirers are constantly searching for themselves. With a sense of crisis in her heart, she simply avoids the limelight and begins to put her heart and soul into the light lifting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lifting light is speed, lifting light is heavy It&rsquo;s a method of control! &quot; White small pure eyes show contemplation, this is his feeling in these days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In other words, this kind of control is actually an explosive force of aura in the body!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s eyes twinkled. Now he has six layers of condensation. His aura is like a river. In the realm of lifting heavy weights as light as a light, he has been able to achieve continuous and amazing speed.</p>
<p>There has been a clear understanding that the so-called state is actually the method of using the aura in the body. It is like a leaf that can lift a small piece of wood, but if it is rolled up, it can lift a small stone, but if it is torn into strips and woven together, it can drag heavier objects.</p>
<p>The material is the same, but the way of combination is different, so the strength is different.</p>
<p>And lifting lightly is such a method. Once mastered, it is equivalent to stepping into this realm.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun pondered for a long time, and a leaf came from afar and floated in front of him. Under his constant attempts, the leaf was sometimes fast and sometimes slow, like a mountain pressure.</p>
<p>Ten times if you can&rsquo;t do it once, a hundred times if you can&rsquo;t do it a hundred times Thousands of times.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun didn&rsquo;t know how many times he tried. All the leaves in his yard were broken. So he went out to look for the leaves. At last, he took the leaves of all the non spiritual trees, flowers and plants in Xiangyun mountain. At last, one evening, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s eyes flashed and he pinched a finger. The willow leaf in front of him seemed light and could fall in the moment of falling It&rsquo;s like a rock hitting the ground.</p>
<p>With a bang, the ground of the yard was shocked, as if the willow leaves were heavy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s done!&rdquo; White Xiaochun&rsquo;s eyes were filled with blood, but his expression was exhilarating. He got up and swung his right hand. The small wooden sword flew out and became a black line. In a flash, it was not only faster, but also more powerful than before. Even there was a sharp sound of breaking the air.</p>
<p>In the roar, the huge mountain rock in the distance broke into pieces.</p>
<p>This kind of power is no longer comparable to that of the sixth layer of condensate. Even if the seventh and eighth layers of condensate are seen, they will be shocked and shocked.</p>
