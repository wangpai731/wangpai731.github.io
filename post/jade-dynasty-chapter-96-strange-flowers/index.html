      <p>Dawang village.</p>
<p>Xiaohuan stood at the entrance of the village and looked at him with some worry. He saw only the direction of him. In the morning, there was still a clear sky. Now it was getting dark. It seemed that there would be another heavy rain.</p>
<p>Late last night, she and her grandfather, Zhou Xian and Jin pinger, were in the dead water together. But after Jin pinger went out for a visit, she looked very tired and sent them out of the dead water overnight.</p>
<p>Xiao Huan asked Jin Ping&rsquo;er in private, but Jin Ping&rsquo;er was silent and said: &ldquo;now in the dead water, the situation is far more dangerous than I expected. You will stay here again for fear that it will harm you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan always believed this elder sister&rsquo;s words. That night, she left with Monday Xian. At the same time, according to jinpinger&rsquo;s instructions, she prepared for today and left here. However, it was not a short time for her to know jinpinger. Last night, she saw jinpinger look so dignified for the first time.</p>
<p>She thought about it and couldn&rsquo;t help worrying about her sister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little ring!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a familiar cry from behind. Xiaohuan turned around. As expected, it was Monday Xian who came quickly. He said, &ldquo;everything is ready. Let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan nodded silently, but couldn&rsquo;t help but ask the immortal on Monday, &ldquo;Grandpa, do you think sister piner is in the dead water, will there be any danger?&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Monday, the immortal was stunned for a while and said, &ldquo;how do I know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan took a sip at the corner of his mouth and stared at him. After all, the immortal on Monday still loved the granddaughter, sighed and saw that there was no one left or right. He walked to Xiaohuan and whispered, &ldquo;we have met the disciples of the longevity hall several times with jinpinger in the dead water these days. But since last night, you have seen the disciples of the longevity hall?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan is surprised.</p>
<p>On Monday, the fairy smiled, his face gradually showing a different look from his usual smiley face, his eyes gradually sharpened and bright, and said: &ldquo;especially when you meet the fish head weirdo that day, I can hear it clearly beside you. It&rsquo;s the ghost King sect and the young master of the ten thousand poisons sect, GUI Li and Qin Wuyan, who meet jinpinger. At this time, the three met again within the influence of the general Hall of longevity. What did you say they would do? &quot;</p>
<p>Little ring willow eyebrows wrinkled together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grandpa, do you mean&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Monday, Xianjie said: &ldquo;yes, I&rsquo;m afraid that the longevity hall, which has been a scenic spot for 800 years, will be destroyed by these three young evil stars. How can yuyangzi do it. Actually&hellip; &quot; He sighed for a long time, and then his face suddenly faded. For a long time, he said: &ldquo;now the internal fight of the demon sect is increasingly fierce, but there are also intrigues in the right way. Qingyun gate was greatly damaged ten years ago, but it has not been recovered. In this world, I&rsquo;m afraid we&rsquo;re going to die. &quot;</p>
<p>Xiao Huan was stunned. On Monday, the fairy took a long breath and suddenly refreshed. Haha smiled and said: &ldquo;if the world is going to be chaotic, let him go! What does it have to do with us? Go, we will continue to benefit the people of the world. &quot;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan is dumb, but on Monday, it seems that the fairy didn&rsquo;t care about it at all. He goes to pick up the bundle, and holds the bamboo pole with the root of &ldquo;immortal guiding the way&rdquo;. He looks back to greet Xiaohuan, but suddenly he is stunned and looks behind Xiaohuan.</p>
<p>Seeing Grandpa&rsquo;s strange eyes, Xiao Huan turned to look at them. Can&rsquo;t help but also a stay, only to see the wild dog Taoist face unlucky, a gloomy face from the direction of the dead Ze came over, eyes swept. But I saw Xiaohuan and Monday Xian standing at the entrance of the village.</p>
<p>This morning, the wild dog Taoist, who had been following the spirit, was suddenly ordered by the spirit to leave the dead water immediately. The wild dog was shocked. In fact, he knew that it was dangerous in the dead water and it was good to go. However, the young man was grimacing and said something coldly. He was very unhappy. He scolded and came out angrily along the way.</p>
<p>At this moment, I suddenly met a small ring at the entrance of the village. The wild dog, somehow, leaped in his heart, and unconsciously went around. He didn&rsquo;t know what he was afraid of?</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, without taking two steps, Xiao Huan&rsquo;s voice came from behind: &ldquo;Taoist priest, wait!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wild dog Zheng for a while, slowly turned around, Monday fairy frowned to small ring side, not good gas tunnel: &ldquo;what do you ask him to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohuan stares at the immortal on Monday, but doesn&rsquo;t pay attention to him, smiles on her face, walks over, takes out an umbrella from the baggage around her, and says to the Taoist of the wild dog, &ldquo;Taoist, I haven&rsquo;t returned your umbrella yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wild dog looked at the umbrella for two times. His face was cloudy and clear. For a while, he was in a trance and didn&rsquo;t reach out to take it. Xiao Huan didn&rsquo;t care. He put the umbrella into the hands of the wild dog Taoist and smiled at him, saying, &ldquo;thank you so much that day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wild dog Taoist suddenly felt that his eyes were brightened, as if some of them had been blinded, and he swallowed his mouth secretly.</p>
<p>Xiaohuan went back to the side of Monday fairy, took the burden from Monday fairy, and said: &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go! Grandpa. &quot;</p>
<p>On Monday, the fairy stared at the wild dog standing in the same place, followed Xiaohuan and said, &ldquo;Why are you laughing at him all the time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Huan said angrily, &ldquo;Grandpa, they are good people!&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Monday, the immortal &ldquo;Pooh&rdquo; and said, &ldquo;he is a good man. Am I not the reincarnation of Buddha?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Huan and Zhou Yixian gradually went away, and their voices gradually decreased. The wild dog stood in the same place, holding the umbrella in his hand, motionless, and did not know how long later. Suddenly, he stepped up to Xiao Huan and Zhou Yixian.</p>
<p>After their figures disappeared one by one, peace returned to Dawang village. Standing in a corner a few feet away from the entrance of the village, there was a man and a woman with a long white coat and a black veil. It was Qinglong and Youji.</p>
<p>Green Dragon light way: &ldquo;what is the origin of this Monday, you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hidden behind the black gauze, you Ji did not speak, but saw the black gauze gently shaking, as if shaking her head slightly.</p>
<p>Qinglong pondered for a moment, his eyes seemed to be thoughtful, and then he said: &ldquo;this man is not simple, and his granddaughter actually has contact with the Golden Vase son of the joy sect, so we need to pay more attention in the future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You Ji is silent for a moment, light way: &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go! We can&rsquo;t delay what the patriarch ordered us to do. &quot;</p>
<p>Green Dragon looked at her, eyes flashed a light shade of sadness, but the face was still, said: &ldquo;yes, let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finish saying, he two people slowly walk out of Dawang village, but the direction of the line is opposite to Zhou Yixian and others, going to the death swamp.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know where the wind comes from. It&rsquo;s passing through the heaven and earth. It&rsquo;s faint and bleak.</p>
<p>It seems to be a little dark again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boom!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a thunder in the dark cloud, and the big raindrops of beans immediately fell. Drenched the whole world, a gray, ghost Li stood on the top of a tree, looked around.</p>
<p>Behind us is the huge miasma wall. In fact, according to common sense, once the miasma of common mountain water meets the rain, it tends to converge to silence. However, the miasma in the dead water seems to have no fear of the rain. Despite the wind and rain, it is still towering.</p>
<p>GUI Li slowly turned his head and looked forward, but he saw that in the inner water, the forest was growing unexpectedly. At one glance, he saw that in the bleak wind and rain, the forest also spread infinitely. I don&rsquo;t know how far it is? And the rain is quite big, although the line of sight is much clearer than just in the miasma. But still can&rsquo;t see too far.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Squeak, squeak!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly, the branches around him jumped. It turned out that the ash left just now bounced on the branches and ran back. Two or three times, it jumped back to Gui Li&rsquo;s shoulder. Unexpectedly, he picked some wild fruits from nowhere, grinned and handed them to Gui Li. He covered three or four wild fruits in his hand and chewed them.</p>
<p>The ghost shrieked a smile. Then he took a bite and felt that the entrance was green and astringent, but there was another taste.</p>
<p>At this time, the rain grew louder and the thunder continued. Ghost Li doesn&rsquo;t use magic weapon to resist, let the rain fall on his body, and little ash sits on his shoulder. His hair gets wet gradually, but it seems that he doesn&rsquo;t care much, just about the fruit at the mouth. &ldquo;Kajikaji&rdquo; is having a good time. An old tail is stretched out behind the ghost. It&rsquo;s interesting to look at it.</p>
<p>The ghost Li slowly ate the wild fruit in his hand, and suddenly said softly, &ldquo;little ash, did you recognize her just now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little ash thought that he was chewing wild fruit, mumbled vaguely, and a pair of monkey eyes peered at the ghost.</p>
<p>GUI Li didn&rsquo;t seem to think about the answer from the monkey, just said: &ldquo;why didn&rsquo;t she kill me? Isn&rsquo;t she the one who hates the devil cult the most? &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boom!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little ash didn&rsquo;t answer, but there was a thunder in the sky.</p>
<p>Ghost Li slowly looked up at the sky, rain all over the sky, like a knife like a sword, into thousands of, pour down</p>
<p>His body quivered slightly, and suddenly his mind flew, as if he had returned to the night of his youth. He was outside the village with the kind-hearted old monk, and he spoke to himself in a calm voice.</p>
<p>This scene was engraved in his deep heart, which had not been forgotten for many years.</p>
<p>His hands were clenched, his nails were deep in his hands, and even his body began to tremble with excitement. At the moment, the soul devouring nestled in his sleeve, as usual, almost brightened at the same time. The familiar cold feeling swam all over his body, and the fierce Qi on the blood bead seemed to gather in his eyes.</p>
<p>Little ash was on his shoulder and gave an uneasy cry.</p>
<p>In the sky, a flash of lightning pierced the sky. There was a fierce howl. The whole body was red in the middle of the sky. The right arm stretched out, and the soul had already reached the hand. Only the dark blue light condensed into a huge light in the rain, and then it was cut off.</p>
<p>At the moment, his eyes were full of blood and red light, full of murderous face, twisted face, low roar in his mouth, like a beast.</p>
<p>The huge green mans split. The big tree that was standing just now was split into two parts by him, and then collapsed on both sides.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>There was another thunder in the sky.</p>
<p>Little ash jumped aside and looked at him in silence.</p>
<p>He knelt on one leg in the filthy soil soaked in the rain. His right hand tightly grasped the soul, his whole body trembled, his eyes flashed, but his face was full of pain.</p>
<p>Who knows, the pain of his downfall</p>
<p>A peaceful atmosphere of Zhengyang rose in his body.</p>
<p>On the clothes wetted by the rain, at the right arm, suddenly there was a round shimmer. The pure and harmonious Qi of Zhengyang was uploaded from the &ldquo;xuanhuojian&rdquo; tied to his right arm, and then entered the body, gradually holding the fierce Qi of the blood bead.</p>
<p>For a long time, the blood red light in his eyes gradually disappeared, and his face became peaceful. In contrast, the magic weapon light emitted by soul devouring and xuanhuojian was gradually weak and disappeared.</p>
<p>As if he had experienced a great war, he got up slowly and looked tired. In the past ten years, he has been practising the magic heavenly script day and night, and the blood eating bead is naturally fierce. I don&rsquo;t know how many times he has been controlled by the blood eating bead evil Qi as dangerous as he is today. However, after all, there are still Taiji Xuanqing Dao and Dafan Prajna in his body, both of which are the supreme Dharma, which can barely resist.</p>
<p>But most of all, every time when his mind can be broken. Xuanhuojian, another mysterious magic weapon on his body, will always send out a magic and pure Yang Qi, which will pull him back from the road of complete destruction and killing.</p>
<p>Just. He didn&rsquo;t know how many days he could resist the blood bead eaten by the natural demon, and for him, whenever he thought of the past, he thought of Bagao. That kind of torture is really painful. If it wasn&rsquo;t for his fortitude, he would have gone mad.</p>
<p>But these things, however, are as shrewd as the king of ghosts, and they never realize that the most powerful people under their control are on the edge of madness day and night.</p>
<p>He slowly stood up and opened his mouth. Only then did he realize that his voice was hoarse: &ldquo;Xiaohui. Let&rsquo;s go! &quot;</p>
<p>Little gray blinked, jumped back obediently, and jumped on his shoulder two or three times.</p>
<p>Ghost Li gently stroked the little gray hair and moved his lips, but after all, he didn&rsquo;t say anything. He inhaled deeply, stepped forward, and walked to the deep forest ahead.</p>
<p>In the swamp of death, which is shrouded in rain, except for the sound of wind and rain. Heaven and earth seemed to hear nothing. There was a silence in the old and dense forest. The rain hit the branches and leaves, and the water drops fell.</p>
<p>horizon. Another thunder!</p>
<p>It rained for half an hour, but it didn&rsquo;t stop.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu wiped his face and wiped off the water drops on his face, but within a moment, another piece of rain came down. He gave up his efforts with a wry smile.</p>
<p>He was in the middle of an old forest. He is the only one around. It&rsquo;s really a sense of inexplicable fear to be alone in this wild and dangerous and strange place.</p>
<p>Originally, Qingyun gate, together with a group of outstanding young experts from Zhengdao Tianyin temple and burning incense Valley, entered neizeli. But when crossing the miasma wall, the first thing happened suddenly. The strange storm eye in the middle made people&rsquo;s feet in a mess. Before they could be stabilized, a huge monster appeared in the miasma, and passed through them.</p>
<p>Because of the miasma, no one could see the monster&rsquo;s appearance clearly, and the monster seemed to pass by without any action to hurt them. But the body was too large. Although everyone had a very high way of life, everyone was scared and flew away in the crisis. In addition, in the miasma storm, they were so separated.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu flies all the way. With the help of &ldquo;dragon cutting sword&rdquo;, he rushes out of the miasma and comes to this ancient neize forest. And he rushed out of the position, in fact, from where the ghost, but just a few tens of miles.</p>
<p>These two childhood friends, who used to be like brothers, are not aware of this situation at the moment. Just, even if they know, what they are facing is a more painful scene instead of fear?</p>
<p>Naturally, Lin Jingyu didn&rsquo;t know all this. He looked up at the sky and saw that the dark clouds were still thick. It seemed that the rain was going to last for a long time. He could not help swearing a few words in his mouth, pondering for a moment, and finally walked forward.</p>
<p>In fact, there is no way to walk through the forest. In addition to the tall trees, the forest is also full of dense and luxuriant brambles and shrubs, all kinds of strange flowers and plants. In the world beyond the dead water, there have never been any other animals and poisonous insects, which appear in front of the forest from time to time.</p>
<p>Only after a while, Lin Jingyu has been in danger for several times. If it wasn&rsquo;t for his intelligence and alertness, the cultivation of Taoism has increased a lot in the past ten years, and the danger will suffer a lot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Woo!&rdquo; At the same time, Lin Jingyu couldn&rsquo;t stand it any longer. He immediately rose up in the air and rose up in the air with the power of magic weapon.</p>
<p>When he was in the middle of the sky, he was a little relieved. At the same time, he was surprised. In the inner part of the water, he was really shocked one step at a time. The danger was far better than that of the outer part. I don&rsquo;t know where so many different poisonous insects came from?</p>
<p>He took a look underground. The body of the red Viper was still struggling and twisted on the ground. It seemed as if it was not dead. Besides the viper, he had just been attacked by scorpion, toad and alien lizard. It was really dangerous.</p>
<p>Originally, Lin Jingyu thought that he didn&rsquo;t need to waste his physical strength, so he walked up a section of the ground, but now he dare not land easily. He looked around in the mid air, and suddenly he was shocked.</p>
<p>In front of us, deep in the forest, behind the rain, suddenly a golden light flashed, mingled with the wind and rain, and there was a murmur of rebuke.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu&rsquo;s heart is happy, not to hesitate. Hastily urged the magic weapon to fly to the place where the golden light flashed.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s such a magic weapon to fly in the sky. How fast is it? It won&rsquo;t take a moment. Then he flew to the nearest place and looked at it. He couldn&rsquo;t help but be surprised. He saw that there was a strange vacant space in the forest, but there was a puddle in the middle. Unexpectedly, there is a strange flower in full bloom.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a huge flower with a diameter of several hundred meters. If you don&rsquo;t see it with your own eyes, it&rsquo;s hard to believe that there are such different species in the world.</p>
<p>Seen from the air, the lower part of the flower is cyan, but the upper part is divided into numerous branches, which are red and colorful. The red and green colors in the middle are very clearly distinguished, which clearly shows a separation line. But at the end of those red branches at the top, there are little balls like dewdrops.</p>
<p>The water on the top is drenched, and I don&rsquo;t know if it is rain drenched, or is it the same?</p>
<p>In the wind and rain, the flowers tremble gently with the wind, and a faint sweet fragrance spreads in the wind.</p>
<p>Lin was shocked, and then he was attracted by the two people and one beast beside the flower. At a glance, he saw a happy face. Only two people standing in the scene were Zeng Shushu, who came back from the same school. And the Dharma phase of Tianyin temple.</p>
<p>When meeting acquaintances in this strange place, Lin Jingyu was so happy that he couldn&rsquo;t help crying out.</p>
<p>Both of them were shocked when they heard the call. Turning around, Lin Jingyu rushes down. It&rsquo;s great joy. But a moment later, he was instructed to look forward. Lin Jingyu is calm. Suddenly I was scared by the monster in front of me.</p>
<p>Originally, the monster that confronts with FA Xiang and Zeng Shushu was also extremely strange. But first, Lin Jingyu was shocked by the huge flower in front of them in the mid air. Second, he saw that they were too happy to notice the monster in front of him. At the moment, I can see that the monster looks like a duck. There is a tall man with blue body, light red eyes, red tail, tusks in his mouth and wings on his back. It looks like a ferocious bird.</p>
<p>At the moment, however, he saw the monster roaring and his wings shaking. Suddenly, a gust of wind mixed with rain came to him.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu falls beside Zeng Shushu and FA Xiang. The three of them are leaning back on Qihua. Lin Jingyu frowns and steps back.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, FA Xiang&rsquo;s face suddenly changed color. He stretched out his hand to hold Lin Jingyu and whispered, &ldquo;never get close to that flower!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu was shocked and stopped, but he looked at FA Xiang. The smile on his face suddenly became cold, and he lightly blocked his hand away.</p>
<p>With a frown and a sigh, FA Xiang shrinks his hand back. After all, Lin Jingyu still remembers the tragedy in Caomiao village. He can&rsquo;t let it go.</p>
<p>At the moment, Zeng Shushu raised his voice abruptly and called out, &ldquo;be careful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were shocked. Looking forward, they saw that the monster&rsquo;s wings vibrated, leaped into the air and rushed over.</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu said in a hurry, &ldquo;elder martial brother Faxiang, we will act according to plan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu was going to make a move, but when he said that, he was stunned and stopped.</p>
<p>I saw that the monster came to me with a strong and fast momentum. In a flash, it was in front of me. At the same time, fasang and zengshu drank in a low voice and spread to both sides. The monster looked fierce, but it seemed to have a weak mind. At that time, I was still in the same place for a while. It seemed that I didn&rsquo;t know which enemy I was going to pursue. But in this moment, the &ldquo;samsara bead&rdquo; of fasang and the &ldquo;Xuanyuan&rdquo; of zengshu Sword &ldquo;and hit it from the side.</p>
<p>The monster was not afraid at all. He opened his mouth and roared, &ldquo;bang&rdquo; twice. These two magic weapons hit the monster and beat it back to fly out. However, it looked like the monster in the air was not damaged at all. Lin Jingyu could not help changing his color in this endurance. He changed it to himself, even though he might not be able to take the full blow from Zeng Shushu and FA Xiang.</p>
<p>Seeing the monster shaking its wings, once it has stabilized its body, it will fight back fiercely. Lin Jingyu is on guard, but at this moment, his whole body is shaking and his mouth is slightly open, unable to speak.</p>
<p>The monster flew back and there was nothing behind it. It was the huge flower. The monster&rsquo;s body was flying, and it ran into the red and crystal branches above the flower. Suddenly, the monster roared, but the voice was full of fear.</p>
<p>In a moment, the strange flower has made an incredible change. All the flowers suddenly come alive. From all directions, they swarm around the monster&rsquo;s place. The red crystal ball on the flower branch seems to have strong adhesion. The monster sticks to the top. Although struggling hard, it can&rsquo;t break free. In a moment, more and more petals are sticking layer by layer Surrounded up, finally wrapped up the monster who came to the high place. Even the roar of the monster gradually sank down.</p>
<p>The FA Xiang and Zeng Shushu, who set this trap, saw that the strange flower was so terrible at the moment. They could not help but change their faces like Lin Jingyu.</p>
<p>For a long time, the strange flower finally wrapped the monster completely, and could not see the shadow of the monster any more. Suddenly, the scene returned to peace, and only the wind and rain were left between the heaven and earth.</p>
<p>The three men looked at each other, sighed at each other, stood upright with one palm, and chanted Buddha in a soft voice.</p>
<p>Note 1: &ldquo;the spirit and the spirit of different herbs&rdquo; devour human flowers: wild and heterogeneous, the flowers bloom more than ten feet, red on the top and white on the bottom, with red beads on the top, and living creatures adhere to devour them.</p>
<p>Note: in the &ldquo;Encyclopedia of modern insectivorous plants&rdquo;, it is suspected to be a &ldquo;nutria&rdquo; organism. It is distributed in South America and Asia, but it is not large in size and insectivorous, which does no great harm to human beings.</p>
<p>Its appearance is similar to that of ancient books. It may be aquatic nutria or felt moss.</p>
<p>Note 2: this book shows &ldquo;the book of mountains and seas, the book of mountains, the book of mountains, the book of mountains, the book of mountains, the book of mountains, the book of mountains, the book of mountains, the book of mountains, the book of mountains, the book of mountains, the book of mountains, the book of mountains.
