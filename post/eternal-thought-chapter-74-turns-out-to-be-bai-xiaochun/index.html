<p>Elder Zhou&rsquo;s voice spread all over Xiangyun mountain and reverberated everywhere. After hearing this, countless disciples looked strange. What happened in Xiangyun mountain that day shocked everyone</p>
<p>The other elders of Xiangyun mountain are also shocking. However, the Phoenix is the favorite of Zhou Changlao, and it is inconvenient for other people to stop it by force. In case of injuring the crazy Phoenix bird, it will cause Zhou Changlao&rsquo;s displeasure.</p>
<p>The most important thing is In the whole Xiangyun mountain, there is only one old bird keeper, so no matter what you say, it&rsquo;s always Zhou&rsquo;s own business. It&rsquo;s not easy for outsiders to interfere.</p>
<p>As for Lingwei chicken Li Qinghou went out. Zhou Xinqi, as a disciple, was powerless to manage. Especially the male Phoenix was too strong. When she looked from a distance in the daytime, she was blushing with shame. How dare she go forward.</p>
<p>At the moment, Zhou Changlao&rsquo;s body was shaking uncontrollably. He looked at the Phoenix that was still crying and crying, and looked around at the dispirited birds around him. He wanted to cry without tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will find out who did this job in the end!&rdquo; With Zhou Changlao&rsquo;s attainments in medicine, he saw at a glance that his Phoenix had been drugged.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun hides in the room of the medicine refining Pavilion. Although the sound is isolated from the outside world to the greatest extent, the angry Zhou Changlao has a strong penetrating power. Even here, Bai Xiaochun can hear it faintly.</p>
<p>His heart trembled and his face showed injustice. He really felt wronged</p>
<p>At present, we can only hope that this matter is perfect. Elder Zhou can&rsquo;t find himself Bai Xiaochun frowned, but in her mind, she was thinking about refining the pill to make it more effective.</p>
<p>After studying for several days, he went out several times to purchase the herbs he needed. He also exchanged his contribution points for some things that were hard to buy outside, and kept trying in the medicine refining Pavilion.</p>
<p>In a sense, it was the first time for Bai Xiaochun to create a complete prescription. At the beginning, although he had a clear understanding, it was a slight change. [love to go to the small</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like now. It&rsquo;s so difficult to create completely out of thin air. If Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s medicine attainments were changed when he was promoted to be a pharmacist, he would not be able to do this. But now he has been studying medicine for more than a year, he can make a little attempt.</p>
<p>Although he was still astringent, the road he was taking was not what other pharmacists thought, but the one that pharmacists would explore.</p>
<p>In a flash of time, half a month later, Bai Xiaochun was immersed in the creation of prescriptions in the medicine refining Pavilion, and had some thoughts after constantly trying.</p>
<p>Just as he opened the stove again, Xiangyun mountain top, his old face showed heartache. He took a pill of pills and fed it to a withered Phoenix in front of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peace of mind and self-cultivation, all the things you have done before are not your wish, it is not your fault. When you are good, take me to find the person who gave you the medicine. No matter who it is, I will let this person pay the price!&rdquo; Elder Zhou&rsquo;s expression showed a fierce intention. In the past half month, he investigated the whole Xiangyun mountain, and even other peaks on the south bank.</p>
<p>But there is no trace, the only way is to wait for the bird to cultivate for a period of time, personally take him to look for it.</p>
<p>At the same time, he also found that in the past half month, the whole Xiangyun mountain There is no winged bird. It seems that this place has become a forbidden area for all birds since the tragedy happened half a month ago</p>
<p>It seems that in the middle of the sky, all the birds emit amazing breath, which makes the birds smell pale. How dare they come? Even those Lingwei chickens are shaking and losing their spirits all day long. The disciples who raise them are all crying and crying.</p>
<p>Gradually, after the fermentation, a series of rumors appeared in Xiangyun mountain</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember that bird half a month ago? I heard a news that the bird had taken the medicine of its circumference to become so I don&rsquo;t know why elder Zhou is so old to make this medicine&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shh Keep your voice down. Do you know why Zhou Chang likes those birds There is a terrible secret in this. Zhou Changlao has no Taoist partners in his life. Cough You know. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my God. Are those birds crazy because they can&rsquo;t bear the long-term torture of their perimeter!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The news became more and more exaggerated. At the end of the day, most of the disciples of Xiangyun mountain heard about it, and everyone could not help but fantasize about it. After the news finally spread, all kinds of legends appeared.</p>
<p>When elder Zhou heard about this, he was so angry that he almost burst out blood and wanted to explain it. But everyone saw him, his face changed obviously. No matter how he opened his mouth, it didn&rsquo;t seem to help. Even though he bowed his head in awe, there were more rumors in secret</p>
<p>It was half a month later. On this day, elder Zhou&rsquo;s whole body was full of evil spirit, and his face was more ferocious than ever. With a wave of his right hand, the male Phoenix, which had been recuperated for a month, suddenly flew out. Its body was still strong, and its breath was even stronger. It was obviously a blessing in disguise</p>
<p>Originally, elder Zhou felt a little better when he saw this scene, but he was not very happy in his heart. When he thought of this month, countless disciples in the sect were afraid when they saw him, and the strange appearance of his peers coughing in front of him, especially those rumors, which made elder Zhou&rsquo;s seven tips smoke, and he immediately flew out with a Phoenix.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go and find me the man who gave you the medicine!&rdquo; Elder Zhou gnawed his teeth.</p>
<p>The Phoenix made a song and flew forward rapidly in mid air. Elder Zhou followed him, and his whole body became more and more evil. It attracted the attention of many disciples of Xiangyun mountain, and even some good disciples followed him from afar.</p>
<p>Soon, the male bird went straight to Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s residence. When he arrived, he wandered in the middle of the house. Looking at elder Zhou, he saw his grievances and hissed. It seemed to tell elder Zhou that it was here that he was drugged.</p>
<p>This scene was immediately seen by those disciples who came around. They opened their eyes one by one and were stunned. When they realized who was the cave, they all blinked one by one, and their looks were even more strange.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here It seems to be uncle Bai&rsquo;s house. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really uncle Bai&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cough, if someone else does this, I don&rsquo;t believe it, but if it&rsquo;s uncle Bai It&rsquo;s reasonable! &quot;</p>
<p>Zhou Changlao stood in the air, shivering all over his body, his eyes were red, and he bit his teeth fiercely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bai Xiaochun He finally found the culprit. At the moment, after he realized that there was no one in the house, he waved his right hand and took out the jade slips to trace them with his own rights.</p>
<p>Soon, he found out that Bai Xiaochun was in the medicine refining Pavilion.</p>
<p>At the moment, a grim smile appears on his face. What a gentle person Zhou is in his daily life. At the moment, with the Phoenix in his roar, he goes straight to the medicine refining Pavilion. All the disciples of Xiangyun mountain are excited one by one, and quickly summon their friends to spread the news to the whole Xiangyun mountain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, the man behind that bird&rsquo;s madness. Here we are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle Bai did it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After hearing the news, countless disciples from other schools and even some inner ones were shocked and excited and rushed out.</p>
<p>At the beginning, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s torment turned into passion. The greater the pain, the more intense the passion. Chen Ziang rushed out in an instant, showing interest on his face. Zhao Yiduo also ran quickly. They looked at each other, and they all put down their disagreements. At the moment, they all wanted to see Bai Xiaochun suffer.</p>
<p>In the crowd, a big man shed tears. He was Liu Er Gou, who called himself the Lord wolf. At the moment, he wanted to raise his voice and shout: &ldquo;retribution!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the same time that the whole Xiangyun mountain was moving out, Bai Xiaochun looked as excited as he was in the medicine refining Pavilion. He looked at the furnace in front of him. At the moment, the furnace vibrated, and a strong aroma spread. Several white pills appeared in the furnace.</p>
<p>This pill has no name and can&rsquo;t be swallowed. If you touch it with a little force, it will break into fly ash. It has only one effect For male fierce animals, it can induce impulse. Confused.</p>
<p>Among them, Bai Xiaochun used dozens of herbs that can produce stimulation, and even bought some spirit animal materials from the north bank at any cost. It took a long time for Bai Xiaochun to refine them successfully.</p>
<p>As for the effect, he was not very clear, but he had some conjectures in his mind that it would not be too bad. Even in order to worry about the bad effect, he added several times more, and even every bamboo herb was refined by him.</p>
<p>At the moment, Bai Xiaochun with expectations, looking at the hands of these white elixir, the imagination of this Dan medicine and hair Qing Dan after the scene, the mouth can not help but a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s called female fragrant pill. It&rsquo;s a good name. The former red pill is called hair. Love pill After thinking about it, Bai Xiaochun simply refined the pills three times.</p>
<p>In this way, this pill is not the same immediately, it is no longer inferior, but has reached the best quality!!</p>
<p>Its efficacy Bai Xiaochun imagined for a moment, her eyes were brighter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hum, no matter what fierce beast, when I see Bai Xiaochun in the future, I will let it pounce on it wherever I let it go!&rdquo; With a dry cough, Bai Xiaochun put away the pills and was satisfied. She was about to go out for a walk, but she just walked out of the medicine refining Pavilion.</p>
<p>Just then</p>
<p>A roar came clearly from the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bai Xiaochun!&rdquo;</p>
<hr>
<p>Bai Xiaochun looked at the recommendation list stupidly, and her heart trembled: &ldquo;recommendation urgent ah, friends of the road, my great pharmacist Bai Xiaochun, use hair. Dan, change the ticket</p>
