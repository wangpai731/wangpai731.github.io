      <p>The red light of blood covered the sky and floated over the sky. Looking at the sky peak, the whole sky curtain turned red, and the dark red clouds rolled and tossed, which made people feel breathless. Under this red cloud, everything is dyed red. The sky is red, the mountains are red, the clouds on the sea of clouds are red, and the water drops on the Hongqiao bridge are red, even as if the cold mountain wind is blowing, as if it were red.</p>
<p>Thick bloody gas, blowing from the wind, diffused in the Tongtian peak.</p>
<p>Countless figures are climbing up from all directions under the Tongtian peak. There are almost no gaps. There are human figures everywhere. Everyone&rsquo;s eyes are shining with strange red light. Looking at these crazy people, most of them are ordinary people living at the foot of Qingyun Mountain in terms of their clothes. However, how can ordinary people act like this and climb like apes? The strangeness of these people is naturally in the strange blood that takes away their minds.</p>
<p>It takes no effort to have numerous armies. Even if the confused ordinary people can be inspired to have ten times their life potential through the four spirits blood array, there is really no way to solve the evil cult ghost king. A crazy ordinary people, any one in Qingyun gate, can ignore it, but there are a hundred thousand people, what&rsquo;s more, there are hundreds of thousands of people rushing up the mountain like a group of crazy ants, which makes people feel cold.</p>
<p>Among the numerous crazy people, there are still a large number of people who are particularly active under the light of the blood in the sky. Their Daoism is far better than those ordinary people who are like mole ants around. They can fly and control swords. They can do all that Taoist practitioners can do. Moreover, their Taoism is extremely high. There are many disciples of Qingyun gate who have surpassed the guards. Naturally, these people had been destroyed by the ghost king in the previous several battles.</p>
<p>With the help of many experts, together with an almost endless tide of crazy people, the attack of the demon sect is like a huge wave, which is irresistible. Under the red light, the Qingyun gate disciples who defend in the cloud sea have been defeated and retreated to Hongqiao one after another without any decent resistance.</p>
<p>Before long, the sound of &ldquo;whoosh&rdquo; was heard all the time. The army of demon cult coming from all directions had occupied the huge open platform of cloud sea. Looking at the originally misty fairyland, there were a lot of people swarming, and the roaring and shouting voice was just like the devil&rsquo;s hell. Later, more and more people crowded in here, and there was no place to intervene.</p>
<p>And above the sky, a cloud is more profound than the red shadow in the sky. It looks like a big red cloud of blood cells flying slowly to the sky above the cloud sea platform, from which comes a burst of laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha ha ha ha, the waste people of Qingyun gate, now I finally know how powerful I am! Ha ha ha Why don&rsquo;t you come out, daoxuan? Don&rsquo;t you always want to save all the people in the world? Is the zhuxianjian array invincible in the world? How can you be a turtle with a shrinking head and dare not come out? Ha ha ha ha&hellip; &ldquo;.</p>
<p>The laughter was unrestrained and rampant, almost hysterical. However, the violent atmosphere enveloped the whole Qingyun Mountain with a hopeless atmosphere.</p>
<p>However, at this time, the attack of the demon sect army was temporarily stopped. There was no other reason. The only reason was that all the people on the right path of Tongtian peak defended the Hongqiao by virtue of the geographical advantages. Hongqiao is a natural wonder, but now it has become an insurmountable natural moat for the army of the demon cult. The huge bridge deck is usually open, but for the 100000 demon sect army, it is almost the same as the single tree bridge.</p>
<p>Those crazy and irrational people rushed to the bridge deck, but after a while, they only heard the scream of &ldquo;ah ah ah&rdquo; from time to time. However, some people couldn&rsquo;t stop their feet, or they were too crowded. They were pushed down the bottomless abyss under the Hongqiao bridge and quickly turned into black spots and were swallowed up by the deep sea of clouds.</p>
<p>But Zhengdao was caught unprepared by the army of the demon cult. In addition, there was a big gap in strength, so it collapsed in the sea of clouds. But at the moment, the elites who had gathered in the Yuqing hall joined the station group one after another, and their fighting power was great. They only looked at the magic weapon that was waving in the air here in Hongqiao, which was much stronger than that just now.</p>
<p>Although the number of the demon sect is large, only a few dozen can fight head-on. Most of the forces of the demon sect are bewitched by the Demon power of the four spirit blood array. Although the four spirit blood array can stimulate their potential, become infinitely powerful and climb like flying, they can&rsquo;t make them learn all kinds of immortal family skills to control the sword and fly in a thousand miles in a day, Most of them can only stand on the ground and rush forward. When they come across the natural moat like Hongqiao on Tongtian peak, they can only do nothing!.</p>
<p>Although there are still many practitioners who have been deprived of their minds, they can fly up and fight in the air.</p>
<p>But after all, it was only a small number. On the one hand, the right path sent more people to defend the Hongqiao bridge, and on the other hand, they assigned experts to deal with the small number of demon sect experts who had come by leaps. They all suppressed them in an instant.</p>
<p>In this way, the right side actually slowly stabilized its position and brought the situation back. On the other side of the demon sect, countless people with red eyes and craziness can only crowd on the small but long Hongqiao bridge. They can&rsquo;t enter or retreat, and the time is a little longer.</p>
<p>The turmoil became more and more fierce, and more and more people fell down on Hongqiao and were killed at the same time. It seems that the number of people killed by those in the right way seems to be much higher than that of the people in the right way.</p>
<p>Although the situation is still not optimistic at the moment, it is much better than the sudden defeat in the war just now.</p>
<p>However, these hopes did not exist in the hearts of the righteous people for a long time. After the demon cult army was blocked at one end of the Hongqiao bridge, the weird huge blood cells in the sky slowly crossed the cloud sea platform and flew to the top of the Hongqiao.</p>
<p>Red blood puff and puff, in the air like a terrible devil.</p>
<p>A moment later, from the huge blood cells, suddenly towards the right crowd at the end of Hongqiao on Tongtian peak, a dozen bloody beams of light were shot down.</p>
<p>Master Puhong of Tianyin temple and others have already dealt with the demon cult before, so that when they saw the huge blood cells flying up, their faces were dignified. This time, seeing the strange light column, master Puhong&rsquo;s face changed greatly, and he yelled in a quick voice: &ldquo;hurry up, that light pillar is just the thing that the demon bewitches the mind.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>After hearing this, they all changed their color and walked away. However, the people in the right path concentrated at the end of the Hongqiao bridge to resist the attack of the demon sect. The light column from the sky shot down quickly, so it was impossible for them to dodge completely.</p>
<p>Only a few screams were made, but there were already several righteous disciples who couldn&rsquo;t escape. They were covered by a column of blood colored light. All of a sudden, their bodies were shocked. Then their faces twisted, their movements became slow and stiff, and their eyes slowly glowed with red light.</p>
<p>There are people nearby who don&rsquo;t understand the situation. Some of them are friends of the same family. In a hurry, they rush forward to pull the victims out of the light. Who knows that the people under the light and shadow turn over their faces in an instant.</p>
<p>It turned out that the backhand was merciless, and they were all holding sharp knives and magic weapons to chop up the people around them. Among them, several of those who rushed to save people died under their friends&rsquo; hands.</p>
<p>Suddenly, there were shouts and screams. Master Pu Hong was livid and gnawed his teeth. He did not pay attention to the Buddhist precepts, and cried out: &ldquo;those Taoist friends who have lost their minds Kill! &ldquo;.</p>
<p>After that, the pain on his face flashed by. Knowledge was not the time to repent at this moment. In the absence of the immortal daoxuan of Qingyun gate, the people on the right side of the scene praised master Pu Hong as the most respected one.</p>
<p>He also understood that the situation was extremely bad at the moment. If he could support more than one point, he would not be humble at the moment. He stood up and gave a loud command under his words.</p>
<p>People in the right path catch up with each other, and finally get rid of those who confuse their minds. The situation has been stabilized for the time being.</p>
<p>A haze of knowledge has now completely enveloped the minds of all the righteous people present, just a short time ago.</p>
<p>These people are still fighting with their comrades in arms, but in the twinkling of an eye, the children can face each other, so who will be next? Or in other words, in case you are confused by your mind.</p>
<p>As if they were stimulated by something, the army of demon cult crowding on the Hongqiao bridge screamed with excitement. However, taking advantage of the small chaos of the people in the right path just now, a small number of followers of the demon cult rushed down the Hongqiao.</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong quickly ordered to encircle and exterminate them. Although they were mortals, most of them were powerful and tough after being demonized. The ordinary disciples of Qingyun sect, the magic sword, could not be killed at the same time, and they were held back for a moment.</p>
<p>That is to say, taking advantage of this short gap, the blood cells on the sky roar, among them, there are a dozen beams of light shot down in the twinkling of an eye, the red light is flashing, extremely weird.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, people in the right path fled one after another, and no one wanted to become those living characters in front of them.</p>
<p>Although master Pu Hong tried his best to command, the people in the right path were in chaos. The demon sect army on Hongqiao was shouting and shouting, and the pressure was increasing. Some of the remaining righteous people who had been struggling to support left and right were clumsy. Finally, they could not hold on. They just heard the &ldquo;boom and boom&rdquo; several times, and several bodies were knocked out. They were just the right disciples who had been guarding the side of Hongqiao.</p>
<p>In an instant, such as the collapse of the huge dam, the violent crowd surged down. In the fierce roar, countless followers of the demon cult swarmed forward. All of a sudden, the people in the right path were scattered, and the whole defense line was completely crossed.</p>
<p>Hell on earth, as if in front of you!.</p>
<p>All people&rsquo;s hearts are left with the word despair. In the endless frenzied crowd, many books of the right path are separated, often a person has to face dozens of terrible and intrepid enemies, everyone is fighting to kill the enemy, because not to kill the enemy himself will be cut into meat paste, the sky red clouds flashing, blood steaming, that arrogant laughter seems to be more and more loud Full of contentment.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi was also fighting among the crowd. Tianya sword was flying up and down beside her with light blue light. Every cold light passed by, there would be enemies roaring and losing their lives. Only one enemy fell down. In a flash, two or three or even four or five people rushed up.</p>
<p>She was dressed in white. It&rsquo;s all red with blood now.</p>
<p>Gradually, her movements became slower and slower, and her arms seemed to be getting heavier and heavier. The incessant cries of despair around her began to numb in her ears. She did not know how many lives she had taken under her sword, but tried to protect herself by instinct.</p>
<p>With her teeth clenched, she swung her sword and pushed back the three demon sect&rsquo;s paws. She was just about to parry a big knife from her left. Suddenly, she felt soft at her feet, and her body fell off.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi was shocked in her heart and tried her best to make way to her side. However, she felt a twinkling of gold in her eyes. A moment later, a sharp pain came from her left shoulder and blood spattered.</p>
<p>On the contrary, the pain aroused her body&rsquo;s residual strength. She was bitten by her teeth, and Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s backhand sword. Tianya sword was so powerful that she immediately knocked the enemy to the ground. But at the same time, dozens of terrible figures around her had already rushed over.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s heart flashed a sense of despair, but at this time, there was no look of fear and fear on her face. Under the cover of the sun, she sighed slightly, as if she had accepted her fate, and closed her eyes.</p>
<p>As soon as she turned her hand, Tianya sword was so bright that she called out in a low voice: &ldquo;Xiao Fan&hellip;&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In the quiet sound, Tianya sword wiped away her white neck.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi is about to die. At the moment of crisis, the sound of a strong wind suddenly came, and a strong force stopped the Tianya sword from Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s neck. At the same time, the strong wind blew up, and the people who came here shocked all the followers of the demon cult with invisible strength.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi was surprised. She opened her eyes and saw that it was her teacher, Shui Yue, who saved her life. Master Shuiyue&rsquo;s face did not look very good. Obviously, she also consumed a lot of energy. She even had several wounds hanging on her body.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi called out: &ldquo;master&hellip;&rdquo; I can&rsquo;t talk anymore.</p>
<p>Although master Shuiyue forced back the enemies around her, she was pale and panting. However, her eyes were still firm, and she said to Lu Xueqi, &ldquo;Xueqi, live on, remember master&rsquo;s words, live well&hellip;&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Suddenly, master, you lost your face and said, &ldquo;master, you are shocked.</p>
<p>Her voice suddenly became hoarse. A sharp long knife, with blood traces, came out of master Shuiyue&rsquo;s chest. Master Shuiyue&rsquo;s body shook for a while, and then she burst into a rage.</p>
<p>Suddenly, he turned around and took a slap. He immediately dumped the attacker several feet away. The blood gushed wildly, and he was dead.</p>
<p>But the man was also brave. Although he lost his life, his body flew out, and he still held on to the long knife. He saw blood splashing and the knife left his body. Master Shuiyue gave a painful hum, and his body turned twice in the same place. Finally, he couldn&rsquo;t hold on and fell down.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s mind was blank for a moment, and she didn&rsquo;t know where the strength was coming from. Tianya sword was so brilliant that it was like an angry phoenix flying into the sky. At that time, she forced all the members of the demon sect within a ten meter radius to retreat. During this period, many people could not escape and died under Tianya.</p>
<p>After pushing back the followers of the demon sect, she staggered to the side of the water moon general trend. She hugged the general trend of the water moon. Her eyes were dim and she cried, &ldquo;master, master What&rsquo;s the matter with you? Don&rsquo;t leave.</p>
<p>Water moon trend chest wound is too deep, blood spring spurt out, a glance to see that it is a lack of skills.</p>
<p>Even the light in her eyes was disappearing quickly, but she still seemed to hear the cry of her beloved disciple. The last smile appeared on her pale face. Looking at Lu Xueqi, she said intermittently, &ldquo;Xueqi Remember Live well Go&hellip; &ldquo;.</p>
<p>A &ldquo;to&rdquo; word barely spit out, master Shuiyue seems to have lost all his strength, his body slightly shakes, and then softens down, a pair of eyes, also slowly closed.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi was like a thunderbolt, and her whole body was crumbling. However, the people in the demon sect around her would not give her time. Just taking advantage of this moment, a large number of enemies rushed forward. Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s face turned pale, as if she could not bear the fact that her master died in front of her, or that she had lost her desire to survive after all.</p>
<p>However, a figure suddenly rushed by her side and pulled her away in danger. Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s body was shocked. In a twinkling of an eye, Lu Xueqi was covered with the same blood stained elder martial sister Wen min. Lu Xueqi was sour and sobbed: &ldquo;elder martial sister, master, she, she&hellip;&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Wen Min also has tears in her eyes, but she still clenches her teeth. She pushes her enemy back with a sword, grabs Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s hand tightly and shouts: &ldquo;younger martial sister, listen to master&rsquo;s words, we should live well!&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi body a shock, turn back gradually submerged in the demon cult crowd, that has lost the declaration of the figure looked at, like two groups of flame suddenly burning in the eyes.</p>
<p>After gnashing her teeth, she finally wielded the Tianya sword again, backed up with Wen Min, exhausted every part of her body&rsquo;s strength, fought hard and persevered, and struggled to support the hope of living for every minute.</p>
<p>The bloody light was still overwhelming, but there was no sunshine. The fierce battlefield had turned into a hell on earth. More and more people died in the right way. At this time, the blue water cold pool on the edge of Hongqiao suddenly roared, and the water burst. A huge spirit beast leaped out. It was the water unicorn of Qingyun gate town.</p>
<p>Almost without any hesitation, Shui Qilin has already burst into the dense crowd of demon cult.</p>
<p>The sharp claws were flying and the huge mouth was devouring. This immediately made the demon sect&rsquo;s formation in chaos. Such a huge thing, even the most ferocious people would instinctively fear and flee one after another.</p>
<p>The sudden appearance of the water Qilin gave the Rightists who were almost destroyed by the army a chance to breathe. Many of the followers of the demon cult rushed back to the giant beast. Under the heavy pressure, many of the righteous people who could hardly hold on to it were lucky to escape.</p>
<p>Seeing the water Kirin rushing from left to right among the demon cult crowd, he was swept away. His cries of despair kept coming and going, and his popularity was as good as ever.</p>
<p>On the other side of the main path, they all took advantage of this opportunity to retreat to the stone steps of Yuqing hall. Lu Xueqi and Wen Min had already almost completely lost their strength. Wen Min&rsquo;s Taoism was one notch worse than Lu Xueqi. The enemy in front of her temporarily retreated. Without the momentum of killing the enemy, she could hardly even walk up the stone steps.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi is no better than Wen Min, but in the end, the two teachers and sisters still help each other and barely walk up the Yuqing hall.</p>
<p>However, when they looked around, they could not help but feel a little cool in their hearts. Standing in front of the Yuqing hall, there were less than 200 people standing on the right path in front of Yuqing hall, and they were all wounded and bloodstained.</p>
<p>When they looked at each other, they saw the despair in each other&rsquo;s eyes. Even though Shui Qilin was brave, how could he last long under the demon sect&rsquo;s law?.</p>
<p>Sure enough, although Shui Qilin was invincible at the beginning and attracted all the attention of the demon cult army, with the increasing pressure around him, although he roared loudly, he was gradually showing a decline, especially those monks attacking with magic weapons from time to time in the crowd.</p>
<p>The damage to water Qilin is especially serious. In addition, there are endless forces of demon cults rushing in like ants. After half an hour, shuiqilin finally shows a timid look, and his body is full of scars.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, he saw the giant flash, and let out an earth shaking roar, but he turned back and strode to open a path of blood. He jumped back into the cold pool of blue water again and dived into the deep water and never showed up again.</p>
<p>Although most of the people on the right path in Yuqing hall had seen the result in the battle just now, when Shui Qilin was defeated and fled, everyone was still showing a look of pain. Looking at the dark demon sect&rsquo;s paws turning here again, a sense of despair filled the crowd.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi struggled to stand up and gently lifted the Tianya sword across her neck. Wen Min was surprised. She just wanted to stop her. Lu Xueqi had already said softly: &ldquo;elder martial sister, forget it. It&rsquo;s impossible. I&rsquo;d rather kill myself than let those dirty hands kill me again.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>With tears in her eyes, Wen Min suddenly comes a footstep behind her. She looks back and shakes her body, but it is song Daren of dazhufeng. Song Daren smiles and reaches out to hold her white palm tightly.</p>
<p>Wen Min seems to suddenly get the courage, there is no longer fear and despair, slowly showing a gentle smile, she turned to Lu Xueqi and said: &ldquo;younger martial sister, you can go at ease, we will accompany you soon.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi took a look at the palms they held tightly, and the figures nestling in each other. Slowly, a trace of smile appeared in the corners of her mouth. Then, she closed her eyes and called softly in her heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Xiao Fan, we&rsquo;ll see you in the next life&hellip;&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The icy air of Tianya divine sword seems to penetrate into the blood through her skin. She smiles and grabs the handle of the sword suddenly. Suddenly, Wen Min, next to her, suddenly screams: &ldquo;younger martial sister, wait a minute.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi was stunned for a moment, put down Tianya and said in surprise: &ldquo;what?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Wen Min turned around, but looked at the back mountain of Tongtian peak and said in astonishment, &ldquo;listen, listen What&rsquo;s that noise? &ldquo;.</p>
<p>The originally violent and noisy battlefield, I do not know why, suddenly become quiet, there is no sound, those big army of the demon cult, one by one, are in the same place.</p>
<p>In the silence of silence, the old Tongtian peak and the whole mountain range are shaking slowly.</p>
<p>A low, long whistle, from the mountain behind the peak in the same day burst out, gradually lifted up, turned into a passionate Qingyue, sound crack gold stone straight into the sky.</p>
<p>In the howling sound, a huge light soared into the sky, like a giant dragon imprisoned for thousands of years, leaped out and galloped for nine days. The wind howled and the heaven and earth changed color. All the mountains bowed their heads, and the magic weapons and weapons in the hands of countless people began to tremble slightly on their own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zhu Xian Killing immortals That&rsquo;s killing immortals.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a cry of surprise sounded in front of Yuqing hall. Among the remaining disciples of Qingyun gate, even those seriously injured, seemed to have completely forgotten the pain.</p>
<p>Struggling to stand up to see, that bright and spectacular light column, penetrating the sky and earth, as if it was their unparalleled pride and sustenance!.</p>
<p>legend of chusen!.</p>
<p>The sky, which was covered by the bloody red light, was suddenly forced away by the sudden brilliance. The bright light soared under the nine days and came at a gallop. In the sky of Tongtian peak, it burst out in a flash and radiated out a thousand feet of light, like the hot sun falling into the world, driving away all the darkness.</p>
<p>In the depth of the brilliance, a figure slowly emerged. However, the brilliance was so brilliant that he could not see his face clearly. Only in the twinkling of light and shadow, people could clearly see that the figure slowly raised an ancient sword in his hand.</p>
<p>Ancient sword for killing immortals!.</p>
<p>In an instant, a burst of thunderous cheers broke out on the Yuqing hall. Wen Min and song Daren were both full of tears. Only Lu Xueqi suddenly shook her body and showed an unbelievable look on her face. But at the moment everyone looked at the sky, and no one found her strange.</p>
<p>Although the figure on the sky, which is indistinct in the light, can&rsquo;t be seen clearly, the silhouette shadow has already been deeply engraved in her heart, and she will never forget it. How can she not recognize it?.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Xiao Fan&hellip;&rdquo;.</p>
<p>She cried in her heart for thousands of times, holding tightly to her breast and skirt with her hands, as if only in this way could she suppress her heart beating wildly.</p>
<p>At the moment, the strange blood cells on the sky over the demon sect had already discovered this mysterious visitor, and they turned around in a long time. Both sides were covered with brilliance, one white and one red, with a faint sense of confrontation.</p>
<p>A moment later, suddenly from the blood cells came a voice with the meaning of anger: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s you!&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In the face of the ghost King&rsquo;s question, the figure in the brilliance did not have any answer. He just raised the ancient sword of killing immortals in his hand. In an instant, the sound of strange roaring suddenly rose. Under the boundless sky, seven colorful columns of light shot from the seven peaks of Qingyun Mountain range, which rose like a dragon flying across the sky, and finally converged on the ancient sword of killing immortals.</p>
<p>The sound of whistling became more and more loud, which filled the world with this sound. After a moment, it seemed that the past time appeared again. Under the sky, the huge colorful air sword appeared. The Zhuxian sword array, which was once popular in the minds of countless people, finally appeared in the world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go to hell!&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In the sound of fury, the strange blood cells in the sky also changed. The blood was rolling to both sides, revealing its true features. People looked at them and were so knowledgeable that they could not help but gasp and gasp.</p>
<p>In the middle of the blood cell, surrounded by the huge blood, is the Fulong Ding which has completely turned blood red. But what is most surprising is that the ghost King&rsquo;s body has become more than half in this Fulong tripod, leaving only the chest and head above the ancient tripod. His face is twisted and ferocious, and he stares at the bright figure in the opposite.</p>
<p>As soon as he waved his hand, he suddenly felt like a huge force. The countless blood Qi in half of the sky was rolled up. The momentum was incomparable. The blood gas red clouds like torrents turned into a huge red spear stretching across the sky in the hands of the ghost king. The hot electric light tore and ran on it, which was terrible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, I&rsquo;ll tear you to pieces, brute!&rdquo; The king of ghosts seems to have lost his sense completely, leaving only the desire to kill. The huge red spear suddenly bumps into Zhuxian Guanghui.</p>
<p>On Tongtian peak, although they have great confidence in Zhuxian sword array, they still change color and can&rsquo;t speak. Lu Xueqi looks pale and stares at the sky.</p>
<p>This time, the appearance of Zhuxian sword array is different from that of the previous two times driven by daoxuan immortal. In addition to a huge colorful air sword which is arrogant and arrogant, there is no such thing as the ever-changing and overwhelming millions of petty Qi swords. However. I don&rsquo;t know why, although there is only one Qi sword, the power of the Zhuxian sword array is better than that of the past. A small movement of the colorful sword on the brilliance seems to have the terrible power of tearing the sky and pulling the stars.</p>
<p>Seeing the huge red spear breaking through the sky, it was unstoppable. Some people in the crowd exclaimed, but the figure in the light didn&rsquo;t even mean to dodge. On the contrary, he faced the huge red spear, and suddenly waved his sword with both hands. Suddenly, the thunder and wind exploded in the sky and roared. Under the blue sky, the huge sword of Zhuxian suddenly turned around and chopped at the red spear Go.</p>
<p>Two terrible huge weapons collided with each other in the sky, and suddenly burst out a thousand times hotter than the sun. No one can open their eyes, only hear the earth shaking in the loud noise. The whole Qingyun Mountain Range seems to be unable to resist the great power of heaven and earth, and they want to bow down in fear.</p>
<p>The light was a little scattered, and people could not wait to look at the sky. On the battlefield, there was a huge whirlpool of air. The deep black was like a bottomless abyss, staring at the mundane world coldly. Under the whirlpool, the colorful sword of killing immortals disappeared, and turned into a dazzling white lightsaber, piercing the sky and splitting with the momentum of destroying the sky and the earth Go down.</p>
<p>The big red spear broke in response!.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah&hellip;&rdquo; The terrible scream came from the mouth of the ghost king who was integrated with the Fulong Ding. With unbelievable despair, he even had blood in his eyes. He roared: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s impossible, it&rsquo;s impossible I have the power of Shura, I have the power of Shura&hellip; &ldquo;.</p>
<p>The last words were drowned in the violent wind. Zhuxian sword split the huge blood spear, but it didn&rsquo;t retreat. Instead, it went straight ahead. In an instant, the whole sky was covered by the brilliance of Zhuxian ancient sword. The sky was rolling, as if all the gods and demons in the world were trembling and afraid at the moment, which was the terrible power of killing immortals!.</p>
<p>That sword, straight to the Fulong Ding, straight to the ghost king, straight to the blood cell deep, that red cloud evil depth!.</p>
<p>The blazing light burned everything, rolled up all the light in the sky, the wind and cloud thunder and lightning tore and roared endlessly, countless remnant clouds were swept up and swallowed up into the unfathomable black whirlpool in the sky.</p>
<p>The ghost King&rsquo;s face showed a look of despair, but the despair showed more madness. He laughed wildly, cried wildly, waved his hands, and suddenly inserted into the eyes of the devil&rsquo;s face on the volong tripod.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boom An angry thunder suddenly suppressed all the sounds above the sky. The ghost King&rsquo;s eyes suddenly spewed two blood columns. After being seriously injured, he was still laughing wildly. On the Fulong tripod, as if inspired by the final divine power, a terrible bloody figure, as high as ten thousand feet, slowly formed behind the ghost king.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go to hell!&rdquo; Crazy roar, resounding through the sky, that strange blood devil&rsquo;s shadow suddenly moves, with a terrifying momentum, affects the whole sky of blood, again to kill the immortal glory.</p>
<p>The hot white light sword of Zhuxian ancient sword also stabbed the Fulong Ding in the next moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah&hellip;&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In the terrible roar, with heartrending pain, the dazzling brilliance burst out. Behind, a figure was forced out of the Fulong Ding by the ancient sword of killing immortals. It seemed that he had lost all his strength and flew far away, disappearing into the distant sky, and could no longer be seen.</p>
<p>At this time, the terrible blood demon shadow had already rushed to the shining figure, and lost the protection of the ancient sword of killing immortals. The figure now seems to be weak before the terrible strength of the blood demon shadow.</p>
<p>In the roar, the figure in the brilliance was captured by the blood devil. Only for a moment, the light dissipated, and the figure was engulfed by the blood shadow. The people on the Tongtian peak were shocked and screamed repeatedly. Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s body was shocked, and her blood color was completely lost. &ldquo;Wow&rdquo; burst out a mouthful of blood, and her body was crumbling.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, the blood devil who saw the victory and laughed wildly, the huge body suddenly froze, and the giant sword of killing immortals, flashing with the burning and shining power of killing immortals, penetrated into his chest from behind.</p>
<p>Around the ancient sword of Zhuxian, the turbulent blood suddenly dissipated, and the huge body showed a terrible wound, which rapidly expanded. The blood demon&rsquo;s shadow gave out an earth shaking roar. At the moment before the body was about to be broken, it suddenly threw the weak and weak body into the terrible and deep whirlpool in the sky, and was instantly engulfed by a group of light and disappeared without a trace.</p>
<p>Then, the blood demon shadow gave out a final roar, and finally could not support the erosion of the terrible power of killing immortals in his chest. Under the hot white light, the roar disappeared.</p>
<p>In the sky, the red clouds gradually receded, the clouds gradually subsided, and they lost the control of the blood. The countless followers of the demon cult seemed to have a nightmare. The red light in their eyes dissipated, and they gradually came to wake up. Right here, everyone faces the situation, after the nightmare, it seems that there is an incredible illusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won? Won? &quot; Everyone asked each other so, tears filled their eyes, as if they could not believe everything in front of them.</p>
<p>Wen Min and song Daren hugged each other tightly. After a while, Wen Min remembered something. With tears and a smile, he turned to look at Lu Xueqi and said with a bitter smile: &ldquo;younger martial sister, younger martial sister. Look at us&hellip;. &ldquo;.</p>
<p>Her voice suddenly smothered. Behind her, Lu Xueqi collapsed as if she had no more anger. She fainted, but this little sadness was soon drowned out by the roar of cheers from the top and bottom of Tongtian peak.</p>
<p>The whirlpool above the sky slowly disappeared, and the warm sunshine sprinkled on the world again, with peace and warmth long lost. (to be continued. )。</p>
