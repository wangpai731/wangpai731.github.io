      <p>The night is dark and cold.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a ray of light crossed in the dark, flying quickly and incomparably from afar, but from afar, the light seemed to tremble faintly, showing signs of instability.</p>
<p>On the ground, Meng Ji is walking back and forth anxiously. Behind him are the remaining disciples of the longevity hall. Roughly speaking, there are about fifty or sixty people. They look scared one by one and look forward to the future.</p>
<p>Until they saw the beam.</p>
<p>The ordinary disciples were in a commotion, and many cheered. Meng Ji watched the figure coming, and his anxious face became heavier.</p>
<p>The light came to a close, stopped, and yuyangzi fell to the ground. All the people called &ldquo;sect leader and sect leader&rdquo; together. Unexpectedly, yuyangzi&rsquo;s face was white and &ldquo;wow&rdquo; with a loud sound, he spewed out a lot of blood and dyed his front skirt red.</p>
<p>All the people were in disgrace.</p>
<p>Meng Ji grabs Yu Yangzi and holds him. His tentacles are cold. He only feels that Yu Yangzi&rsquo;s whole body is cold and unusual. Under his clothes, his body is still shivering. He can&rsquo;t help but lose his color.</p>
<p>Yu Yangzi felt Meng Ji&rsquo;s fright and looked to the left and right again. He saw that the disciples under his door were also frightened. He knew that these people were frightened birds now and were in great disorder. If he could not support them, he would immediately fall down and disperse the monkeys.</p>
<p>At present, he strengthened his spirit and pressed down the Qi and blood in his chest. In a loud voice, he said, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t need to panic. I just worked hard to force blood stasis out of my body. It&rsquo;s OK.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In ordinary days, yuyangzi was in the heart of the disciples of the longevity hall, just like the god man. Now, this kind of saying has some effect. Many of the faces of the disciples look a little slower, obviously relieved a lot.</p>
<p>But yuyangzi&rsquo;s face was really poor, white as paper, and his left body was bloodstained, even his sleeve was missing. It&rsquo;s a mess. It&rsquo;s also good that it&rsquo;s late at night. The night is thick. Otherwise, if it&rsquo;s in the daytime, more than 100 eyes will brush it. It was immediately apparent that he was at the end of his tether.</p>
<p>Meng Ji frowned, and then turned to the disciples of the longevity hall and said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s OK for the headmaster. You can take a rest first, and then make plans after daybreak!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The crowd gradually dispersed. When the disciples of Changsheng hall went far away, Meng Ji suddenly felt that yuyangzi&rsquo;s body was sinking suddenly. He quickly helped him and looked at yuyangzi. His heart almost jumped out.</p>
<p>I saw that there was no blood on yuyangzi&rsquo;s face, and he was breathing heavily. If he didn&rsquo;t hold it by himself, he would almost lose his support.</p>
<p>Meng Ji quickly helps yuyangzi to sit down. Yuyangzi meditates on the ground and slowly breathes. After a long time, the wheezing voice gradually calmed down, and his face looked better.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Meng Ji has been standing beside yuyangzi. He looks nervous and worried. At the same time, he can&rsquo;t stop looking around.</p>
<p>The night is deep around. Except for the small fire made by the students of the longevity hall nearby, there is darkness everywhere.</p>
<p>Night is ferocious, as if also peeping at the wind and rain of the hall of eternal life, the fallen faction.</p>
<p>Yuyangzi slowly opens his eyes.</p>
<p>Meng Ji immediately whispered, &ldquo;are you OK, sect leader?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yuyangzi smiled bitterly, in his eyes. Naturally, Meng Ji can&rsquo;t be compared with those ordinary people, sighing slightly: &ldquo;I was just surrounded by those kids in the right way, and I wasted a lot of energy. Later, there was a woman who used the&rdquo; magic sword to resist thunder &ldquo;of Qingyun gate&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meng Ji&rsquo;s face changed greatly. &ldquo;Surprised:&rdquo; these people have such a master</p>
<p>Yuyangzi hated and said: &ldquo;more than that, I have several people, at least three or four of whom are extremely qualified in Taoism. At the end of the day, I can only cast the&rdquo; blood charm &ldquo;, which makes me rush out by force!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meng Ji&rsquo;s face changed again and again. The blood charm is a famous true magic spell in the longevity hall. It can strengthen the Taoism in an instant, but the power of backfiring after the event is extremely terrible. It&rsquo;s needless to say that the great damage of Taoism will not only damage people&rsquo;s Yang life.</p>
<p>Zheng for a moment, Meng Ji just returned to God and said to Yu Yangzi, &ldquo;sect leader, what are we going to do now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yuyangzi&rsquo;s face was dignified and silent for a moment. He said in hate: &ldquo;now we have to fight with the arrow. After daybreak, we will go to the depth of the dead water immediately and go to the&rdquo; inner water &ldquo;to find treasures!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meng Ji&rsquo;s face changed greatly. He couldn&rsquo;t help saying: &ldquo;sect leader&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a wave of his hand, yuyangzi blocked Meng Ji&rsquo;s words and said, &ldquo;I know what you want to say, but now that we withdraw from shisha, sooner or later, we will die in the hands of the other three sects. It&rsquo;s better to fight on this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meng Ji stared at Yu Yangzi in a dazed way. He saw the fierce color in his pale face, but it was more intense. He expected that he could not persuade him to come back, so he got up slowly, looked up at the sky, and sighed in his heart.</p>
<p>This huge death swamp in the southwest of HaoTu, Shenzhou, has a radius of 8000 miles, which is continuous and rare since ancient times.</p>
<p>And it is divided into two layers: the first is waize, which is the place where people are now. It belongs to the periphery of the dead Ze, occupying 78% of the dead Ze&rsquo;s land. Among them, there are many bottomless mud pits and poisonous insects. But for the monks, they don&rsquo;t pay attention to it. As long as they are careful not to step wrong, they will not be in any way.</p>
<p>But there is a mystery in the deepest part of the dead water, which is a place surrounded by poisonous biogas all the year round. No one has ever known what it looks like inside. It&rsquo;s that occasionally there are monks who go in and explore, but they have no life ever since. Therefore, the good and evil families are generally unwilling to rush in.</p>
<p>In these days, countless people have searched for treasures in the dead water, but up to now, there is no news. Yuyangzi had long expected that the treasures would be in the most dangerous and unpredictable water. In normal times, yuyangzi may have to worry a lot, at least prepare carefully for many days, but now the situation is pressing, he himself is like a gambler in a hurry, and he can&rsquo;t care about anything else.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>The night wind blows.</p>
<p>Most of the disciples of the longevity hall, who had been busy and struggling for a day, fell asleep. The flames of the fire on the ground were gradually extinguished. Yu Yangzi was still sitting low. Meng Ji, who was still standing by, probably went to his disciples at the moment.</p>
<p>Suddenly, yuyangzi suddenly opened his eyes. His eyes were fierce, but he seemed to look around with a little fear.</p>
<p>The night was deep and dark.</p>
<p>His muscles tensed all over his body, then he stood up slowly.</p>
<p>The only hand, grasp the yin-yang mirror.</p>
<p>The wind was cold and penetrating, blowing on his body, as if it was cold to his heart.</p>
<p>Deep in the dark, footsteps began to sound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pa, PA, PA&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sand, sand, sand&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hua, Hua, Hua&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>As if with their own different rhythm, at the same time, from three directions. The slight but neat sound of footsteps converges towards the longevity hall.</p>
<p>For the first time, there was a trace of despair on yuyangzi&rsquo;s face, and he suddenly shouted, &ldquo;get out of here, beast!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is a big drink. However, there was a lack of vitality in the vigorous, but it was still far away from the swamp, which immediately awakened the long life hall disciples in the distance from their sleep and scrambled up in a hurry. Come together quickly.</p>
<p>Yuyangzi&rsquo;s face was cloudy and clear, and his heart sank. Looking back, he was stunned and said in a loud voice, &ldquo;where is Meng Ji?&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the people in the longevity hall looked at each other, but no one answered for a while, obviously they didn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Yu Yangzi&rsquo;s Qi surged upward, and his brain was dizzy. Almost a mouthful of blood came out again.</p>
<p>This is the time. Suddenly in the dark came a peaceful man&rsquo;s voice, and said, &ldquo;Uncle yuyangzi, are you looking for this man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a sound of &ldquo;Wu&rdquo;, a thing flew out of the darkness in front of the longevity hall, crossed an arc, fell in front of yuyangzi and all the disciples of the longevity hall, and rolled a few rolls.</p>
<p>Someone had already hit a torch nearby. Under the light of the fire, he suddenly exclaimed that this was the head of Meng Ji who was still standing here talking with the people. His eyes were wide open. But there was a look of horror in his eyes, for fear that he would die with his eyes closed.</p>
<p>Yuyangzi took a deep breath, his eyes moved away from the head of his last powerful man, and stared at the front. Cold way: &ldquo;Qin Wuyan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A young man came out slowly, pale, but with a gentle smile on his face. He said with a smile, &ldquo;martial uncle really has a good eye. Little nephew is standing in the dark, and you can recognize him. Admire, admire! &quot;</p>
<p>Yu Yangzi said coldly, &ldquo;you are cruel, but your ten thousand poisons treat the same disciples of the holy religion like this. Isn&rsquo;t your old poisons master afraid of being sent into the earth by the Emperor Ming after death?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; Qin Wuyan put his hand on his chest and made a frightened look, but his face was peaceful with a smile. He turned to the other side and said, &ldquo;Jinxian, we dare not bear such a big crime. Don&rsquo;t you come out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yuyangzi&rsquo;s face changed a lot. She turned around and saw that in the darkness on the left side, a beautiful woman walked out slowly. Her eyebrows were full of amorous feelings. In the dark night, when she walked out, she seemed to be a little brighter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Golden Vase!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yuyangzi seemed to be gnashing his teeth and pronouncing these three words.</p>
<p>Jin pinger smiled and said, &ldquo;Uncle yuyangzi, I haven&rsquo;t seen you for a long time. How are you always doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This greeting is more vicious than the most vicious curse. Yuyangzi stares at her and says in a cold voice, &ldquo;I have always been with the well water of Hehuan sect not to offend the river. Why are you going to fall into the well together with these guys of wandumen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jin Ping&rsquo;er smiled and said, &ldquo;you are really forgetful. A few days ago, you heard that I came to die Ze, and worried that our joy sect would snatch treasures from you, so you ordered people to kill the disciples of the ten thousand poisons sect, snatched the unique poison&rdquo; black toad powder &ldquo;, and killed four disciples of our joy sect in the north of Dawang village with this poison. Can you do this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Yu Yangzi&rsquo;s face changed, he lost his voice and said, &ldquo;how do you&hellip;&rdquo; Half said, he immediately shut up.</p>
<p>Jin Ping&rsquo;er said lightly: &ldquo;martial uncle, you have a long-term plan to provoke us to fight with the ten thousand poisons sect. It&rsquo;s really brilliant. It&rsquo;s only thanks to Qin Wuyan, elder martial brother Qin, to reason and investigate carefully, and finally find out the truth. Otherwise, we will be killed by you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Qin Wuyan said with a smile, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m honored to be able to serve the fairy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yuyangzi&rsquo;s mind is turning rapidly. The situation is in danger. Although these two people are young, their fame has spread all over the world in recent years. They are not easy to deal with. Moreover, they have many figures behind them. Although they have never appeared, they are afraid of the hidden ambush of the ten thousand poison sect and the Hehuan sect. If so, they are afraid that tonight is really a bad day.</p>
<p>Yu Yangzi was turning around. Suddenly, he heard the disciples behind him stir up. He seemed to see something terrible. He turned back quickly. At that time, his face was bloodless. He saw the only way back. In the dark, his face was indifferent and he came out slowly.</p>
<p>At this moment, yuyangzi&rsquo;s heart is turning. He knows that he is in despair. He says with a smile: &ldquo;it turns out that your three families have already agreed to deal with my longevity together. It&rsquo;s funny that I want to provoke you. The mantis catches cicadas. You yellow finches are in the future!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Qin Wuyan smiled. Suddenly, he said in a loud voice, &ldquo;you see, all the disciples of the longevity hall. Tonight, the longevity hall is exhausted. If you can understand each other. Then come quickly to our side, and you will live. &quot;</p>
<p>With his words, after Qin Wuyan, Jin pinger and GUI Li, the human figure floats, and countless people with magic weapons and sharp edges come out in the dark. And they gathered around him a group of people, led by yuyangzi.</p>
<p>The breeze at night, the hero&rsquo;s end!</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Everyone in the hall of longevity looked at each other. At this time, no one could see that it would be a dead end to fight again. They were besieged by the three gate valves of the demon sect. When they were at the end of their tethers, there was no life.</p>
<p>Yuyangzi cried bad in his heart, but after a while, someone shouted: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m down. I&rsquo;m down&hellip; &quot; Then he ran out and ran to Qin Wuyan.</p>
<p>Some people took their heads, and all of them immediately moved. In a moment, almost all of them ran out. After all, no one was willing to die. Yuyangzi was shocked and angry, and he stopped drinking. But at this critical moment of life and death, no one could care about him. More and more people from changshengtang were running. The situation is out of control and cannot be stopped.</p>
<p>Yuyangzi was full of anger, with fierce eyes and a loud roar. Jump into the crowd, grab a disciple of the longevity hall, and kill him. Everyone sees it and shouts, but runs faster. Only the unlucky ghost in his hand was so scared that he was all soft.</p>
<p>Yuyangzi&rsquo;s face was ferocious. He saw that the foundation of longevity hall had been destroyed for hundreds of years. He almost burst his chest with anger. He would strangle the man with his hands. But he saw that the man was so frightened that he could hardly cry.</p>
<p>Yuyangzi looked at him, and suddenly he looked back at the man who left his running door. Suddenly, he was frustrated, and his hand was loose, and the man fell to the ground.</p>
<p>The man came back with a life. He could hardly believe himself. He hurriedly ran away. The farther away he was, the better.</p>
<p>A moment later, there was only yuyangzi alone.</p>
<p>GUI Li, Qin Wuyan and Jin pinger go forward together.</p>
<p>Suddenly, there was silence in the field. Yu Yangzi&rsquo;s figure was bleak and his eyes swept. Qin Wuyan saw the Golden Vase and then saw the ghost. His lips moved. Suddenly he said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s it. That&rsquo;s it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li and other three people went to a place a foot away from Yu Yangzi and stopped. They formed a circle and surrounded Yu Yangzi in the middle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter? Uncle yuyangzi, do you have anything else to say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yuyangzi&rsquo;s eyes flashed with resentment, but his face was indifferent. After a moment, he said slowly, &ldquo;now I am in poverty. The name of longevity is up to now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Qin Wuyan said: &ldquo;martial uncle is really good at seeing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yuyangzi&rsquo;s body shakes. What kind of person he is today is going to be humiliated by these young people. His life is not as good as death. But he also endured it and said slowly, &ldquo;since I have no way to go, I&rsquo;ve also sent you down. It&rsquo;s a little useful for you to do this with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as these words were said, Qin Wuyan and Jin pinger were moved. Yu Yangzi was not under the Guiwang and the poison God. Especially tonight, he once fought against the ten most outstanding figures of the right path. All the demon sect people who were spying on the far away were all moved.</p>
<p>If we don&rsquo;t see a conflagration between the longevity hall and the right way, we need to remove the longevity hall. I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s not so simple. If you get the effect of yuyangzi, it&rsquo;s needless to say that it&rsquo;s the first strong aid. In the future, in the internal fight of the demon sect, it naturally takes up a lot of advantages.</p>
<p>Thinking of this, Qin Wuyan and Jin pinger are both ambitious people. They can&rsquo;t help hesitating.</p>
<p>At this time, the silent ghost suddenly said: &ldquo;you have such a high way of doing, such a big ambition, and higher than our generations. If you come to our ghost King clan, you are afraid that in the future, but you are above my head. Are you willing to do this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His words were light, but his eyes were sharp. He swept yuyangzi cold. Yuyangzi&rsquo;s heart was cold. Qin Wuyan and jinpinger were all smart people. In an instant, they had figured out the joint, and immediately smiled.</p>
<p>But in yuyangzi&rsquo;s eyes, it is no different from ghosts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Martial uncle is really smart. At this moment, I have such wonderful methods. I admire them!&rdquo; Gold bottle son Qiao smile Yan Ran, but in this smile at the same time, her right hand side, purple light but gradually lit up.</p>
<p>At the same time, almost at the same time, the ghost devouring and Qin Wuyan all made a step towards yuyangzi.</p>
<p>The night wind is bleak and cold.</p>
<p>Yuyangzi looks around, suddenly resents Nanping, roars, and starts to fight for the last time. He is not willing to wait for death!</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Far away. It&rsquo;s the right way to settle down here. This time, Xiao Yi specially sent several younger martial brothers to watch the night. It can be seen that he was very careful.</p>
<p>Next to the secluded place, Lu Xueqi sat quietly. After a while, Wenmin came back, sat down beside her, pouted a little, and said to her quietly, &ldquo;Song Daren. What a fool. &quot;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s eyes moved and looked away. In the distance, song Daren sat next to the fire. He was embarrassed. He didn&rsquo;t know what he had just said to Wen min. from time to time, he secretly looked here. He seemed worried, but he didn&rsquo;t dare to come.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi also had a smile in her eyes and said to Wen Min: &ldquo;elder martial sister, you have bullied people for many years. It&rsquo;s hard to come out. It&rsquo;s not good for him. &quot;</p>
<p>Wen Min snorted. She and Lu Xueqi were always close. She never concealed anything from her in front of the younger martial sister. She snorted softly and said: &ldquo;that man, he is too honest. I don&rsquo;t know what happened to martial uncle Tian. I heard that he seduced martial uncle Su Ru from our little Zhufeng No, when I married, it was smart. How can I teach my disciples to be so stupid&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi smiled, took back her eyes, and after a while. Suddenly he whispered, &ldquo;you are right. There were a lot of honest people among their disciples at dazhufeng&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Speaking of later, somehow, the voice gradually decreased, and Wen Min was stunned. Looked at Lu Xueqi, suddenly also sighed, lightly patted her shoulder, said: &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t want to think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi didn&rsquo;t speak, just looked down.</p>
<p>This night, quietly spent.</p>
<p>After daybreak, Xiao Yicai gathered all the people together and said: &ldquo;now the longevity hall is suffering a lot, we have no external enemies. Moreover, we searched for the dead Zeze for many days, but there was no news about the strange treasure. Do you have any opinions, elder martial brothers? &quot;</p>
<p>But Li Xun looked at Xiao Yicai and said, &ldquo;is senior brother Xiao trying to get into the dangerous inner chamber?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Yi was a little surprised, and nodded: &ldquo;not bad. Since we have arrived here, we cannot give up halfway. &quot;</p>
<p>FA Xiang frowned and said: &ldquo;although what elder martial brother Xiao said is reasonable, there are still many incredible monsters and poisonous insects in the deep of the dead water, which are extremely dangerous. It&rsquo;s too dangerous for so many people to go together. &quot;</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai nodded at once, and then said: &ldquo;yes, what elder martial brother Faxiang said is exactly what I&rsquo;m worried about. So I think it&rsquo;s better to let most of his younger martial brothers continue to search in waize. Several of us, together with some of our Taoist peers, enter neize. What do you think? &quot;</p>
<p>Li Xun pondered for a long time and nodded: &ldquo;that&rsquo;s all I have to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>FA Xiang nods in silence.</p>
<p>After the discussion, they went back to discuss the candidates. After a while, the incense valley was Li Xun and Yan Hong, the Tianyin temple was FA Xiang and FA Shan, and the Qingyun gate was a little larger. Besides Xiao Yicai, Lu Xueqi and Zeng Shushu were in the list. Lin Jingyu, who had a strong wind in the previous evening, was also in the list at his urging. In addition, people looked at him with great admiration, and finally he was in the list.</p>
<p>So eight people, after arranging the events in their own door, led by Xiao Yicai, took control of the magic weapons one after another and went to neize.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>On the other side of the swamp, looking at the calm swamp ahead, GUI Li and other three people stand side by side. Behind them are three rows of people and horses, each in groups, but they stand against each other, with a faint sense of vigilance.</p>
<p>Qin Wuyan sighed suddenly and said: &ldquo;Uncle yuyangzi, the hero of the first generation, now he has turned into the dead water, is it a good place to die?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ghost Li silent, gold bottle son light smile, also don&rsquo;t talk.</p>
<p>Qin Wuyan also doesn&rsquo;t care, smile way: &ldquo;how, next two prepare how?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gold bottle son looked at him one eye, suddenly turned around, while walking side way: &ldquo;the big matter has already, naturally should be separated!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Qin Wuyan looked at her back and said in a loud voice, &ldquo;Oh, does the fairy want to go back to restore her life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jin Ping&rsquo;er didn&rsquo;t have much to say. He smiled quietly. Qin Wuyan immediately said, &ldquo;then I&rsquo;ll be in the inner water. I&rsquo;m waiting for the fairy. Then, I&rsquo;ll ask you to be merciful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jin pinger didn&rsquo;t know whether to hear it or not. He walked far away. He Huan sent his disciples to follow her.</p>
<p>GUI Li glanced at Qin Wuyan with cold eyes, then turned around and went back to the crowd of the ghost King clan. Qin Wuyan stood in place, smiling and speechless, but his eyes were gradually cold.</p>
<p>In the swamp of death, the sky is more gloomy and cloudy, as if a greater storm is coming. (to be continued. )</p>
