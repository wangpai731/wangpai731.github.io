      <p>This beautiful woman is naturally Tian Ling&rsquo;er. When she saw that Zhang Xiaofan was injured, she was worried and ran quietly to visit. Unexpectedly, her mother was here too, so she hid outside the door until Su Ru left.</p>
<p>At this time she looked at Zhang Xiaofan as if froze, could not help but sigh: &ldquo;What are you doing standing there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan woke up with a red face, and was just trying to find an excuse to distinguish, but he saw Tian Ling&rsquo;er lower his head. It turned out that rhubarb ran over and rubbed her leg with his head very affectionately.</p>
<p>Tian Ling&rsquo;er bent down and touched Rhubarb&rsquo;s head. Rhubarb extended his tongue and licked her jade-like hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Squeaky&rdquo;, the voice of the monkey Xiaohui rang, the two looked at the dog at the same time, only to see that Xiaohui ran behind Dahuang, and pulled the big tail of it pulling backwards, it seemed that he wanted to remove Dahuang from Tian Linger pulled away. Feeling Tian Ling&rsquo;er&rsquo;s surprised gaze, Xiao Hui raised his head and suddenly grinned at Tian Ling&rsquo;er to grin.</p>
<p>Tian Ling&rsquo;er was not angry, and he also made a face at the monkey. Since Xiaohui followed Zhang Xiaofan, she could get along with other people. Latitude was very resentful to her, but when she saw that the rhubarb that had always been incompatible with Xiaohui turned her head, she didn’t get angry, but instead played with Xiaohui intimately. At that time, he was taken aback.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; Tian Linger asked Zhang Xiaofan, pointing at a monkey and a dog who were playing together.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan recounted the little things about Xiao Hui with a fleshy sleeve. Tian Ling&rsquo;er laughed out loud and said with curse: &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think of this dead monkey!&rdquo; He said with a bright eye, his eyes fell on Zhang Xiaofan and looked up and down. Yifan said, &ldquo;Oh, my father beat you today. Is there anything uncomfortable?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan shook his head and said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright, Sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Ling&rsquo;er said quite a bit indignantly: &ldquo;Daddy is really too, why do you feel angry if you feel uncomfortable!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan quickly said: &ldquo;No, it was me who was stupid to make Master angry&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Ling&rsquo;er glared at him, Zhang Xiaofan couldn&rsquo;t say anything, and he opened his mouth halfway. Tian Ling&rsquo;er snorted and said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really not your business at all. It&rsquo;s not that my father saw the two people&rsquo;s good qualifications and hearts.&rdquo; Unbalanced, so only&hellip;&rdquo; After half of the words, she glanced at Zhang Xiaofan. Isn&rsquo;t her heart saying that the younger brother was stupid, so she changed her tongue and digressed, saying: &ldquo;What happened to my mother just now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan honestly said: &ldquo;Sister-in-law came to visit me too, and gave me two &ldquo;Dai Huang Dan&rdquo;, very spiritual, I eat one and everything is fine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Da Huang Dan?&rdquo; Tian Ling&rsquo;er seemed taken aback.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Zhang Xiaofan looked up at her and said, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Ling&rsquo;er glanced at the little brother for a while, and said, &ldquo;This is my father&rsquo;s baby. Hearing from my mother that it was made from twenty-three Chinese medicines, it works wonderfully. None of my brothers including me I&rsquo;ve taken it before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan opened his mouth wide, Tian Ling&rsquo;er rolled his eyes, and said to himself: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s true that Dad actually looks at you differently, but it doesn&rsquo;t look like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan said: &ldquo;It must be Master&rsquo;s compassion. Seeing that I was injured, he blessed me with elixir. His old man is really broad-minded!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Ling&rsquo;er smiled: &ldquo;My father has a broad mind&hellip; Hey, forget it, don&rsquo;t tell you. Hey, how can there be rain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan listened to his ears, and he heard the sound of &ldquo;pickling&rdquo; rain coming from outside the house. Tian Ling&rsquo;er walked to the window and pushed the window open. A cold mountain breeze blew in immediately, with cold rain powder, and brushed his face, cool and silky.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan walked over and stood beside her, looking out.</p>
<p>In the silent and dark night, the sky was raining. The whole world is dark and dark, and only the blurred shadow of the bamboo in the small courtyard outside the house can be seen. Yusi fell from the night sky, in the dark night, in Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s eyes, it seemed to bring a little tenderness, even when he suddenly felt that the night was beautiful, the rain was entangled with mian, even the rain The crispness hitting the bamboo leaves is also beautiful, and it sounded deep in his soul.</p>
<p>Just because beside him, there was such a beautiful woman, with her head raised, with a seven-point youth, two-point joy, and even a desolate beauty, staring at it in amazement:</p>
<p>This rain!</p>
<p>Behind him, Rhubarb and Xiaohui do not know when to calm down. Rhubarb lay lazily on the bed, a pair of dog eyes half-opened, and Xiaohui also calmed down. He sat next to Rhubarb, his hands in the thick and soft fur of Rhubarb. Somehow.</p>
<p>The candlelight was swaying, suddenly and suddenly extinguished in the mountain breeze, and occasionally made a crackling sound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s raining.&rdquo; Tian Ling&rsquo;er suddenly and quietly said.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan responded: &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Ling&rsquo;er stared at the night again, slowly turned around and returned to the table, whispering: &ldquo;Xiaofan, close the window, it&rsquo;s a bit cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan nodded, closed the window, and turned back to see Tian Ling&rsquo;er seemingly absent-mindedly sitting at the table, took a small box from his arms, opened it under the lights, and looked closely.</p>
<p>The candlelight reflected in her charming and bright eyes, like two gentle but hot flames.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said, are these cool beads beautiful?&rdquo; Tian Ling&rsquo;er&rsquo;s eyes stayed on the soft and shiny beads, as if even the sound sounded erratic, like Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s heart, empty and slowly sinking. Go on.</p>
<p>He walked over, summoned all his courage, and exhausted all his energy to make him look so calm. Tian Ling&rsquo;er raised his head and looked at him, and suddenly realized that the eyes of this ordinary teacher at this moment were so bright, and even brought a trace of fanaticism and pain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Slap&rdquo;, she closed the box gently and asked softly, &ldquo;Xiaofan, what&rsquo;s wrong with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan lowered his head, silenced, and whispered: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine, Sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Ling&rsquo;er was strange in his heart, but he didn&rsquo;t think much. He stood up and said, &ldquo;Okay, late at night, I should go back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan stood up, Tian Ling&rsquo;er walked a few steps, suddenly stopped, turned back and smiled, and the beautiful face suddenly struck, hit Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s heart: &ldquo;Look at my memory, what do you want to do tonight I have forgotten.&rdquo; She said, she took out a thin piece of paper from her arms, densely written with small characters on it, and handed it to Zhang Xiaofan.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan took a few glances and immediately changed his face, losing his voice: &ldquo;Tai Chi Xuan Qing Dao Law! Sister, this&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Ling&rsquo;er gave him a blank look and said, &ldquo;What do you do so loudly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan hurriedly lowered his voice and said, &ldquo;Sister, this is the third layer of law, you&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me?&rdquo; Tian Linger snorted and said, &ldquo;I naturally want to pass it on to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was shocked and said, &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Ling&rsquo;er said: &ldquo;I know that Dad has always looked down on you, and I don&rsquo;t even know how to be angry with you today. Well, he didn&rsquo;t teach his apprentices and scolded you in turn, I can&rsquo;t see it anymore. You take this recipe, When you secretly practice yourself, when will you practice a famous place to see my father, don&rsquo;t be so embarrassed like today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan frowned tightly and said, &ldquo;But Sister, if they are known by the Master, do they want to scold you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Ling&rsquo;er said impatiently: &ldquo;You also said it was a scolding. They scolded me at most and shut me up for a while. What happened? I can&rsquo;t let you be bullied anyway!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was shocked all over, and his heart burst into heat, looking at Tian Ling&rsquo;er&rsquo;s pretty figure, he couldn&rsquo;t say a word. At this moment, his heart was full of blood, so that he would let him die for the woman in front of him, and he would never hesitate.</p>
<p>Tian Ling&rsquo;er again said: &ldquo;You remember to work harder and try to get a tie with Lin Jingyu, the stinky ass, as soon as you practice, you can&rsquo;t compare with Brother Qi Hao, then you don&rsquo;t need to think about it. &ldquo;At this point, she waved her hand and urged: &ldquo;Keep it secret.&rdquo; After walking out of the room, she quickly disappeared into darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t match Brother Qi Hao anymore!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thirteen words of this sentence, each one hit heavily in Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s heart, his face suddenly lost blood, subconsciously, grasped the blank sheet of paper in his hand.</p>
<p>The mountains and rain are clear, and the world is awe-inspiring. Who sees the young man in the night, walks into the rain, and looks up to the sky!</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>In the early morning, after the rain, the damp mountain breeze blew across the peak of Dazhu with a cool feeling. Zhang Xiaofan came to the familiar kitchen and fired water.</p>
<p>Firewood crackled across the stove, and the bright yellow flames resembled a demon dancing on the wood, reflecting his face. Zhang Xiaofan took a fine firewood as a fire stick, and fiddled with the firewood in the stove for a while, stunned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t match Brother Qi Hao anymore!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He recited this sentence thousands of times in his heart, and broke his heart every time he read it. He knew this was silly. Sister Sister was actually not malicious, but just told the facts that everyone recognized.</p>
<p>But he couldn&rsquo;t help but think desperately, just like there was such a wild burning flame in his heart, burning the mind endlessly until the flame burned his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oops!&rdquo; Zhang Xiaofan screamed and jumped back. It turned out that the fire was burning the fine wood in his hand when he was enchanted, and he burned his hand up the road.</p>
<p>He held his hands and blew towards the painful place, ran to the water tank and dipped his hands in the cold water, and a cold cold pours up. Zhang Xiaofan smiled lowly. What he needs most now is not a burning stick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Um, um, um&rdquo;, a few calls rang out at the door, Zhang Xiaofan heard the call of rhubarb, but just couldn&rsquo;t figure out how the usual &ldquo;Wang Wang Wang&rdquo; would become &ldquo;Well, well, well.&rdquo; He walked out of the door to see it, and smiled unconsciously. It turned out that Da Huang and Xiao Hui were making a fuss, and a black short rod was bitten in the mouth. The other end of the short rod was caught by Xiao Hui in the hand and pulled hard. The two sides could not dispute, and Da Huang called in his mouth. But biting the short stick was ambiguous, and it became a weird &ldquo;huh huh&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan stepped forward, reached for the short stick, waved away the little gray and rhubarb. Unexpectedly, they were not very willing, &ldquo;Wang Wang Wang&rdquo; &ldquo;squeak&rdquo; cried non-stop. Zhang Xiaofan waved his hands and threatened: &ldquo;Go, don&rsquo;t make trouble here, or you won&rsquo;t be given meals at noon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dahuang and Xiaohui glanced at each other, one growled, one made a grimace, and then Xiaohui jumped on the back of the dog, and Huanghuang walked away from Zhang Xiaofan in front of him, with great contempt, Zhang Xiaofan was angry.</p>
<p>After swearing at the two beasts, Zhang Xiaofan turned and entered the kitchen, only to realize that the short stick in his hand was the strange black short stick in the trip to the valley half a year ago. I don&rsquo;t know when I pulled this thing out of the corner and used it to play with rhubarb.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan sighed, suddenly moved his heart, and quickly walked to the edge of the stove, fiddled with the black short stick as a burning stick, it was very handy, and the stick did not know what the material was, the fire was not burning, and it did not transfer heat. , It’s still cold and baked for a long time. Zhang Xiaofan nodded again and again, thinking that this is just right to use.</p>
<p>Poor old black heart old man who passed away, if he knew the &ldquo;blood bite&rdquo; he spent all his life to make, the magic treasure of the world, fell to the point of making a fire stick, and he would be angry from the grave You must live and die again.</p>
<p>At noon this day, Dazhufeng all sat in the dining room, Tian Tian was not able to come in at the latest, sit in the position, looked up to the disciples, when his eyes fell on Zhang Xiaofan, he stopped, Zhang Xiaofan With his head lowered, Tian couldn&rsquo;t easily look away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see what happened yesterday?&rdquo; Tian was not easy to say lightly.</p>
<p>Everyone was silent, and only Song Daren said with a smile: &ldquo;Yes, Master showed great power and punished those two&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fart!&rdquo; Tian was not easy to shout suddenly, and the audience was shocked. Everyone was silent. Only Tian was not angry: &ldquo;What happened yesterday, you should see the profound practice of the brothers of the Biemai, don&rsquo;t say that Qi Hao. , Even the little guy who just started three years, actually surpassed most of you, ran to Dazhufeng to spread the wild. Do you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everyone was silent, only Zhang Xiaofan suddenly raised his head.</p>
<p>Tian was not cold and said coldly: &ldquo;The Seven Veins will be in a blink of an eye. You guys, who are not capable of doing things, will all retreat from today. They will not be repaired to the same level, and I will not peel your skin!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s face was bitter, but they didn&rsquo;t dare to say a word, Tian Linger asked cautiously: &ldquo;Dad, then I will&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are the same!&rdquo; Tian said hardly.</p>
<p>Tian Linger pouted at the corner of his mouth and was about to speak, but was secretly pulled by his mother. She turned her head to look at Su Ru&rsquo;s eyes, and then shrank back if she had come to her mouth.</p>
<p>Tian Nan’s words echoed in Shoujingtang: “In the future, except for the seventh elder who is responsible for eating and drinking, you will not be allowed to go out during this year and a half, retreat to practice, do you know?”</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>In this way, the time is rushing, and the calm atmosphere of Dazhufeng is covered with an unprecedented level of tension. All the disciples are devoted to practicing Taoism, except for a leisurely yellow dog, a naughty gray monkey and a Boring chef.</p>
