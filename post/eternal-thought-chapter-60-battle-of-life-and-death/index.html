      <p>This scene is too fast. In the room of electric light and flint, three members of the Luochen family with eight layers of gas condensate are killed immediately. The other two breathe. But they have no time to think about it and kill Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>White Xiaochun spilled blood from the corner of his mouth, shivered and fell back on the tree behind him. When the long sword in his chest was suddenly knocked out, he grabbed the sword with his right hand, pulled it out suddenly and swept towards one of them with a sword. At the same time, another family member of the Luochen family with eight layers of condensation gas was approaching. He pinched the formula with his right hand, which broke out vigorously.</p>
<p>With a bang, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s body flew up. In the air, his blood was sprayed, and his clothes became bloody. The two members of the Luochen family came after him at the same time. Seeing the crisis of life and death, Bai Xiaochun still did not despair. He had a strong desire to survive. When he pinched the formula, a long gun appeared, a big axe appeared, and two flying swords were taken by Bai Xiaochun at the same time Out.</p>
<p>With his skill of controlling tripod with purple Qi, he shot out fiercely.</p>
<p>The two members of the Luochen family changed their faces and used their skills. They turned into countless black fog, which immediately blocked the sound. When the impact spread, those magic weapons were scattered in all directions. Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s mouth was full of blood and staggered back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s time to end it!&rdquo; Two clansmen of eight layers of condensate came for the third time. This time, the speed was faster, and the cultivation power was at its peak. In the blink of an eye, they were going to kill Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Live, I want to live!&rdquo; He was crazy in his pure eyes, and his aura and oil were exhausted. He gave out a hoarse roar. In this roar, the weak spiritual power accumulated in countless subtle meridians and countless flesh and bones in his body over the years, like Baichuan Nahai, broke out in an all-round way.</p>
<p>Boom! Boom!</p>
<p>The aura in these subtle meridians had been loosened in Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s life and death wars before. At this critical moment, all of them finally woke up and poured into Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s main meridians. In a blink of an eye, they converged into a big river. As he swam around his body, bursts of crackling sound reverberated like a drum beating, and a lot of meridians were smashed.</p>
<p>At the same time, a wave of seven layers of condensate gas, in Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s body, suddenly burst out.</p>
<p>The two people who came to eight layers of condensate noticed the fluctuation of seven layers of gas condensate on Bai Xiaochun, and their faces changed greatly. Even in their eyes, they were shocked and unbelievable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Break through in battle!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This How can this be possible When they were shocked, Bai Xiaochun suddenly raised his head, and his eyes showed the essence. Although the extra spiritual power could not alleviate Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s injury, it made him run out of oil and light, and poured into the sweet and fresh again.</p>
<p>His body rushed out in a flash, and appeared directly in front of a person. In the exclamation of the Luo Chen people, all his right hands were dark, and the lock suddenly opened.</p>
<p>With a click, the eight layers of condensed gas can&rsquo;t dodge at all. They run straight to Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s right hand and are crushed by Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s neck.</p>
<p>Another person, his scalp was numb at the moment. Seeing that Bai Xiaochun looked at him, he immediately uttered a shrill voice. His body suddenly retreated. His eyes showed a strong fear. For Bai Xiaochun, he had been shocked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Save me, little Lord!&rdquo; As it retreats, the last eight layers of condensate make a sound of anxiety.</p>
<p>At the moment, Chen Heng is less than 30 Zhang away from here. Seeing this scene happen in front of him, he roars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want to die!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun didn&rsquo;t even look at Chen Heng. He pinched a finger with his right hand, and immediately those magic tools scattered around him trembled at this moment, sending out a strong buzz, as if responding to Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s call.</p>
<p>All of a sudden all fly up, the speed is faster than before too much, a flash straight straight to the moment has come, is about to approach here Chen Heng, to stop his footsteps.</p>
<p>The sound of banging reverberates and is blocked by those magic tools. Even if Chen Heng&rsquo;s cultivation of the ninth floor of condensate gas can&rsquo;t be destroyed instantly, it is blocked for a moment.</p>
<p>While Chen Heng is blocked, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s body flies out in a flash. He is close to the escaped people of eight layers of condensation gas. His eyes are full of murders and his fist blows away.</p>
<p>With a bang, the people of the eight layers of condensation gas spurted blood. They were about to continue to retreat, but they didn&rsquo;t see Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s left hand pinching the formula. A wooden sword came from behind the eight layers of condensation gas without a sound. In a flash, it penetrated the head of the eight layers of condensation gas, stained with fresh blood, and appeared in front of Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>The people with eight layers of condensation opened their eyes and looked at the whole world. With a bang, they fell to the ground and twitched several times. Their mouths were overflowing with blood. Soon, their eyes were dim and they died.</p>
<p>After all this, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s body falters. Although he has made a breakthrough in his cultivation, he has just spent all his accomplishments in this series of killing. At the moment, there is more blood in the corner of his mouth. His body suddenly retreats and escapes into the jungle again.</p>
<p>He knew that at the moment, there was only the last person left on the other side, and this person was also the strongest. Bai Xiaochun had already felt the cultivation of nine layers of condensate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Condensate layer 9&hellip;&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s heart is bitter and astringent, but he has a strong desire to survive. He knows that this time, it is not the other party&rsquo;s death, but his own death!</p>
<p>There is no third option.</p>
<p>Almost at the moment when he retreated, Chen Heng gave out a startling roar, and the blood mist of his whole body boomed and boomed. At this moment, all the magic weapons showed signs of fragmentation, and soon collapsed. In the blood mist, Chen Heng flew out in an instant. He was short of breath. He looked at the bodies of three people around him and gave out a more angry roar, with red eyes and facing Where Bai Xiaochun left, he ran after him.</p>
<p>One of them fled and the other pursued. In the jungle of the nameless mountains, they went farther and farther towards the depths. The sky thundered with thunder. Although it was daytime, the lightning could not be seen clearly, but the rain was getting bigger and bigger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you Shangguan Tianyou or LV Tianlei?&rdquo; Chen Heng with a murderous voice came out, he pinched Jue, around nine blood fog, like nine blood python, in front of him constantly shuttle, sometimes spit blood light straight to Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m your grandfather!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun was pale, but sensitive, and avoided many times. Seeing that the young master of the Luochen family was getting closer and closer behind him, Bai Xiaochun suddenly jumped up in a shiver and looked like he was going to gallop forward. At the moment when Chen Heng suddenly jumped behind him, Bai Xiaochun stepped on the big tree in front of him.</p>
<p>When the big tree shakes violently, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s body suddenly bounces up with the help of this force, turns around in mid air and runs straight to Chen Heng, who is chasing after him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No matter who you are, you are dead today!&rdquo; In Chen Heng&rsquo;s eyes, the opportunity flashed, and his right hand pinched the formula with a sudden wave. Nine blood boas around him, facing the coming Bai Xiaochun, opened his mouth and was about to swallow it.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s eyes turned red and roared. When he pinched the formula with both hands, little aura was released from his body. Immediately, a purple tripod suddenly appeared, enveloping his body. He was allowed to swallow the nine blood python, but the speed did not slow down. He roared all the way to Chen Heng.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little bit of work!&rdquo; Chen Heng sneered. The nine blood boas turned into fog in a twinkling of an eye, and formed a bloody skull floating on the top of his head, which directly collided with the purple tripod.</p>
<p>The thundering sound was so loud that the purple cauldron trembled. It broke into pieces at once. At last, it collapsed and exploded. Although the blood fog skeleton had dissipated most of the time, it was still there.</p>
<p>Almost at the moment when the impact came out, Bai Xiaochun rushed out of the collapsed tripod. In an instant, he shuttled through the broken tripod and ran straight to the fog below.</p>
<p>At the same time, Chen hengmu flashed in the mist. At the moment when the fog was thin, his body suddenly rushed up under the blood mist. When his right hand pinched the formula, his whole right hand was entangled in the fog, and a ferocious grimace appeared in his palm.</p>
<p>Just as he rushed out, he saw Bai Xiaochun face-to-face.</p>
<p>The two men looked at each other, and directly touched each other. One was a fist, one was a palm, the other was a black light shining, the undead iron broke out, the other was the magic technique and the grimace was ferocious.</p>
<p>The sound was deafening. When it suddenly came out, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s blood spurted out, and the whole body heard the sound of slapping. The whole person, like a kite with broken lines, broke a lot of branches along the way.</p>
<p>Chen Heng&rsquo;s body was shocked. His face was pale and his blood was rolling. He was also shocked by Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s strength. At the moment, his body flew out and caught up with Bai Xiaochun. When his right hand was raised, the fog around him spread rapidly, covering more than ten Zhang, forming a huge face. He suppressed Bai Xiaochun with him.</p>
<p>In his eyes, Bai Xiaochun shows his ferocity after being forced to the edge of death. His body twists violently in the air. When he turns around, his right hand suddenly lifts up and points to Chen Heng. Under this finger, his purple Qi controlling Ding skill suddenly breaks out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not to control objects, but to control Chen Heng&rsquo;s body. Chen Heng has never heard of this usage. He immediately feels a strong force around him. If he has an invisible palm, he should grasp his body.</p>
<p>Chen Heng sneers, and the cultivation spreads rapidly. Behind him, the bloody face gives out a low roar, and the click echoes. Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s aura is directly disconnected, but Chen Heng&rsquo;s body is slightly shocked.</p>
<p>At the moment of his meal, the wooden sword roars away and goes straight to Chen Heng. At the same time, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s body also rushes out. At any cost, his whole body is immortal, and the iron sheet moves and roars away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ridiculous!&rdquo; Chen Heng&rsquo;s sleeve swung, and the bloody face behind him penetrated his body and suppressed it downward. In the roar, he touched the wooden sword. The wooden sword trembled, but it did not collapse. Instead, he penetrated the bloody face and made a gap.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s body along the gap, with the undead iron sheet, fighting for injury, directly rushed out, Chen Heng&rsquo;s eyes flash, right hand pinch Jue again.</p>
<p>Immediately there is a curved blood light, such as a machete, straight to Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>In a flash, the arc-shaped blood light directly fell from Bai Xiaochun. Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s chest was covered with blood and flesh, but his fist, which was concentrated in his whole body, fell with the same blow.</p>
<p>When the loud noise came out, Chen Heng was shocked. He stepped back a few steps and looked pale. However, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s attack did not end. His speed was almost overdrawn at this moment. It was not fatal Full blown out.</p>
<p>Boom! Boom!</p>
