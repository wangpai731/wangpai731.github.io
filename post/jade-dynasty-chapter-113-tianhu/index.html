      <p>The fire beast looked up at the small ash surrounded by the golden awn in the air. After a while, the whole hall suddenly roared, and the temperature suddenly rose, just like the sea of fire.</p>
<p>In the roar, his attention was obviously shifted from the fierce side to Xiaohui. He stepped on the ground with all his arms and legs and jumped up to Xiaohui. Its whole body is ablaze with flames, even the mysterious flame totem diaphragm that is constantly rotating behind it is as bright as a fire.</p>
<p>Under the pressure of the overwhelming fire light, the golden light from Xiaohui was suppressed for a moment, and the flame rushed up crazily, which was about to swallow up Xiaohui.</p>
<p>Just at this critical moment, a figure stood in front of the little grey body, which was just a ghost. I saw him rise up and float in front of the little grey body. Under the urging of his real method, the black soul eating magic wand brightened up and gave off a dark green luster, which was mixed with light blood.</p>
<p>In a moment, the huge head of the beast had already rushed to Gui Li. Facing such a fierce monster, GUI Li could even see the sharp teeth in his big mouth.</p>
<p>Deep, breathe!</p>
<p>In the flying sparks, a word of Buddhist truth suddenly appeared three feet in front of Guili. It was golden. A moment later, he saw a flash of blue air on his face, just before the Giant Claw of a different beast came to the truth, and the golden light on the truth was at the same time light blue.</p>
<p>Since the founding of Qingyun gate and Tianyin temple, the two truths of &ldquo;great Brahma Prajna&rdquo; and &ldquo;taijixuanqingdao&rdquo; have been applied simultaneously for the first time.</p>
<p>All over the sky, like mountains and seas!</p>
<p>The beast roared and roared, and attacked with one hand. The power of the great fire beats on the truth, and in an instant, it bursts out the incomparable brilliance from the intersection. The mountain like flame suddenly flew back, and the huge beast was bounced back by Sheng Sheng. The whole hall was shaken by invisible power.</p>
<p>The flame beast fell back to the ground, as if it was also shocked. Suddenly, it raised its head and looked at the figure in front of it with a pair of huge eyes burning with flame.</p>
<p>The truth is that the golden awn is fading, and then it disappears into the air. The ghostly body fell down. The foot touch the ground, can not help but a stagger, face brush of white.</p>
<p>The soul slowly flew down and stopped in front of the master floating. In the light of the fire on the opposite side, there is still a dark green light.</p>
<p>The corners of his mouth twitched slightly, then he held back, but after a while he moved again, finally shaking his shoulders.</p>
<p>Wow, a mouthful of blood came out. The bright red blood seemed to turn into a red mist, floating in front of him.</p>
<p>Just like many years ago, that miserable and sad rain!</p>
<p>Little by little, the blood wrapped the black stick. The once &ldquo;fire stick&rdquo; quietly swallowed every drop of blood and sucked it into the stick without leaving any trace.</p>
<p>On the bloody bead, the red light gradually brightens.</p>
<p>Cold feeling all over the body.</p>
<p>From the violence that has just been tolerated, we can no longer suppress it. We scream at the sky, our eyes are red. In an instant, thousands of thoughts in my mind turned around, and endless blood and bones came to haunt him like a nightmare. Shaking hands slowly clenched with strength, as if they could no longer bear the blood boiling all over the body because of blood!</p>
<p>In front of him, the eight monsters on the Fire Totem behind the beast also flickered, as if echoing the smell of bloody killing on him.</p>
<p>At this moment, it seems that the ghost and the fierce beast have turned into a cruel beast, confronting each other with the flame beast in front. The hall was blazing, and even the air seemed to be burning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roar!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly. The flame beast roared, as if for the first time there was a little uneasiness.</p>
<p>The ash in the air fell down in front of the ghost.</p>
<p>The eyes on his forehead were glittering with gold, and the sound of &ldquo;kakaca&rdquo; bone joint shaking and beating was heard at the same time from countless places on the small ash body. Then, under the gaze of the ghost and the flame beast. Little grey began to change.</p>
<p>Originally, the thin body suddenly bulged with numerous thick and strong muscles. In the sound of bone knots, the body of Xiaohui slowly grew larger. At such a clear moment when the human eye can see, a monkey that is less than half the height of a human is growing rapidly in the rapidly increasing muscles and bones. In a flash, it has surpassed the ghostly body.</p>
<p>One by one muscles bulged in the small gray arms, chest and abdomen. The head becomes larger, and there are even long and sharp fangs in the mouth, which radiate cold light and protrude outside the mouth. The palm, originally used to pick fruits, has produced sharp claws.</p>
<p>Finally, when the monkey turned into a fierce beast almost the same height as the fire beast, it slowly opened its eyes, the eyes under the third eye.</p>
<p>Red and bloodshot eyes, mingled with a golden light, stand out.</p>
<p>The original vast altar hall, now suddenly there are two so huge monsters, crowded. Little gray&rsquo;s eyes were full of fierce light, staring at the flame beast opposite, and his mouth kept roaring.</p>
<p>The fire beast giant slowly turned, and all he could see in his eyes was the fire, without any expression. But it can be seen that it is also a little afraid in the face of this huge fierce monkey that has suddenly transformed.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the little gray roared, and the third eye with the golden light was suddenly bright. A bunch of golden light rushed out. The flame beast roared and let go.</p>
<p>The golden light hit on the ground with a roar, which immediately hit the hard red rock out of a big pit.</p>
<p>Before the fire beast could react, the ghost who had been standing behind the ash had risen up. Suddenly, his whole body was covered with a strange light, and the ghost eating magic stick in front of him rushed towards the fire beast.</p>
<p>Almost at the same time, small ash also follows to the flame beast.</p>
<p>The flame in the eyes of the fire beast is extremely hot</p>
<p>All of a sudden, when GUI Li, who was filled with blood, was trying to attack the beast in the opposite direction with all his strength, the xuanhuojian on his right arm seemed to wake up suddenly and burst out a strong and incomparable pure Yang, far more than ever before, rushing towards the blood bead filled in the body meridians of GUI Li.</p>
<p>The body was shocked, and the face was almost instantly pale. The body flying in the mid air is like being hit by a huge force. It only feels like there are tens of millions of sharp blades stabbing into the flesh and blood of the body in a moment. The pure Yang force in his body seemed to be stimulated by the cold and violent Qi of blood beads. It turned into the extremely hot burning fire, which was full of every meridian in his body, fighting with the Yin and ice Qi of blood beads.</p>
<p>His whole body broke down in a flash, and the whole man fell powerlessly from the sky and fell heavily to the ground. And half of the devouring soul that flies loses its master&rsquo;s urging, is immediately like spirituality. He flew backward and fell on him with a bang.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Squeak&hellip;&rdquo; Xiaohui&rsquo;s three eyes looked over at the same time and roared loudly in his mouth. Obviously, he couldn&rsquo;t imagine why it was so suddenly.</p>
<p>But almost at the same time. The flame beast on the opposite side started to move. Hovering over the totem circle of fire behind the fire beast, one of the eight monsters suddenly flashes. With the roar of the fire beast, they rush forward.</p>
<p>The fierce light seemed to be like a living thing. It came rushing with it.</p>
<p>Little ash roared. A huge body sprang up. Two huge monsters collided in the middle of the sky, and then fell to the ground again. The whole hall vibrated.</p>
<p>The burning flame was burning like a sea of mountains. Xiaohui&rsquo;s strong body was on fire for several times, but it seemed to ignore the pain of the flame. He grabbed it with one claw and hit it hard on the head of the flame beast, but almost at the same time, his belly was also severely hit by his opponent.</p>
<p>At the same time, the two monsters roared in pain. After a while, they were entangled and fighting together. The huge body turned into a terrible volcano, and every heavy blow made the sky full of blood.</p>
<p>He was lying on the ground powerless, suffering from the sudden great pain, unable to move. His eyes were red with blood, but somehow, he suddenly woke up in his mind.</p>
<p>All the fighting sounds are far away. The blazing light of the burning flame seems to be far away from the sky. The incomparable pain in the body erodes every inch of the skin. His eyes clearly saw in the blood light that the ferocious light in the half sky was manipulated by the strange force as if it was ferocious towards him.</p>
<p>But he had no fear!</p>
<p>In a moment, how long is that?</p>
<p>The edge of life and death. What do you think of?</p>
<p>Is it the drizzling night rain in Zhushan many years ago? Or the pale figure beside you when you fall into the endless abyss?</p>
<p>Trance between the original see before, the first face of the light smile</p>
<p>He closed his eyes slowly.</p>
<p>Are you going to die? Then die!</p>
<p>This life is very tired!</p>
<p>The next moment, the boundless darkness with a deep sense of ferocity. Over him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bang!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The powerful force directly hit the body from the ground and flew back. The light of ferocity turned into a grim smile and attached to him. With a hiss, he tore his clothes, opened his mouth, and was about to bite his neck.</p>
<p>The little grey who was fighting with the fire beast heard the sound. Looking back, his eyes were wide open in an instant, his eyes were split, and blood flowed down his face. He was almost as bloody as a ghost of Jiuyou, making a shrill scream.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know where the power came from. I saw the red light in the little gray eyes was about to bleed. In the roar, Sheng Sheng threw away the fire beast.</p>
<p>But almost at the same time, the claws of the flame beast opened a huge wound in its abdomen, and blood gushed out like a raging wave.</p>
<p>But Xiaohui didn&rsquo;t take a look at her. She went back to the direction of the ghost.</p>
<p>The man haunted by ferocious spirits!</p>
<p>Now reflected in its red eyes like blood</p>
<p>The original close distance, will it be the end of the world?</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>The wind is howling.</p>
<p>There are fierce thoughts.</p>
<p>The fierce God&rsquo;s sharp teeth bit on the fierce neck. The little ash, which was still a few feet away, gave out a desperate sob and roar.</p>
<p>A light red light, suddenly from the fierce rags revealed. Somehow, the ferocious light seemed to freeze and stay still.</p>
<p>Xuanhuojian!</p>
<p>The ancient Fire Totem wrapped in green jade ring slowly lights up at the moment, sending out a red light, shining on the fierce light image.</p>
<p>Almost no resistance, &ldquo;hiss&rdquo;, just a ferocious and ferocious light like, was absorbed by xuanhuojian like a long whale, and disappeared in a flash.</p>
<p>A moment later, Xiaohui pours on Guili, but before he can check the injury carefully, the wind behind him is loud, and the flame beast pours up again.</p>
<p>At the wound of Xiaohui&rsquo;s abdomen, the blood gushed out like a spring. It can be seen that its action has been a little hard, but subconsciously, Xiaohui is still in front of the unconscious ghost.</p>
<p>However, the flame beast suddenly stopped, and the huge head slowly turned. The flaming eyes fell on the black fire sign tied to the right arm of the ghost.</p>
<p>The ancient totem of fire, with the red light of confusion, seems to be telling something.</p>
<p>Little grey watched the fire beast warily.</p>
<p>But the beast suddenly seems to be very strange, it seems to be unbelievable. Looking at the xuanhuojian, the ghost and the ash, the huge head is rotating, which seems to be a little fidgety and growls incessantly.</p>
<p>A moment later. It seems that there is something irresistible at last. Suddenly, the two front legs of the flame beast bend down, the body falls down, and the huge head slowly points to the dark fire Jian for three times. Then a low roar comes out. The flame on the whole body suddenly darkens, and all the flames disappear one by one. Finally, even the body of the giant beast slowly dissipates in this space. And in the middle of the sky, the totem of fire with the eight patterns of ferocity lost the fire beast. It also disappeared slowly.</p>
<p>The whole hall was suddenly quiet.</p>
<p>All the fierce flames disappeared, and the hall was once again shrouded in a faint red light emanating from the volcano well, only on the top of the head. Where the fire beast just appeared, a round hole leading to the second floor was exposed.</p>
<p>Xiaohui low cried, slowly sitting on the ground, sitting beside the ghost, silently looking at the master, and then. Then I looked at the huge wound on my stomach.</p>
<p>It waited in silence.</p>
<p>The pain faded away and the instinct of life pulled him out of the darkness.</p>
<p>Ghost Li slowly opened his eyes.</p>
<p>The great pain was like an invisible fire, which had just burned on every inch of his body, leaving no trace. But it&rsquo;s exhausted him.</p>
<p>He breathed deeply, his tentacles were cold, and the &ldquo;fire stick&rdquo; was still by his hand, accompanying him.</p>
<p>Fire stick</p>
<p>All of a sudden, he chuckled and squeaked. Ghost Li turns to see, small ash is lying beside him. Look at yourself. Just now, the huge body has changed back. It&rsquo;s the little monkey nestling in his hand again. It&rsquo;s just the blood stained wound on its abdomen, and the third eye shining with a light golden light on its forehead, all reminding him of what happened just now.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, ghost Li smiles and slowly sits up to Xiaohui, reaching out to touch his head. Little gray grinned, squeaked twice, and grabbed his head with his hand.</p>
<p>The red light in the main hall flows gently and shines on their figures.</p>
<p>The ghost Li checks the whole body secretly, only feels the body tired, but the internal meridians in the body seem to be OK after that incredible internal fight. I just can&rsquo;t figure out why xuanhuojian, which has always been gentle and pure, suddenly became so violent. It seems that it has something to do with the XuanHuo altar and the strange ferocious array just now.</p>
<p>After finishing the torn clothes on his body, ghost Li pulled off a piece of cloth, picked up the ash and carefully bound up the wound on his stomach. Xiaohui looks down and blinks with three eyes. Looking at a circle of belt like things on his stomach, he squeaks twice. He seems curious and keeps touching it.</p>
<p>At this moment, the spirit and strength gradually recovered, holding the small ash, stood up and looked around. I can only see that there are many scars in the surrounding hall, and the traces of drama fighting can be seen everywhere, but somehow the traces are mostly on the ground, but there are not many on the wall.</p>
<p>At the same time, the circle of stone carvings of ferocity under my feet is calm and vivid.</p>
<p>He stood and pondered for a moment. He didn&rsquo;t know how long he had been in the XuanHuo altar for a while, but it&rsquo;s obvious that the senior official guarding here hasn&rsquo;t come back yet. It&rsquo;s because he knew that the XuanHuo altar was guarded by fire beasts that he dared to leave!</p>
<p>Then his eyes fell on the round hole leading to the second floor above his head.</p>
<p>The red light on the main hall also drifted up a little, but from below, you can only see a small part of the cave entrance, and it seems that there is also darkness beside it.</p>
<p>Ghost Li looked at the darkness, and suddenly said to little ash, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go up and have a look! How are you doing? &quot;</p>
<p>Little ash grinned in his arms.</p>
<p>Ghost Li gently touched its head, then put the ash on his shoulder, then inhaled deeply, the whole person slowly floated up, left the ground, and flew to the hole.</p>
<p>He ascended slowly and carefully. No one knows if there is any monster guarding the mysterious altar. But there was silence until he floated to the second altar and was not attacked.</p>
<p>In the second layer of altar, except for the round hole coming up, there is a light red light. It&rsquo;s dark all around, but in the dark, there&rsquo;s another thing that emits light.</p>
<p>GUI Li went there.</p>
<p>It was a stone platform more than half a man high, in the shape of a cylinder. The whole stone is quite different from the red rock around it. It emits a light coolness. At the same time, the shimmer from the stone column is constantly changing colors, sometimes reddish, sometimes lavender, sometimes yellow, sometimes green. It&rsquo;s very beautiful.</p>
<p>On the plane of the stone platform. There is a circular dent with three words engraved on the side</p>
<p>Xuanhuojian!</p>
<p>The ghostly eyes suddenly fell to the right arm, and some of the torn clothes showed the ancient flame totem of xuanhuojian.</p>
<p>He gently untied the treasure, stared at it for a moment, and then put it into the dent. It was perfect.</p>
<p>A moment later, a dull voice came from above. Ghost Li and small ash look up at the same time, only to see the top of the slate. In the low voice, a cave appeared.</p>
<p>Almost at the same time, the temperature of the surrounding area suddenly fell, and it became cold from the original extreme heat. Against the faint red light, you can even see the cold white air floating down from the round hole leading to the third floor.</p>
<p>The hot and cold Qi can exist in the XuanHuo altar at the same time!</p>
<p>With a faint smile on his lips, he took xuanhuojian back from the stone platform, put it in his arms, said nothing more, and flew to the highest level again.</p>
<p>The air around is getting colder and colder, and the hot gas in the lower crater doesn&rsquo;t seem to affect it at all. As a result, when GUI Li stepped on the third floor of the ground, he found that there was thick ice under his feet.</p>
<p>There is nothing shining here, but after the ghostly eyes slowly adapted to the surroundings, they found a faint light of light blue. From every corner.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the ice that has coagulated for many years, as if it&rsquo;s telling something gently.</p>
<p>He walked slowly forward, and the sound of footsteps on the ice drifted away, breaking the ancient silence here.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, a low and slightly surprised, soft and a hint of desolation of the woman&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not the best policy of the government?&rdquo; it sounded in the dark</p>
<p>Ghost Li immediately stopped body, after a moment, his eyes tightly stare at the darkest depth ahead, slowly way: &ldquo;I am not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The voice was silent for a while and slowly said, &ldquo;who are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; he asked</p>
<p>The blue light from the solid ice around seemed to flash, and the woman&rsquo;s voice was silent. A moment later, two groups of dim light seemed to be endless and deep pupils, twinkling and twinkling in the darkest place, gazing at GUI Li and the little ash on his shoulder.</p>
<p>At last, it fell into his hands again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The monkey on your shoulder is a three eyed monkey, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In his heart, ghost Li did not answer. Instead, the little gray teeth on his shoulder shouted to the dark depth, as if he was demonstrating.</p>
<p>The woman didn&rsquo;t care, and slowly said, &ldquo;that magic weapon in your hand, but it&rsquo;s melted by the&rdquo; blood melting method &ldquo;of the demon cult, which is&rdquo; blood eating beads &ldquo;and&rdquo; soul taking &ldquo;of ghosts?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ghost Li body a shock, the pupil contracts.</p>
<p>The woman&rsquo;s voice seemed to smile softly and said slowly: &ldquo;soul taking and blood eating beads are the most dangerous and evil things in the world, especially blood eating beads, which contain violent and evil forces and invade people&rsquo;s souls. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s low, but the evil force has been deeply embedded in the body, and sooner or later you will die of madness. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kind of person are you?&rdquo; said GUI Li coldly</p>
<p>The woman ignored him and said to herself, &ldquo;although the monkey beside you is called the spirit of all things, and the sky&rsquo;s eye is open at the moment, but I think it has a red fierce light under the golden light. It must be because it&rsquo;s accompanied by you and attacked by the power of blood eating beads. It&rsquo;s better to change its name to&rdquo; three eyed fierce monkey &ldquo;if it&rsquo;s also a fierce animal killing animals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a big shock in the ghost&rsquo;s heart and he couldn&rsquo;t speak for a moment. He gradually found out the strange appearance of Xiaohui&rsquo;s body, but now he was so clearly and clearly said by the mysterious woman that he was at a loss for a moment.</p>
<p>It was little ash, angry, hissing and screaming, with sharp teeth in the dark.</p>
<p>The woman&rsquo;s voice suddenly smiled, and youyou said: &ldquo;you are angry, hehe, why? We are all born creatures. You know me and I know you. Why do you want to be greedy for the prosperous human relationship in the world? &quot;</p>
<p>The ghost Li recovers the mood, calms the mind, the vision is gradually cold, the devouring spirit at hand also gradually spreads the dark green light, coldly says: &ldquo;you do not appear again, but I am not polite!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman&rsquo;s voice hummed and said, &ldquo;you are not a disciple of the burning incense Valley, but you can go to the third level of the XuanHuo altar. You have some skills indeed. Is the senior officer dead? But even if he&rsquo;s not there, you can break through the &ldquo;eight murderous XuanHuo array&rdquo; guarded by the &ldquo;red flame beast&rdquo;&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p>
<p>All of a sudden, the woman&rsquo;s voice suddenly sharpened. It seemed that she suddenly thought of something. There was a trace of excitement in her voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no matter how good you are, there are only Only xuanhuojian can open this altar on three levels. You, you have the xuanhuojian? &quot;</p>
<p>At the end of the speech, it seemed to set off her excited voice. At the same time, the strong ice around her suddenly lit up with blue light.</p>
<p>The ghost Li eyebrow head a wrinkly, but not wait for him to respond, that pair of dim eyes in the dark, already fell to his bosom that reveals a horn of Xuan fire on the Jian.</p>
<p>The ancient Fire Totem seems to be burning slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Xuanhuojian!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A sharp long roar, the woman &rsquo;s voice instantly high, mixed with countless pain, surprise, sadness, despair, and a trace of desolation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, why is xuanhuojian on you? How about sixth? What about Xiaoliu&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>She shrieked as if she had lost her mind.</p>
<p>On the third mysterious layer of XuanHuo altar, in the dark, suddenly blue light broke out, and countless shadows danced under the light blue light, restless in the gap between the dark and the light.</p>
<p>A figure, like flying out of the dark abyss, like coming from the ancient desolation, like a huge shadow like a demon, dancing in this space.</p>
<p>Ghost Li was stunned. Even if he saw the most terrible thing, he was ready for it. But when he saw the figure in front of him, he was still stunned.</p>
<p>The memory of a long time surged into his heart and filled his mind. Even Xiaohui screamed in front of him on his shoulder.</p>
<p>Behind that figure, there are nine shadows flying like a nightmare.</p>
<p>He slowly, slowly, astringent voice way: &ldquo;nine tail day fox!&rdquo;</p>
<p>…… (to be continued. )</p>
