      <p>The wind passes through the dead water.</p>
<p>At the foot of the water grass fluttering, water ripples, at a glance, boundless, although no one angry, but another moving scenery.</p>
<p>Soul devouring sends out a light dark blue light. The light flows and stops in the middle of the sky. Ghost Li body in its, hand and stand, staring at the front.</p>
<p>This day is a rare good weather in the dead river. Under the warm sunshine, the gloom of the past also dissipated a lot. However, just ten feet ahead of him, there was a thick gray, like a huge miasma like fog. It rose in a mighty way. It stretched from left to right. It was difficult to see the top. It was entangled and surging with each other, as if there was no boundary.</p>
<p>Here, is one of the most dangerous boundaries in the world where the death of zenezer!</p>
<p>The little grey monkey lying on his shoulder seemed to cry uneasily.</p>
<p>The ghost Li reached out and patted the small ash gently. The small ash calmed down. At the same time, a pair of smart eyes looked at the miasma in front. At this time, behind him suddenly sounded a whistling, a light such as electricity.</p>
<p>The body of the ghost is moving. If the soul devours his mind, it slowly turns around.</p>
<p>The light suddenly stopped in front of him. A young man came from Yukong. His sword eyebrows went into his temples and his eyes were bright and sharp. He came to the ghost in front of him and said, &ldquo;vice patriarch, everything has been arranged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ghost and Li don&rsquo;t ask him anything. They must have known it for a long time. Then they nodded slightly and said, &ldquo;OK, I&rsquo;ll give it to you here.&rdquo; Said, he seems to think of something, said: &ldquo;Yan back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; said the man called Yan Hui</p>
<p>Ghost Li looked behind him and said: &ldquo;you have always been calm, I am very relieved, but the killing monk has a violent temper and is too murderous. At present, all forces in the dead area are together, let alone act rashly. You should restrain him well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yan Hui smiled and said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t worry, vice patriarch, although killing is arrogant. But I never dare to disobey your orders, and I will restrain him. &quot;</p>
<p>Grimace looked at him, nodded, and was about to turn. &ldquo;There is another thing,&rdquo; Yan replied suddenly</p>
<p>Ghost Li looks at him, Yan Hui ponders for a moment, urges the magic weapon under his feet, approaches ghost Li. At the same time, he lowered his voice: &ldquo;just now I received the news from the main hall. Two of the four holy envoys, Qinglong and Zhuque, suddenly came to the direction of zuoze a few days ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His face changed a little, but then as usual, he kept silent for a while and said, &ldquo;this matter doesn&rsquo;t need to be publicized. You also act as usual and watch it change.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Yan</p>
<p>After that, he saluted the ghost and went back.</p>
<p>Ghost Li watched Yan Hui disappear and slowly turned around. His eyes fell on the huge miasma in front of him again, and suddenly he said: &ldquo;little ash, let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohui lies on his shoulder. Monkey claws reach out and grab his head. &ldquo;Squeak&rdquo; twice.</p>
<p>With a little smile, the ghost light is shining. One man and one monkey are melting in the dark green light. They move forward in the air and rush into the huge miasma.</p>
<p>In the miasma, the surrounding light disappears instantly. There was no trace of the original bright sky, but only a miasma of Gray was left around. As far as the eyes could reach, it could not be seen half a Zhang away.</p>
<p>Almost at the same time that the ghost and the fierce enter the miasma. The dark green light of soul devouring is very bright. It billows from the bottom to the top, forming a circle of light. It firmly protects the ghost and the ash. The miasma around is not only surging, but it can&rsquo;t invade this circle for half a minute.</p>
<p>Look out from the inside. As the spirit soared, the miasma around was like a cloud. It separated from the front and condensed behind. At the foot of the head, it was full of the gray miasma.</p>
<p>This one flies, unexpectedly is to gallop for a long time, ghostly fierce facial expression gradually dignified. The extremely poisonous miasma wall is the most obvious boundary between the inner and the outer of the death swamp. Although the outer is full of bottomless pits, if you are careful, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. But when you come to the inner, others don&rsquo;t say, only the miasma is extremely poisonous. If you touch it, you will hold your breath. But as long as your skin touches the extremely poisonous things, it will last for a while Carve poison gas to also invade into, attack heart and die.</p>
<p>Although Guili is now a successful Taoist, far from the little disciple on Qingyun Mountain, he still dare not take such poisons lightly. In the dead area, there are many opportunities to kill. Especially in this area, it&rsquo;s an ancient and wild place. It&rsquo;s dangerous and unpredictable. Now I&rsquo;m going to be careful and move forward cautiously.</p>
<p>But the miasma wall was extremely thick, and it flew for a while, and it was still there, and the surrounding was even more gray. According to his own calculation, the ghost and Li are scared secretly. At least they have been flying out of the wild and evil land. The miasma is eternal. Even if there is any strange treasure born here, no one can know it for thousands of years, let alone get it.</p>
<p>He thought about it in his heart, but the light of soul devouring was more and more abundant. The gray miasma around him was not only surging, but also seemed to speed up.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, the spirit suddenly jumped. There was a blue light in the miasma in front of him, but it just disappeared. The color is light, but somehow, I am familiar with it.</p>
<p>Almost at the same time, the miasma around the original quietly turned up rapidly, such as the boiling water in the pot, suddenly boiling.</p>
<p>Up and down left and right, the gray miasma began to rotate wildly, numerous or large or small miasma whirlpools suddenly appeared in front, there was a subtle pulling force, from four sides and eight directions. The little ash on his shoulder did not dare to move. He cried softly &ldquo;squeak&rdquo; in his mouth and tightly grasped his clothes.</p>
<p>The face of the ghost was as heavy as water, but the brow was deeply wrinkled. Suddenly, the whole body was tense. In the blue light of the soul devouring, a golden light rose rapidly, which reflected with the blue light. At once, the miasma around was forced back a few minutes. At the same time, the soul devouring broke through the air, as if it ignored the danger ahead. In the biggest miasma vortex ahead, Sheng rushed in.</p>
<p>As soon as the figure entered the huge miasma whirlpool, ghost Li Deng felt that the pulling force around him increased dramatically, and the wind was howling, and came from all directions in succession. It was full of miasma. When ghost Li&rsquo;s face turned white, he was pulled up by the huge natural force and flew straight to the sky.</p>
<p>For a moment, the wind blows fiercely, wordy and billowing, like the fury of the wind god. GUI Li is in the middle of the sky, breathing deeply. Suddenly, his hands come out together. His left hand is stamped. His right hand is the formula. The gold and Green Qi on his face rise together. In a moment, they flash again and again. If the right person is here, he can&rsquo;t speak at the moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Taijixuanqingdao&rdquo; of Qingyun gate and &ldquo;Dafan Prajna&rdquo; of Tianyin temple. Even in this young man, perfectly integrated!</p>
<p>In the brilliant golden and green brilliance, the soul devouring suddenly stabilizes and no longer floats with the wind. I stopped in the storm and watched it intensely, but the storm was getting fiercer and fiercer around me. The clouds were steaming and angry, and I could see it in front of me. It&rsquo;s gray everywhere.</p>
<p>For a moment, the ghost ponders, and finally knows that this is a fierce place, which can&rsquo;t be kept for a long time. At the moment, it drives the soul devouring and rushes towards the edge of the whirling storm. At the moment, after the roar of the ears and eyes and the whirling of the sky, it finally rushes out of the storm eye hidden in the calm miasma.</p>
<p>The force of his rush was very important. After leaving the miasma vortex, he rushed far away from the front, only to be disturbed just now.</p>
<p>The sky is spinning, and at this moment, although the miasma around is gradually calming down, the ghost&rsquo;s eyebrows are wrinkling, and he doesn&rsquo;t know whether he is going in the wrong direction.</p>
<p>When he was meditating, suddenly the little gray on his shoulder suddenly shrieked a warning, which was a sharp surprise, but he could not look at it carefully. He almost unconsciously moved his body three feet away from the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roar!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Among the gray clouds, a huge black thing swept by, sweeping past the place where he had just stood. There was a strong smell. Even the soul devouring diaphragm could not resist it. It came in faintly.</p>
<p>A moment later, the strange thing disappeared into the miasma.</p>
<p>Ghost Li was stunned. All of a sudden, his heart beat violently. This huge thing appeared in an instant, but it seemed to hit him in the head. At the next moment, despite the squeak and scream of little ash, he ran after him regardless of the great danger.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that the monster didn&rsquo;t blink. Although the body is huge and inconceivable, the speed is not slow. With the thick miasma wall, the sight can&rsquo;t reach half a Zhang, and the monster&rsquo;s shadow can&rsquo;t be found in a moment.</p>
<p>With a sharp frown, he stopped slowly. He was staring. Suddenly, he was in front of him. There was a scream. Then there were several people in front of him. I thought that the monster would pass by and disperse all of them.</p>
<p>The spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the</p>
<p>Before the voice fell, a fierce blue light suddenly came from the side. When the chest stabbed, like a rainbow across the sky, the miasma around suddenly also shone blue.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a surprise to the ghost. This man&rsquo;s sword skill is fierce. He never moves forward. He will not be merciful when he sets foot on it. Only the high level of his sword skill can&rsquo;t be underestimated. In a critical time, his body is moving forward fast, as fast as electricity, flying straight to the sky. He needs to get rid of the sword behind him and fight back.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the man in the cloud is very important. At the moment, they are separated by miasma and can&rsquo;t see each other clearly. However, with the help of the induction on the sword, the blue light, like spirituality, chases quickly, like bone attaching. The distance between them is not slightly reduced.</p>
<p>In a moment, the miasma in the neighborhood suddenly turned and turned into a faint blue light. Behind it, there was a blue light. The two sides went to the earth and moved, like electricity, like light. In this layer of toxic gas, they chased and chased each other. Where they passed, the clouds and mist were steaming.</p>
<p>In the process of pursuing, the ghost and the fierce brow are locked tightly. The humanity behind her is extremely high, and she can&rsquo;t see what magic weapon she uses urgently. However, the murderous spirit is clear and unmistakable. She is definitely not the same person, and most of them are the right people who are sworn to be irreconcilable with her.</p>
<p>Under the main road, which is the most powerful person?</p>
<p>His heart was still moving, but he had already begun to fight back. Otherwise, if he pursued like this all the time, it would be OK for the man behind him, but he would rush like a fly without a head. Who knows what else would happen?</p>
<p>I saw that the green light was suddenly full, the ghost body suddenly rose up, turned back in the middle of the sky, devoured the soul, and lay across my chest. The blue blade behind me also seems to feel something. The blade rises sharply and the momentum is more fierce. It comes from the chest.</p>
<p>The ghost grabs the soul in front of him. The blue bead on the black stick is shining. Especially under the light, the red threads of blood seem to light up at the same time. The red blood flows in dark. The red light is green and dark. Facing the blue sword, they face up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boom!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The body of the ghost was shocked. The whole person pushed back involuntarily. But the blue sword in front of him was also shocked. It seemed that someone hummed in the cloud, which was obviously not good.</p>
<p>In the past few years, GUI Li has been practicing the magic way and Tianshu day and night, and &ldquo;eating blood beads&rdquo; is beside him. He has a violent temper. At this moment, he has nothing to say. He flies straight ahead and eats the soul to break through the sky.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, only when the soul devoured, I saw that the front clouds were suddenly separated, and the enemy was also extremely strong and stable. Attack at once. With a shrill, driving the magic weapon, he immediately fought with the blue sword.</p>
<p>At the moment, the soul devouring and the blue light have been fighting together, but the clouds are surging. It&rsquo;s hard for the naked eye to see the shape of the magic weapon. It&rsquo;s all controlled by its own and soul devouring induction.</p>
<p>This sudden fight is extremely dangerous for both sides. Both sides are very high figures in Taoism. It&rsquo;s not good. If you don&rsquo;t die under the other side&rsquo;s hands, you only need to be distracted by injuries and be attacked by the fierce miasma around you. It&rsquo;s also a situation of death or not.</p>
<p>The man in front obviously didn&rsquo;t expect to meet such a figure. Although people can&rsquo;t see her face clearly in the clouds, they are unwilling to give up a little when looking at the sword power.</p>
<p>Only in this moment of lightning, soul devouring and that blue sword in the miasma of violent collision, rumbling. With these two magic weapons as the center, the miasma rolled and became a huge vortex.</p>
<p>Even after a long distance, the spirit devouring is the product of the blood refining of the spirit. They still feel like flesh and blood connected with each other. The spirit only feels that the cold feeling on the spirit devouring gradually boils up, as if the magic weapon itself is also spiritually excited. This feeling is really weird. It has not appeared since the completion of his Taoism.</p>
<p>Just. Long ago, when he was still ignorant of youth, this feeling, he once felt</p>
<p>He was suddenly shocked!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s as if there&rsquo;s something hidden. He was tossed in the middle of his heart.</p>
<p>The soul devouring and the blue sword finally collided violently and flew back. At this moment, the surrounding cyclones are getting bigger and bigger. The fighting method between the ghost and the man has reached the most intense moment. They are separated in the miasma and only rely on each other&rsquo;s spiritual awareness. On the one hand, we should guard against the attack of the other side, on the other hand, we should resist the fierce miasma around us. In such dangerous places, it is obvious that the sooner the battle ends, the better!</p>
<p>The surrounding cyclones are violent and turbulent, and at the same time, there are countless small miasma whirlpools, but the fierce eyes are closely staring at the front. After the thick miasma, there is a blue light, and he even feels the murderous eyes of the man.</p>
<p>Suddenly, there was a clear roar, the blue sword burst through the sky, and it suddenly burst through the clouds, forming a huge column of light. When he split his head, he didn&rsquo;t make any Dodge, just flew straight up, burst into the blue light, and went straight to the person.</p>
<p>In the cloud, the man gave a angry shout, and the blue light was very bright. In a moment, all the brilliance was put back to the cloud. After a moment, it solidified into a brilliant sky blue fairy sword. It rushed unstoppably. Almost at the same time, the soul devouring blue light rose up, and in a moment, it pushed back the miasma around and met it.</p>
<p>Life and death, right now!</p>
<p>The man holds the hilt of the sword, gripping the ghost tightly and hedging.</p>
<p>Two sharp awns, instantly spread the miasma around!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like holding your breath, waiting for the moment when you decide to die</p>
<p>The white hand, holding the hilt of the sword; the skirt of the wind, hunting and dancing; she is like the fairy of nine days, the peerless face, at this moment when the clouds are falling apart, appears at the other end.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi!</p>
<p>Many years later, the moment of meeting again</p>
<p>What kind of eyes are they staring at each other,</p>
<p>Even if only for a moment.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, the whole world seems to be suddenly at rest. The gray miasma is pushed back by the supreme magic weapon, slowly showing the figure of the man.</p>
<p>The man who is deeply engraved in the heart is right in front.</p>
<p>She was motionless, with only a slight tremor in her heart.</p>
<p>Two magic weapons, such as electricity and light, are like the enemies of the third generation and the seventh generation. Life is approaching, hate and love. In this moment, I will separate you from death. I live?</p>
<p>That moment is right in front of us!</p>
<p>At that moment, it&rsquo;s just between breaths!</p>
<p>What is faster than this light? What is it that lingers in my heart?</p>
<p>Is it the intention</p>
<p>The shining ghost suddenly slightly deviated and let go. Suddenly, the ghost suddenly opened his chest, and the little ash on his shoulder screamed.</p>
<p>Blue light is like a star. It&rsquo;s coming!</p>
<p>But I didn&rsquo;t feel pain. Blue light from his side of the gap can not be crossed, as if in the dark, there is a general sense, &ldquo;Tianya divine sword&rdquo; also slightly to the other side.</p>
<p>This moment is really very dangerous. If GUI Li and Lu Xueqi slow down or hesitate for a moment, they can immediately kill each other under the magic weapon.</p>
<p>Just, they all gave up somehow.</p>
<p>He still looked at the moment when he was wrong.</p>
<p>In the eyes of that beautiful woman, what was reflected was his shadow</p>
<p>After a while, because they are ready to fight for life and death, they fly out in different directions, far apart!</p>
<p>In the air, on the lapel, is there a faint fragrance of her?</p>
<p>When the sky suddenly brightened, the spirit came back and saw a boundless and dense forest under his feet, and he was falling down. However, the sky is low and the dark clouds flow. I don&rsquo;t know when, they have broken through the thick and incredible miasma and finally reached the dangerous inner water.</p>
<p>He steadied himself in the middle of the air, fell down slowly, and suddenly turned his head. He saw the huge and unmatched miasma wall, still as unchanged since ancient times, standing there, let alone where the woman would be now? (to be continued. )</p>
