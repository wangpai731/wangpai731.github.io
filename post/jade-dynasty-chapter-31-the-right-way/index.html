      <p>Rhubarb lies on the ground, squinting his eyes, wagging his tail from time to time, while monkey Xiaohui lies on his bed, with bright eyes looking at Zhang Xiaofan, who looks haggard. Zhang Xiaofan glared at it and said, &ldquo;what are you looking at?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaohui naturally won&rsquo;t say anything to Zhang Xiaofan, but &ldquo;squeak&rdquo; twice. Look at its monkey face. The owner is hurt. Not only is he not worried about it, but he looks more like gloating.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was annoyed and impatiently said, &ldquo;go, go, go, go to one side!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this time, there was a sound of footsteps. Before he came in, Zhang Xiaofan heard it and said with a smile, &ldquo;six elder martial brother, how can you deliver rice so early today?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His voice suddenly stopped, and Tian&rsquo;s stout body came in slowly from the door. Zhang Xiaofan was surprised. These days, Su Ru only let him rest in peace. Other senior brothers, including Tian linger, only came to see him once. In the rest of the time, only Du Bishu sent him three meals. I didn&rsquo;t expect that Tian would appear suddenly.</p>
<p>He was stunned in bed for a while, and suddenly woke up. He quickly got up. When he got out of bed, he was about to make a big gift. Tian was not easy to have a lot of thoughts. His face was cloudy and clear. He waved and said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan responded, stood up and stood aside, watching Tian not easy to come to sit at the table, not a breath of atmosphere.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard for Tian to take a look at the apprentice. From the reaction just now, the little apprentice can&rsquo;t see that he is like a genius with rich connotation, but he seems to be a little worse than ordinary people, but it&rsquo;s just that</p>
<p>Tian not easy shook his head, sighed, said: &ldquo;old seven, you come to sit down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan is surprised again. It&rsquo;s never easy for Tian to be true to him. Today, he&rsquo;s kind to him, but he doesn&rsquo;t believe his ears.</p>
<p>Tian is not easy to wait for a while, but see Zhang Xiaofan looking at himself in disbelief, as if he hasn&rsquo;t responded. In the heart is a burst of angry again, tiny angry way: &ldquo;want to let me invite you to sit down?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His scolding was full of momentum. Zhang Xiaofan found the feeling of the former master&rsquo;s majesty. Unexpectedly, he immediately responded and sat down.</p>
<p>It was not easy for Tian to see him. Instead, he smothered, looked at him a little more and smiled bitterly.</p>
<p>Shaking his head, he said, &ldquo;how are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan said respectfully: &ldquo;after returning from Tongtian peak, master Meng&rsquo;s father, mother and elder martial brothers have taken care of me. It&rsquo;s almost all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not easy for Tian to look at him. He said lightly, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s been more than a month since Qimai met Wu. It seems you&rsquo;re better. I have a few words. Now I want to ask you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s heart sank. I felt that something I had been afraid of was finally coming, but I could only say, &ldquo;yes, Shifu, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you get that black stick?&rdquo; Tian said slowly</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s heart leaped. He couldn&rsquo;t help but look at Tian, who was staring at him. Although his face was still plain, his eyes were bright and bright, but he was not angry.</p>
<p>At that moment, he turned thousands of thoughts in his mind, but he could not make a sound for a while. Tian was not easy to sink his face slowly. His face was so ugly that he sank again and said, &ldquo;you say it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan is urged by him, and the sweat on his forehead appears in a moment. Although he didn&rsquo;t have much experience, the accidental fusion of the blood bead and the strange black stick in the valley many years ago was too strange after all, and it was sinister and sinister, and it had the ability of sucking blood essence. When talking with elder martial brother Zhu in ordinary days, he knew that he would never be allowed by the right way. If it is not easy to know the truth, I am afraid that the consequences are even more unimaginable.</p>
<p>In addition, in his heart, there is still one thing that has always been a deep taboo, especially since he knew that monk Puzhi was the four great monks of Tianyin temple, then he thought of the set of pithy formula he taught himself</p>
<p>At that moment, he had made up his mind that he could not say anything about him.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not easy for Tian to stare at him.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan stood up and knelt down in the threatening eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian is not easy to frown, hum a, cold way: &ldquo;say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan bowed his head and slowly said, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect to get that black stick when I went to the back mountain valley with my senior sister a few years ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian is not easy to be slightly shocked. Then he thinks that it happened two years ago. Tian ling&rsquo;er went to the valley and was unconscious for no reason. Su Ru went to investigate but found nothing different. Later, she went to see it. It is true. It has always been a small mystery, but I have forgotten it for a long time. Now it seems that it is mostly because of this black stick.</p>
<p>But a black stick can make Tian ling&rsquo;er faint without being urged. What a vicious thing is it? How can Zhang Xiaofan get rid of it? It&rsquo;s not easy for Tian to think of it here. He has more and more doubts in his mind. He says in a deep voice, &ldquo;how did you get it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan did not dare to look up, for fear that he could not see the expression on his face easily. He was not a clever man, but was very anxious at the moment. He could not think of any good explanation excuse in a hurry.</p>
<p>It was not easy for Tian to see his hesitation. How sophisticated and sophisticated he was, he immediately shouted, &ldquo;say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was scared by him. He was sweating, and his heart was pounding. He dared not hide any more. He finally explained the situation of that day. But in this case, when he said something to his mouth, he still took back the story about the blood eating bead. He only said that he saw the black stick in the valley that day, and he was curious to pick it up. As a result, the black stick sucked out his blood essence, and felt sick and nauseous Then he fainted. Before the coma, he faintly saw that the black stick absorbed his blood essence and integrated it into the stick.</p>
<p>After he finished speaking, he dared not lift his head, and did not dare to look at Tian any more. Tian was frowning and fell into a bitter thought: it was not like a lie to see this little apprentice. He could not invent that magic power, but this strange magic power was the first time that even he heard about it in his life. If it was similar to this black stick, he was afraid that it would only be the big murderer of the demon cult a thousand years ago Pearl.</p>
<p>But obviously, this black stick is different from that bloody bead.</p>
<p>It was not easy for Tian to stand up, walk back and forth in the room with his hands on his back, ponder for a while, look back at Zhang Xiaofan, and say, &ldquo;get up first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan answered in a low voice and stood up, but still with his head down, standing aside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But even so, the magic weapon is connected with your blood. It&rsquo;s a blood refining thing &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was surprised and said, &ldquo;master, what is the object of blood refining?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian is not easy Zheng for a while, then impatient way: &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t know even, I ask you to listen to good is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan immediately bowed his head. In a low voice, &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian was not easy to look at him and said, &ldquo;even if the black stick is a rare treasure, you should at least cultivate it to the fourth level of Taiji, Xuanqing, jade and Qing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s face changed.</p>
<p>Tian is not easy to say slowly: &ldquo;I asked you on Tongtian peak that day, today I ask you again.</p>
<p>Who on earth is the secret to you? &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was shocked. He knew that he was in great trouble for the unknown black stick at this time. If he practiced the Dharma formula without permission, he would not be able to imagine waiting for his punishment.</p>
<p>But at the moment, Tian ling&rsquo;er seems to be floating in front of him: when he was young, he took the figure of cutting bamboo on the mountain with himself, the gentle face beside the lonely lamp in the rainy night, and the smile and scolding running at the head of Dazhu peak in the past days. Even the faint fragrance of her body floating in memory is so clear at the moment.</p>
<p>Little by little, floating in my heart!</p>
<p>He knelt down again. He kowtowed heavily, but didn&rsquo;t say a word.</p>
<p>He fell on the ground, motionless, after the injury more and more emaciated body has a strong, but it seems to take a sad.</p>
<p>Tian was not easy to look at him deeply. After a while, he suddenly took a long breath and said, &ldquo;get up and follow me to Tongtian peak. As for whether you have any life to come back. It depends on your creation. &quot;</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Deep in the clouds, surrounded by fairies, everything is peaceful and peaceful like the fairyland in people&rsquo;s dreams.</p>
<p>Qingyun Mountain, Tongtian peak. Yuqing hall.</p>
<p>The seven veins of Qingyun gate are all here, looking at the boy kneeling under the hall.</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan looked at Zhang Xiaofan, who was kneeling there. In his mind, he could not help but reappear the figures of the two rescued children five years ago, the white clouds and the grey dogs, and the world went on and on, as if in a twinkling of an eye. They have grown up.</p>
<p>He sighed in his deep heart, looked away from Zhang Xiaofan, and said to the other leaders, &ldquo;gentlemen, what do you think of what Zhang Xiaofan said just now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they were silent for a while, the voice of Taoist Cangsong suddenly remembered and said, &ldquo;this son&rsquo;s words will never be believed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan, kneeling on the ground, shivered, but did not look up.</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan frowned and said, &ldquo;why is younger martial brother Cangsong so sure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taoist Cangsong glanced at Zhang Xiaofan and said: &ldquo;the method of blood refining is evil and vicious. If there is no demon demon demon to instruct him, how can he have such insight and magic power to refine and make such a magic weapon? Therefore, this man must be a demon spy and cannot spare his life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cangsong has always been in charge of the punishment of Qingyun gate. He is in a high position and has a firm voice. Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s face is almost out of breath when he hears it.</p>
<p>All the people didn&rsquo;t make a sound, but Tian was calm and said slowly, &ldquo;if he really went into my Qingyun gate with all his heart as you said, how could he deliberately cast his magic weapon in front of the public?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taoist Cangsong snorted and said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s hard to guess the behavior of the demon sect demon. It&rsquo;s not surprising that they have evil intentions and do some strange things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian was not angry and said, &ldquo;aren&rsquo;t you far fetched and unreasonable?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taoist Cangsong said coldly: &ldquo;do I try to be reasonable? Elder martial brother Tian, this blood refining method is owned by people in my right way? &quot;</p>
<p>Tian is not easy to speak and his face is red. At this moment, anyone can see that Tian is not easy to stand on his disciple&rsquo;s side. At this awkward moment, a cold voice suddenly came out. It is clear that he is the first master of Shuiyue in xiaozhufeng</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elder martial brother Cangsong, you say that the method of blood refining is evil. How evil and evil is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taoist Cangsong opened his mouth to speak, and suddenly he smothered again, only to say: &ldquo;demon sect, do you need to talk more?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Water moon cold ice tunnel: &ldquo;so, elder martial brother Cangsong also knows nothing about the blood refining method, how can he think that this method is evil and evil, so he will kill this young man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taoist Cangsong looked at master Shuiyue and said, &ldquo;Oh, junior sister Shuiyue, what do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue said lightly: &ldquo;you elder martial brothers, we don&rsquo;t know much about the blood refining method. Although we have heard about it, we often speculate about it. If the so-called blood refining method happens to happen, aren&rsquo;t we wrong to kill good people? Second, he is only 16 years old, and his background is clear. He is forced to say that he is a member of the demon sect. I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s unreasonable. &quot;</p>
<p>Taoist Cangsong narrowed his eyes, but there was a sharp light in his eyes. He said: &ldquo;why is Shuiyue so unusual today. It&rsquo;s really puzzling to try to justify the young man? &quot;</p>
<p>A flash of anger flashed over Shuiyue&rsquo;s beautiful face, which said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m talking about things on the basis of things. I&rsquo;m not like some people. I can&rsquo;t see that talents come from the same family. Afraid of threatening their own status, they will seize some small things and kill them, without humanity! &quot;</p>
<p>If the words are sharp, there are six men in the audience, but none of them can compare with master Shuiyue. Cang Songdao is so popular that his face turns white and he stands up.</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan hurriedly interposed in and said, &ldquo;OK, I&rsquo;m going to have a fight again. Sit down. Sit down. &quot;</p>
<p>Taoist Cangsong did not dare to ignore the words of the headmaster, so he had to sit back to his position hatefully. Looking back at Shuiyue, he looked as if nothing had happened, and sat upright on his chair.</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan shook his head and turned to others, saying, &ldquo;what do you mean, gentlemen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other leaders were silent for a while, and Zeng Shuchang, the first leader of fenghuifeng, said: &ldquo;headmaster, I think sister Shuiyue is right. The young man has a clean history. After the introduction, I never went down the mountain again. I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s a coincidence that I got this treasure. It&rsquo;s the blessing of Qingyun. &quot;</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan nodded slightly and looked at the first Taoist in the sky. Tianyun looked at Cangsong and said, &ldquo;I agree with elder martial brother Cangsong on this matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taoist Cangsong got an ally and nodded to Taoist Tianyun.</p>
<p>At last, there was only the first Shang Zhengliang of Chaoyang peak. He looked at Tian Changyi and others, and then at Taoist Cangsong and Taoist Tianyun. At last, he took a close look at Taoist daoxuan. Micro one ponders, namely way: &ldquo;I thought Shuiyue younger martial sister said reasonably.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian was not easy to lose his face, but Taoist Cangsong hummed. Immortal daoxuan nodded: &ldquo;everyone said, I&rsquo;m not polite.&rdquo; Speaking of this, he first said to Zhang Xiaofan, who was still kneeling on the ground, &ldquo;Xiaofan, get up first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s body shook. He looked up at the teachers and stood up slowly.</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan looked at him twice more, as if he wanted to see him clearly, and then said to the other leaders, &ldquo;you guys, actually I don&rsquo;t think Zhang Xiaofan is like the people in the demon sect. Although the black stick is vicious, it&rsquo;s not as murderous as the evil cult things we&rsquo;ve seen in the past</p>
<p>Taoist Cangsong is not right. He can&rsquo;t help shouting: &ldquo;headmaster, elder martial brother, demon demon is dangerous and vicious. He would rather kill the wrong one than let it go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan&rsquo;s face changed. He looked at him and said, &ldquo;brother Cangsong, do you know what you are talking about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pines knew that they were speechless and kept their heads down.</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan&rsquo;s face was serious, but his voice turned to low, and he said slowly: &ldquo;brother Cangsong, you have been in charge of the punishment in our sect for more than 200 years, fair and strict. I admire you very much. But I think you have become more and more violent and murderous in the past ten years. You are very worried about your brother. Do you know? &quot;</p>
<p>Taoist Cangsong whispered, &ldquo;yes, elder martial brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan said with awe: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the people in the devil&rsquo;s way who are willing to kill the wrong people. Our Qingyun sect is always fair and upright. If something happens, we&rsquo;d rather let it go and not kill the wrong people. Otherwise, what&rsquo;s the difference between us and the people in the devil&rsquo;s way? Younger martial brother Cangsong, although you are deep in Taoism, you still need to practice morality. It&rsquo;s only when you understand Taoism. &quot;</p>
<p>Taoist Cangsong raised his palm and said, &ldquo;thank you for your instruction, elder martial brother. Cangsong has been taught.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; said immortal daoxuan, with a loose face Then he turned to the crowd and they all said, &ldquo;master, elder martial brother is the master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan nodded and said to Zhang Xiaofan, &ldquo;do you hear that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s heart was moved, and even hurried to say, &ldquo;yes, thank you. Thank you, martial uncles.&rdquo; then he turned to Tian not easy, and his voice choked with sobs, saying, &ldquo;thank you, master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian is not easy to put his hand, but did not speak.</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan picked up the short black stick on the tea table at hand and threw it to Zhang Xiaofan. He smiled and said, &ldquo;this thing must be used by you. Take it back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan reached out to catch it, and immediately felt the familiar and cold breath rise up all of a sudden, and walked all over his body, as if he had unspeakable joy. He deeply saluted immortal daoxuan and said, &ldquo;thank you very much, master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan smiled and clapped his hands three times. Immediately after the hall, daotong came over. Immortal daoxuan asked him a few words. Daotong nodded his head and walked out. Soon, three people came in. Zhang Xiaofan looks at the past, but all of them are acquaintances: Qi Hao and Zeng Shushu are in front. Zeng Shushu stealthily makes a face to Zhang Xiaofan while his father, Zeng Shuchang, doesn&rsquo;t pay attention. As for walking at the end, it&rsquo;s the cool and beautiful woman, Lu Xueqi from xiaozhufeng.</p>
<p>These three people, together with Zhang Xiaofan, are exactly the top four disciples of the seven channels of Qingyun sect. (to be continued. )</p>
