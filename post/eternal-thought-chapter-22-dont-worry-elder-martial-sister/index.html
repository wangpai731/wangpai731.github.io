<p>I&rsquo;d like to present today&rsquo;s update. By the way, I&rsquo;d like to draw a vote for the &ldquo;starting point&rdquo; 515 fan Festival. Everyone has 8 tickets. I&rsquo;d like to give you some money to vote for!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at the second stone tablet, little turtle Reproduction</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the first one again. Who is this little turtle? It&rsquo;s the first in two consecutive steles!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elder martial sister Zhou did not guarantee the first eight steles, but became the first in the seven steles!&rdquo;</p>
<p>All around the disciples of the outer gate were in a sudden uproar, and countless exclamations were immediately heard. Especially in the crowd, there was a girl whose voice was penetrating and was cheering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little Turtle, come on This young girl is Hou Xiaomei. She was guided by Bai Xiaochun and began to worship the little turtle. At the moment, she suddenly saw that the little turtle had become the first of the second stele. The feeling of adoration immediately increased, and she had risen to a position beyond Zhou Xinqi in her heart.</p>
<p>After all, the little tortoise was so famous that he told everyone that he was qualified to challenge Zhou Xinqi.</p>
<p>Some people have even begun to wonder whether in the near future, this little turtle will surpass Zhou Xinqi completely on the ten stone tablets.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun in the crowd, before the depression is still, but that kind of feeling of self satisfaction, the same rise, but some regret that others do not know their identity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, one day, I will be in a more conspicuous place and let everyone know that I am the turtle Lord!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun vowed from the bottom of his heart.</p>
<p>After making the oath, he was still unwilling, so he also participated in the exclamations of the people. From time to time, he could hear his shrill voice, leading the people around him to be in uproar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God, who is he? I&rsquo;ve begun to worship him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten thousand people&rsquo;s idols, the turtle Lord is invincible!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the shrill roar of Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s hard work, gradually, the discussion among the disciples of other schools became more and more intense. Seeing the waves rising again, a cold hum came out, and then a figure jumped out of the crowd and stood on a wooden house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let me know who this damned little tortoise is, otherwise, I will make you regret to steal the limelight of younger martial sister Zhou!&rdquo; The speaker was a young man with a cold face and a cold voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you little tortoise, you should be hiding in the crowd now, I will find you!&rdquo; Another voice came from another young man. He flew to the wooden house and looked at the crowd coldly, especially Bai Xiaochun. The voice was very sharp before. When the young man looked at Bai Xiaochun, he did not think that Bai Xiaochun was a little turtle, but he was still not good at it.</p>
<p>Soon, there were more than seven or eight such figures, and each of them exuded the power of cultivation. Especially, the strongest one inside was actually the appearance of seven layers of condensate.</p>
<p>These people are just the best among Zhou Xinqi&rsquo;s admirers. Their appearance makes people around him stop talking and slowly quiet down. However, most of them are uncomfortable in their hearts. When they look at these people, they are more and more disgusted.</p>
<p>Although people support Zhou Xinqi, she is only Zhou Xinqi alone. Moreover, everyone knows it well. In fact, we admire Zhou Xinqi for her real ability.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun was so staring at by the other party. Although he was guilty, there were so many people around him. He decided that the other party did not dare to offend the public anger. So he also looked up at the other party. There was a look like you dare to hit me, and I will fight with you.</p>
<p>Just when the atmosphere here was getting stalemate, a rainbow came quickly from the distance. There was a figure of Miaoman on the blue silk in the rainbow. It was Zhou Xinqi.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s sister Zhou.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sister Zhou is here.&rdquo; The standoff here was immediately broken, and the disciples of the outer gate immediately began to smile when they saw Zhou Xinqi.</p>
<p>And the seven or eight young people they adored all had their own accomplishments, and they all showed their most natural and unrestrained aspects, and they clasped their fists toward Zhou Xinqi.</p>
<p>Zhou Xinqi came here because of hearing about the ranking of the second stone tablet and other things. As soon as the moment approached, she saw the stalemate just now. When she looked at the seven or eight admirers, her eyes showed displeasure and disgust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t get ahead of others in Zhou Xinqi&rsquo;s business. Besides, I have a Tianjiao disciple in Xiangyun mountain. It&rsquo;s a blessing for the clan. If you have another time, you can&rsquo;t blame younger martial sister.&rdquo; Zhou Xinqi cold mouth, voice like a sword, let the seven or eight admirers face a change, angry, but dare not say anything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first and second stone tablets of vegetation, the younger martial brother who surpassed me, you may be in the crowd, since you don&rsquo;t want to show up, you can do as you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhou Xinqi looked up at the little tortoise on the second stone tablet and suppressed her reluctance. Her eyes swept over the crowd. When she spoke faintly, she felt proud in her words.</p>
<p>When the disciples around heard this, they cheered for Zhou Xinqi more and more. Most of them felt that this was Zhou Xinqi, the Tianjiao of Xiangyun mountain that they supported.</p>
<p>In the crowd, Bai Xiaochun secretly told the other party that he was indeed Tianjiao. He said this very beautiful thing. He turned his eyes and naturally recognized the arrogance of the other party. He felt that it was not that he did not want to show up, but that those admirers around the other side were all murderous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have one more thing to do here today. I hope you can help me.&rdquo; Zhou Xinqi looks calm, looking at the crowd, light mouth.</p>
<p>As soon as she uttered her words, all the people around her immediately became interested and listened attentively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;During these days, there was no peace on Xiangyun mountain. Li Qinghou lost a large number of Lingwei chickens. He didn&rsquo;t go home. Maybe he didn&rsquo;t care about it, but as a disciple, I must be responsible. I hope all of you will work hard together to help me catch the chicken thief. If anyone can catch the thief, I will give you a precious jade pendant! &quot; Zhou Xinqi said, taking out a blue jade pendant from her arms. The jade pendant is soft and light, and looks very good.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has a certain degree of protection. I got it by accident in my early years.&rdquo; Zhou Xinqi&rsquo;s voice echoed, and the disciples of other schools in this area immediately looked at the jade pendant. Soon, almost all of them showed an expression of interest and began to promise one after another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elder martial sister Zhou, don&rsquo;t worry. There will be no place for the chicken thief to hide!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The chicken in the palm seat dares to steal. This chicken thief is bold. We must pay more attention to this matter!&rdquo; As soon as the voices came out, all the people&rsquo;s congresses guaranteed that, especially for Zhou Xinqi&rsquo;s admirers, their eyes were like fire and their voices echoed.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun in the crowd some silly eyes, looking around these people with beating chicken blood, he felt chilly behind.</p>
<p>But he was not reconciled to it. The hunger feeling of practicing immortal longevity made Bai Xiaochun feel uncomfortable even when he thought about it. At the moment, his forehead was sweating and his brain was turning quickly. Soon, his eyes lit up and he slapped his chest. His voice reverberated through the crowd with penetrating power.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elder martial sister Zhou, I, Bai Xiaochun, will finish my elder martial sister&rsquo;s task and catch the chicken thief no matter whether I go to the knife mountain or down to the oil pan!&rdquo; His voice was so sharp and obvious that he even broke out of the crowd and stood in the front.</p>
<p>As soon as he rushed out, he was immediately attracted by people&rsquo;s eyes, especially when he patted his chest hard and heard the sound of bang. Even some of Zhou Xinqi&rsquo;s admirers were not as good as themselves, and Zhou Xinqi couldn&rsquo;t help looking at him.</p>
<p>Seeing that the disciples of the same sect support themselves like this, Zhou Xinqi smiles on her face and nods slightly. Just as she is about to leave, she hears the sharp voice that precedes others&rsquo; words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elder martial sister Zhou, I have a proposal. Why don&rsquo;t we form a team to catch the thieves, so that we can work together and protect the spirit tail chicken in my palm seat!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s face is upright, and she has the momentum to spare no cost for elder martial sister Zhou&rsquo;s task.</p>
<p>Zhou Xinqi was stunned. After hearing about it, many people thought it was a good idea and agreed with it one after another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but our practice is the main thing. Let&rsquo;s do it voluntarily.&rdquo; Zhou Xinqi nodded and looked at Bai Xiaochun again. She thought that although the younger martial brother was fresh, she was white and clean. She looked very clever. Especially when she supported herself, she seemed quite devout. She had a good impression and gave a smile to Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since this proposal was put forward by this enthusiastic younger martial brother, you should set up this team to catch thieves. I have ten silk ribbons as Keepsake marks of the team.&rdquo; She said, from the storage bag took out ten blue ribbon, gently waved, the ten ribbon fly to Bai Xiaochun, fell in his hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, elder martial sister. I have everything.&rdquo; Holding the silk ribbon, Bai Xiaochun held her head high and held her chest high. A pair of Lingwei chicken for the palm seat was very kind and could look like a total loss of brains.</p>
<p>Zhou Xinqi showed a wisp of appreciation in her eyes. She thought that there were not many young teachers with such a sense of responsibility in Zong&rsquo;s family. After remembering Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s clever appearance, she turned to leave.</p>
<p>Zhou Xinqi looks at Bai Xiaochun in a different way. Those admirers of Zhou Xinqi are unwilling to accept it. They secretly regret the idea of flattering Zhou Xinqi. How can they not think of it.</p>
<p>After Zhou Xinqi left, those disciples who raised Lingqi chicken rushed out to thank everyone, especially Bai Xiaochun. Bai Xiaochun stood up and denounced the chicken thieves. In the end, those chicken raising disciples were moved one by one. Under Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s guidance, the thief team was finally composed of disciples whose accomplishments were not as high as his.</p>
<p>A moment later, Bai Xiaochun walked on the way back, wiped the cold sweat on her forehead and sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was too dangerous just now. I almost gave up my food in the future. Fortunately, Bai Xiaochun is smart and smart. Hum.&rdquo; When Bai Xiaochun thought of this place, he was elated again. He hummed a little song and went back to the yard where he lived. He saw the Lingdong bamboo in the holy field. The bamboo&rsquo;s rise was so terrible that it had grown to nearly a foot high. It was quite amazing.</p>
<p>On that night, with dark clouds all around, Bai Xiaochun opened her eyes from meditation and licked her lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The moon is dark and the sky is high. I seem to be hungry again&hellip;&rdquo;.</p>
<hr>
<p>12 o&rsquo;clock tonight, appointment!</p>
<p>[it&rsquo;s about to be 515 soon. I hope it can continue to impact the 515 red envelope list. On May 15, the red envelope rain will give back to readers and publicity works. A piece is also love, must be better! ]</p>
