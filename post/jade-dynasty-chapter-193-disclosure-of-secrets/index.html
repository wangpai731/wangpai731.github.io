      <p>South Xinjiang, 100000 mountains.</p>
<p>After crossing the black mountains and entering the 100000 mountains, GUI li felt that he had entered a truly wild and primitive world. In fact, in the demon religion, wilderness originally refers to a vast and uninhabited area in the extreme northwest of the vast land of Shenzhou. Most of the places there are Gobi desert, where there is no grass. Even if there is life, it is also a very tenacious wild heritage, so named. And the temple in the legend of the demon cult is somewhere there, but the ghost has never been there.</p>
<p>But the world in front of us is obviously different from the wild land in the legend. In 100000 mountains, not only is there no grass, it is just a mixture of grass and grass. Along the way, large areas of virgin forest, almost no place to settle down, any piece of land, as if full of plants competing for living space. And behind the endless trees and thorns, it seems that there are endless poisonous animals. In the dark side, it seems that there will always be malicious and ferocious eyes spying on you, waiting for an opportunity to sneak attack, to put you to death, into a delicious meal.</p>
<p>For characters like GUI Li and Jin Ping&rsquo;er, these ordinary poisons are not a special threat, but they are endless, which is really painful. Although they can fly in the sky, they may not know when the miasma and poisonous fog will rise over the primeval forest. Secondly, although they have profound Taoism, they still have to rest, but they are harassed by the outside world, but they hardly stop.</p>
<p>A few days down, it seems that even monkey Xiao Hui also began to be restless.</p>
<p>In addition, in addition to the harassment of these poisonous fog beasts, the strange weather in the 100000 mountains is also a rather uncomfortable thing. It is quite different from the middle earth region. There is no process of cloud gathering and changing of the sky. The rain here is almost as soon as it rains. At the beginning, it is still a sunny sky. In the twinkling of an eye, it is pouring down in torrential rain. When it comes to stopping, it is said to stop at once, with lightning and thunder in the first moment, and there is no cloud in the next moment. It was astonishing and speechless.</p>
<p>And the time of rain seems to have no exact number, short time and a half meeting, long days more than, it is impossible to know.</p>
<p>Now. The two of them were walking in a dark forest under the continuous rain.</p>
<p>The reason why the two of them did not use magic to fight against the sky was that when they planned to do so, they found this strange place. Even when it rained, there was still strange black gas rising above the black forest, on the contrary. On the contrary, the air in the land under the forest is relatively normal.</p>
<p>GUI Li and Jin Ping&rsquo;er are both characters who have been steeped in the demon cult for a long time. Their eyesight is also very important. Naturally, they know the importance of them. After discussion, they are willing to be more prudent and walk through the black forest.</p>
<p>Like many primitive forests in the 100000 mountains, this forest has dense branches and leaves. The rain in the sky can not fall directly to the ground, but from the dense branches and leaves, the top of the trees flows down the branches. In addition to the rustling sound of their walking and the distant sound of rain and water, the whole forest seems to be sleeping in the rain.</p>
<p>GUI Li and Jin Ping&rsquo;er didn&rsquo;t carry an umbrella, most of them didn&rsquo;t take it with them. However, in such a lush forest, they had umbrellas. I&rsquo;m afraid that it&rsquo;s difficult to walk with an umbrella. Xiaohui did not say a word, shrunk up, lying on the shoulder. The rain from the branches and leaves above made his hair wet. Flat on the body.</p>
<p>There are also drops of water on GUI Li&rsquo;s face, but his face is still indifferent. Walking in front of him, it seems that he can&rsquo;t feel the strange smell around him at all. The Golden Vase followed him. It seems that there is no tired color, but the slightly disordered hair and some indifferent expression seem to reflect her unhappy mood.</p>
<p>This forest, in fact, is the black forest she visited last time. Jinpinger knows clearly in her heart that she should walk out of this forest. After a few more hills, we can reach the destination they are going to. In fact, that&rsquo;s what she said to Gui Li.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sand&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li stretched out his hand to break a fallen branch and saw that the extremely tough old vine like branches were as fragile as tofu in his hands. The Golden Vase son behind him, silently looked at the GUI Li that palm one eye, in the eye seems to have the color of thinking, slightly frown.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, he gave a sharp &ldquo;Yi&rdquo; sound, and then he turned left and took a few steps. At that time, he only saw a bright and bright face before meeting. The place where he lived was a cliff. The rock was about several feet round, without vegetation. At the foot of the rock, there was an empty sea of clouds, and the clouds were rolling. Among them, the five colors were beautiful.</p>
<p>With the sound of footsteps, Jin pinger also stood beside him, and her face changed slightly. This is the place where she was plotted by the mysterious man in black last time. After escaping by chance, she found a killing knife of the monk under the cliff. However, she looked at it fiercely, but said nothing. Obviously, she did not tell all the things she had found Man&rsquo;s plan.</p>
<p>Looking at the sea of clouds from afar, he shook his head a little after a while and said, &ldquo;the clouds below are colorful. I&rsquo;m afraid they are still poisonous miasma.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Golden Vase son nodded and said, &ldquo;I think so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at her and said, &ldquo;how far is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Golden Vase reached out and gently wiped the water on her forehead. She said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not far away. I remember that when I came here last time, I went no further than an hour, and then I came out of this black forest. When you get out of here, you&rsquo;ll cross two more mountains, and you&rsquo;ll arrive at the Zhenmo cave. &quot; Speaking of this, she paused for a moment, and said in a puzzled way: &ldquo;strange, the last time I came here, there are clearly many evil animals in the black forest. How come, in this way, except those poisonous insects, no decent beast has been seen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid the monsters you see will follow the beast God to eat people outside the 100000 mountains,&rdquo; he said</p>
<p>Jin pinger was stunned, and then thought that it might be very big, and then there was an expression of disgust on her face. In any case, even though she was born in a demon sect, she seemed to reject the beast demon, which is a kind of inhuman and inhuman disaster. Or, in the battle of poisonous snake Valley in China, all the troops of the Hehuan sect were destroyed. Although ghost and fierce still don&rsquo;t know why jinpinger can escape alone and join the command of ghost king, Jin pinger will not have any good feelings for these monsters.</p>
<p>GUI Li took a deep breath, lifted his spirits and said, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he turned and walked back into the dark forest. Jinpinger was about to catch up with her, but she suddenly turned around and took a look under the cliff. Her willow eyebrows wrinkled slightly. It seems to be thinking about something. After walking for a while, he doesn&rsquo;t feel that the Golden Vase son keeps up with him. He turns around and shouts, and the golden bottle son wakes up. With a smile, he said, &ldquo;why, did you miss me so soon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a glance at her, she turned away indifferently, and went straight. The Golden Vase followed her with a smile. At the moment when she was about to enter the forest, a white light flashed from her hand.</p>
<p>Flying out, the momentum is very fast, a dull sound of &ldquo;Dui&rdquo; is inserted into the gap in a remote corner of the cliff.</p>
<p>The light flashed slowly in the gap, which was the once killing knife.</p>
<p>In the twinkling of an eye, the figure of the Golden Vase has disappeared.</p>
<p>Desolate wind and bitter rain, as if shrouded over, covered this strange black forest, far away, the vast sky of 100000 mountains. It seems that they are all gray. I don&rsquo;t know if there are any gods or demons, roaring and roaring in the dark, staring at the tiny existence in the world</p>
<p>The wind and rain is more urgent!</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>At the time when GUI Li and Jin Ping&rsquo;er trudged in the bitter wind and rain, chasing the trace of the beast God among the 100000 mountains. The southern Xinjiang beyond the 100000 mountains and mountains is also a school of fervent atmosphere.</p>
<p>More and more orthodox disciples came to southern Xinjiang. At the same time, their arrival almost rapidly reduced the number of the remains of animal spirits that fled in southern Xinjiang. However, there has never been such a large number of Middle Earth people in southern Xinjiang. And most of them are monks.</p>
<p>The native people of the five ethnic groups in southern Xinjiang have always held a kind of attitude of keeping a distance from these foreigners. However, among these righteous disciples, there seems to be a strange atmosphere. Most of them keep a distance when they meet as long as they are not from the same sect. Sometimes, they even hear that there are conflicts among disciples of some sects.</p>
<p>However, it seems that no one has ever announced it in a loud voice.</p>
<p>In a sense, as the oldest monasticist in southern Xinjiang, it has become the best place for many orthodox disciples who are not familiar with the local geographical conditions to visit and ask for advice. Therefore, the valley has changed its former tranquility, with a continuous stream of people, and people can see people coming in and out every day.</p>
<p>On this day, three people, one man and two women, came to the gate of the burning incense valley. They were Zeng Shushu from fenghuifeng and Wenmin and Lu Xueqi from xiaozhufeng under the gate of Qingyun.</p>
<p>Naturally, there are not only three of them who have come to southern Xinjiang. In fact, Qingyun gate is known as the first orthodox school in the world. It has sent numerous young disciples, but the best of them have not been able to come. In addition to a few people who have already taken on important responsibilities in the sect, such as Qi Hao, Xiao Yicai also has many affairs on Tongtian peak due to the fact that there are fewer real people in daoxuan As for Lin Jingyu, he insisted on staying in the ancestral hall this time. It is said that it was for the sake of some elder Qingyun, who had deep gratitude to him, to guard the spirit, and could not come.</p>
<p>Among the others, Zeng Shushu and Lu Xueqi were the leaders. Zeng Shushu was nothing. His father, Zeng Shuchang, gave a few words and then came to southern Xinjiang. Lu Xueqi came here with twists and turns. It is said that master Shuiyue didn&rsquo;t want him to go out, but later he changed his mind. He just asked Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s elder martial sister Wen Min to follow him. However, Wen minlai has one advantage, that is, he has one more speaker along the way. Otherwise, Zeng Shushu was originally a monkey like active character. If he only got along with Lu Xueqi, who was like frost, he was afraid that at the end of the day, nine of Zeng&rsquo;s ten sentences were all self talking, and most of the remaining one was Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s impatient urge him to go away.</p>
<p>On the way to southern Xinjiang, Zeng Shushu got along well with Wen min. they discussed with each other. Zeng Shushu suggested that no matter what, as a member of the right path, he would still go to the incense Valley to visit him. But Lu Xueqi did not seem willing to express her opinions. She said that she had never been here in southern Xinjiang. She probably knew how to go, so she didn&rsquo;t have to bother others.</p>
<p>Zeng Shu and Wen Min know quite well that Lu Xueqi still has a knot in her heart. On that day, when she was in the Yuqing Hall of Tongtian peak, Qingyun gate, she firmly refused to marry Yun Yilan, the master of the burning incense Valley, as her favorite disciple Li Xun. This greatly hurt the face of Yun Yilan and daoxuan, and naturally she was unwilling to associate with people in the burning incense valley.</p>
<p>However, after several discussions between Zeng Shushu and Wen Min, Wen Min still persuades Lu Xueqi to come over and do something, otherwise he will not look good in front of the teacher in the future. Lu Xueqi hesitated and finally agreed.</p>
<p>The three of them came to the mouth of the burning incense valley. Originally, the three men had some fame, especially Lu Xueqi, who was a national beauty since the rise of the younger generation of Qingyun gate. Her fame and appearance are famous all over the world.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi was afraid of having more meaning for the burning incense Valley, because when the three of them just appeared at the mouth of the burning incense Valley, they were recognized almost immediately by the disciples of the burning incense valley.</p>
<p>After the initial shock, there seemed to be a stir. However, some people quickly stepped in to give back. At the same time, several people immediately welcomed them. The first one said with a smile: &ldquo;ah, it&rsquo;s really rare for elder martial sister Lu to drive to the burning incense valley. These two are also senior brothers and sisters of Qingyun gate. Please come in and come in. &quot;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu looks at Wen Min behind his back, secretly spits out his tongue and makes a face. He thinks that Lu Xueqi is really famous and frightening. Even the ordinary disciple of burning incense Valley can recognize it at a glance. Obviously, he and Wen Min belong to the passers-by who follows the beauty.</p>
<p>Neither of them was angry. Zeng Shushu was even more smiling. He laughed and joked with the disciples of the burning incense Valley all the way. He heard them laughing from time to time. Wen Min, who was walking behind, said with a smile to Lu Xueqi: &ldquo;younger martial sister, you can see that younger martial brother Zeng has just met. He is really good at mixing with others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi looks at Zeng Shushu in front of her. Now she has put her hand on the shoulder of the disciple of burning incense valley. She smiles faintly, but she has no words.</p>
<p>Soon, they were led by the disciples of the burning incense valley. When we arrived at the mountain and river Hall of the burning incense Valley, it was amazing that Yun Yilan was sitting on the throne waiting for them, obviously in the eyes of the master of the burning incense valley. The weight of the three masters of Qingyun gate is quite different from that of other sects.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Zeng Shushu and Wen Min are not ignorant of their lofty position. They know the status and status of Yun Yilan. It is quite condescending to receive them in person. At the moment, the three men rushed forward, and Zeng Shushu met the queen of the ceremony. He said: &ldquo;how can you meet me personally? It should be the younger generation to see you. It&rsquo;s really killing the younger generation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yun Yilan gave a slight smile, and his face was very kind. He said with a smile: &ldquo;nephew, where is the word? I have been friends with your uncle daoxuan for more than 100 years, and your father, uncle Zeng, and senior brother Zeng. They have been friends for more than 100 years. Where can I use such courtesy. How are they</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu said respectfully: &ldquo;the headmaster and my father are doing well. The two elders wish me well. When you come to southern Xinjiang, you must come to see Master Yun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cloud Yi Lan ha ha ha laughs, nod a way: &ldquo;green cloud a farewell, twinkling of an eye is many days, I really miss a few old friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that, he looked at Zeng Shu&rsquo;s back with a smile. His eyes turned on Wen Min, and then fell on Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s indifferent face.</p>
<p>As if feeling Yun Yilan&rsquo;s eyes, Lu Xueqi raised her eyes and saw Yun Yilan looking at herself with a smile on her face. Beside him, there was a man with a complicated expression on his face, which seemed to have a wry smile. In her own eyes, it was Li Xun.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi was silent and bowed her head slightly.</p>
<p>Cloud Yi Lan tiny smile, move eyes, smile way: &ldquo;how several people still stand, you and I two faction relations are unusual, is a family, quick sit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu and others charged and sat down at the bottom.</p>
<p>Yun Yilan talks to the three people again. Knowing that Wen Min is a disciple of master Shuiyue of xiaozhufeng, just like Lu Xueqi, she asks more about master Shuiyue, and Wen Min answers them one by one. Later, Yun Yilan talks to Zeng Shushu again. From the beginning to the end, it seemed that he knew that Lu Xueqi didn&rsquo;t want to speak. He didn&rsquo;t ask Lu Xueqi. Lu Xueqi was also very happy and sat beside her without saying a word.</p>
<p>However, the other disciples of incense burning Valley on the mountain and river hall, including Li Xun standing beside Yun Yilan, spent most of the time gazing on Lu Xueqi intentionally or unintentionally. The woman in white, like snow, seems to have a strange magic under her cool temperament, which makes the highlights of the whole hall gather quietly on her.</p>
<p>Over there, Yun Yilan asked Zeng Shushu with a smile: &ldquo;after the war on that day, elder martial brother daoxuan defeated the beast God for all the people in the world, and saved the storm from defeat. His merits are boundless. However, when I left Qingyun, his injury did not seem to be very good. How is senior brother daoxuan&rsquo;s Health recently? He is now a leader of the right way. He is expected by all</p>
<p>Zeng Shu replied with a smile: &ldquo;thank you for your concern. Master, you are all right. As long as you can let all the people in the world escape the disaster, Qingyun sect will suffer a little bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yun Yilan&rsquo;s smile became more and more kind. He took a sip of the cup on the tea table at hand, and then his eyes flickered slightly. As if he had thought of it unintentionally, he said with a smile: &ldquo;by the way, I heard a rumor recently. It happened that my nephew came here recently and asked you about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu said with a smile, &ldquo;master Yun, please tell me that I must know everything and say everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yun Yilan nodded, and the essence flashed in his eyes. He said slowly: &ldquo;I heard that recently, after elder martial brother daoxuan defeated the beast gods and demons, there was still a fight on Qingyun Mountain. In the end, it was reported that the supreme treasure of Qingyun gate and the ancient sword of killing Immortals had been broken and damaged. Is this true?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as this saying was said, the whole mountain and river hall was solemn and quiet, but Zeng Shushu, Wen Min and Lu Xueqi stood up at the same time, their faces changed color and looked at Yun Yilan. Other disciples of the burning incense Valley, including Li Xun, looked at Yun Yilan in amazement.</p>
<p>Only Yun Yilan seems to have nothing to do with himself. It seems that what he asked just now is not a big event that affects the world, but an ordinary trivial matter. He gently picks up the tea cup and drinks a sip of tea.</p>
<p>Then, with a kind and gentle smile, he asked, &ldquo;is that true?&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the mountain and river hall, there was a dead silence. (to be continued. )</p>
