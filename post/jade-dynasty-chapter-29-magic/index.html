<p>And into the night.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan couldn&rsquo;t sleep, and the monkey Xiaohui beside him also opened his eyes, blinked at him. As for other senior brothers, they had already snored a lot, that is rhubarb. Now they are sleeping on the ground.</p>
<p>Moonlight, like water, came in through the window and sprinkled on the ground like frost and snow.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan stealthily gets up, and Xiaohui rushes into his arms. Zhang Xiaofan holds it, touches its head, and walks out.</p>
<p>The corridor is clear and silent.</p>
<p>He smiled bitterly in secret. After arriving at tongtianfeng, he had hardly slept soundly in one night. Thinking of tomorrow&rsquo;s contest with Lu Xueqi, he was still nervous.</p>
<p>At this time, the monkey Xiaohui in his arms suddenly moved uneasily. Zhang Xiaofan looked at it and saw that under the moonlight, Xiaohui&rsquo;s smart eyes were looking at the shadow ahead.</p>
<p>In the dark, as if a shadow flashed by.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s heart moved and followed.</p>
<p>The figure didn&rsquo;t run fast, and his shoulder seemed to keep moving, but he seemed to cry. Zhang Xiaofan saw it from afar and recognized it was Tian ling&rsquo;er, which was even more strange in his heart. At the same time, looking at the way elder martial sister cried, he felt a sense of sadness in his heart.</p>
<p>Tian ling&rsquo;er ran straight to the sea of clouds and came to the challenge arena in the center. Seeing that there was no one around, he could no longer bear it. He squatted on the ground and cried.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan has never seen elder martial sister so sad. He is in a trance in his mind and slowly walks to her side. He murmurs: &ldquo;elder martial sister, you&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian ling&rsquo;er is scared, jumps up and turns around. Seeing it is Zhang Xiaofan, she puts down her heart. Then her heart is sour again. She can&rsquo;t help but pounce on Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s arms and cry loudly on his shoulder.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s body was stiff in an instant, his whole body was petrified, and he could not move any more.</p>
<p>Her sobs echoed in her ears. From her shoulder, she felt the light warmth of her body, as if the scene that she often saw in the dream had really happened today. A faint fragrance seems to come.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan stood like this and looked at the distance. Although there were countless thoughts in his heart to embrace this woman, he did not.</p>
<p>Perhaps, really hugged you, life will be different from now on, right?</p>
<p>At this time, Tian linger left his shoulder. Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s heart is empty and vague, feeling what he has lost.</p>
<p>His shoulders were wet with tears.</p>
<p>Tian ling&rsquo;er rubs his red eyes with his hands and sees Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s shoulder, which is wet with tears. His face is red and he says, &ldquo;sorry, Xiaofan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan shook his head and said, &ldquo;elder martial sister, what&rsquo;s wrong with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian ling&rsquo;er just wanted to talk, but she heard something &ldquo;squeaking&rdquo; under her feet. She looked down, but Xiaohui also followed. She leaned down silently and held the ash in her arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never, Xiao Fan, never.&rdquo; The woman stood in the moonlight of the night, sad and beautiful, and said to Zhang Xiaofan with some sadness, &ldquo;my father and mother have never scolded me like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Looking at the beautiful face in the sadness, Zhang Xiaofan felt a tear like pain in his heart, as if all her sadness was brought to her by himself. He tried to calm himself and said softly, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter, elder martial sister? Why did Shifu scold you? &quot;</p>
<p>Tian ling&rsquo;er hesitates for a moment, looks up at Zhang Xiaofan, who is the closest playmate to her except her parents. Now in her heart, it seems that there is a faint thought: when did younger martial brother Xiaofan start to be so gentle with me?</p>
<p>However, the thought just flashed by, her heart was full of sadness at the moment, and finally she cried to Zhang Xiaofan: &ldquo;not all for brother Qihao!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s face was white and he could not help holding his fist. He held it so tightly that his fingernails were deeply stabbed into his hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know yet?&rdquo; Once Tian ling&rsquo;er opened the conversation, he was no longer defensive to this little younger martial brother, but Zhang Xiaofan shouted in his heart, &ldquo;I know, I know, I already know!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The moon is cold and full of people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Senior brother Qihao and I are in love. I told them that I really like him.&rdquo; Tian ling&rsquo;er calmed down a little, but didn&rsquo;t realize that every word she said, Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s face lost a color of blood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip; but my father scolded me loudly, saying that I didn&rsquo;t understand. Even my mother, who has always hurt me, turned pale and stood on my father&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>How can this happen, Xiao Fan? &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan lowered his head to prevent Tian ling&rsquo;er from seeing his face and whispered, &ldquo;how can Shifu Shiniang know that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian ling&rsquo;er was in a state of agitation, and didn&rsquo;t realize that Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s words had some flaws and differences. When his mouth was flat, he almost cried again: &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect that, but later I knew that it was senior sister xiaozhufeng Wenmin who lived with me who told uncle Shuiyue, and uncle Shuiyue told my mother again. I&rsquo;m so close to elder martial sister Wenmin. I&rsquo;ve told them many times, but they still said, &ldquo;I, I&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her eyes were sore, and tears finally came out.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan said astringently, &ldquo;maybe Shifu and Shiniang are for you. They are your parents. They will never be bad to you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian ling&rsquo;er dried his eyes and cried, &ldquo;what do they know! They only know the sect&rsquo;s view, only that elder brother Qi Hao is the proud disciple of martial uncle Cangsong of dragon head peak, only that if elder brother Qi Hao and I get well, they will not be able to raise their heads in Qingyun gate, and they have not thought about it for me at all. &quot;</p>
<p>With some sadness, some anger and even some determination, she said: &ldquo;compared with my happiness, those faces are nothing. I really doubt whether they value face or my daughter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan raised his head and looked at the elder martial sister who suddenly became strange.</p>
<p>What a sad look that was!</p>
<p>Helpless, like a bird standing alone in the wind and rain, sad with a trace of panic, like a knife into his soul!</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was almost immediately defeated by this kind of eyes. A kind of sadness that never existed came from his heart. If he could bear the pain of this moment for this woman, he was willing to bear all the difficulties, but he didn&rsquo;t know what to say, so he could only make a low cry:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Senior sister!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to be with him,&rdquo; Tian ling&rsquo;er said decidedly. Instead of what she said to Zhang Xiaofan, she said to her inner heart and Tian uneasy couple who are not here. &ldquo;I must be with senior brother Qihao. If we have made a vow, we will be together even if the sea is dry and the rocks are rotten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked up at the night sky and swore to the bright moon.</p>
<p>The cold moonlight sprinkled on her quietly. Her beauty is like a lily blooming in the night with sadness. It makes people dazzled by her beauty and forget the shadow beside her, which is bleak and heartless.</p>
<p>　　※※※</p>
<p>Standing at a high place, the rising sun sprinkled warm on Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s body, warm the body but not warm the heart. He stood on the challenge arena, expressionless, facing Lu Xueqi, who stood in front of him.</p>
<p>The contempt in the eyes of the ice woman was so obvious that, as everyone knows, he was more in the top four by luck than strength.</p>
<p>Behind her, there was a light blue light from Tianya. Zhang Xiaofan looked at the legendary artifact and thought lightly: in a moment, is it he facing it?</p>
<p>Then, in a moment, he forgot the problem. Since he came back last night, his spirit has been fluctuating in a trance.</p>
<p>There are only two big challenge arena above the sea of clouds at the moment. But in terms of the number of Qingyun disciples around, the number of people watching the book contest between Qihao and Zeng in the west is less than 30%. Almost all of them are attracted by Lu Xueqi and Zhang Xiaofan, who are the most popular and lucky. Among the elders, most of them, including the leader, Taoist XuanZhen, are attracted I also sat under the challenge arena.</p>
<p>However, after seeing Lu Xueqi on the challenge arena, the crowd cheered for a while, mostly discussing whether Zhang Xiaofan would lose in a breath or in a moment.</p>
<p>Under the stage, Tian is not easy to frown. Even though Zhang Xiaofan knows what he knows, he is still uncomfortable to hear the scornful comments from people behind him. Su Ru, who was sitting beside him, was looking around for her daughter. In a big quarrel last night, Tian ling&rsquo;er ran away crying. Today, she lost her figure in the morning. As a mother, she knew about her daughter. She was afraid that the stubborn daughter had gone to the challenge arena of Qihao competition.</p>
<p>She shook her head. Although she loved the only daughter very much, this time she was totally on her husband&rsquo;s side. Maybe it was a mother instinct. She always felt that the people in the dragon head peak were not very good.</p>
<p>She turned her head and looked at the stage. At the same time, Zhang Xiaofan on the stage also looked at her face to face. Their eyes met each other in the air. A moment later, Zhang Xiaofan looked around her, as if he didn&rsquo;t find the person to look for, and silently took his eyes back.</p>
<p>Su Ru frowned slightly and said to Tian, &ldquo;Xiao Fan looks a little wrong today, as if he is dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian is not easy to light way: &ldquo;he is nervous just, the child did not see the world, no wonder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru was silent and did not speak again.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan takes back his eyes and falls on Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s face opposite. The beautiful face in the rising sun is bright and shining. Soon, Lu Xueqi feels Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s eyes and looks down again.</p>
<p>But this time, Zhang Xiaofan didn&rsquo;t evade, he didn&rsquo;t even feel the ironic eyes on the other side. The beautiful face was totally meaningless to him at the moment. Only in his deep heart, he read a low and painful sentence: &ldquo;she&rsquo;s not here, she went to see Qihao&rsquo;s competition!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Smart as Lu Xueqi, soon found that this opponent just looked at himself, but in his empty eyes he clearly thought of other things and completely ignored his existence. It was almost the first time in her life, and there seemed to be a hint of surprise in her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bells and tripods are ringing together, echoing on the Tongtian peak. Around the room, there was a quick silence.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi straightens up and takes a deep breath. As long as she wins two more games, she can achieve her dream and her teacher&rsquo;s expectation. The sky Ya is behind her, the blue light gradually brightens up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little Zhufeng disciple Lu Xueqi, please give me some advice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan wakes up from his dream, but his first reaction is not to return the gift, but to look under the stage with great expectations. There, the head is shaking, and people are paying attention, but there is no one he wants to see.</p>
<p>As soon as Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s face changed, Qingyun&rsquo;s disciples were also in a state of uproar. This was the first one who was so rude to Lu Xueqi. Tian could not easily look at Su Ru. At the same time, they all realized that there was something wrong with him today.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan turned his head slowly, his face was as gray as death. He said lightly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Zhang Xiaofan from dazhufeng. Please don&rsquo;t be merciful, elder martial sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi is stunned. Although all he said before the competition were just polite words, Zhang Xiaofan looks very strange. It sounds like ridicule when someone says something merciless. But it doesn&rsquo;t look like him.</p>
<p>But Lu Xueqi, after all, is the proud disciple of master Shuiyue. Her heart is firm, her face is the same, and she doesn&rsquo;t say anything more. With her right hand, the &ldquo;Tianya&rdquo; behind her rises slowly.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan watched the blue light getting deeper and bigger. He took the blue light on his body, but he couldn&rsquo;t find any nervous feeling. Instead, he looked forward to something in his heart.</p>
<p>He took out the black and ugly stick.</p>
<p>There was a burst of laughter under the stage. Compared with the magnificent and noble immortal &ldquo;Tianya&rdquo; on the opposite side, the fire stick was like an ugly insect on the ground.</p>
<p>And at this moment, or a heart if dead insects.</p>
<p>The cold feeling fills the whole body again. I don&rsquo;t know why. Today, this fire stick seems to be particularly excited as if it has spirituality. The cold feeling swims faster than before. Zhang Xiaofan even felt that if he didn&rsquo;t feel blood and flesh connected with the fire stick, if he didn&rsquo;t hold the fire stick, he would have rushed to Lu Xueqi.</p>
<p>No, it should not be towards Lu Xueqi, but towards Tianya. That inexplicable feeling is like two enemies with deep hatred.</p>
<p>At this moment, Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s face suddenly changed. The light of Tianya is too bright. It seems that she is also a little strange.</p>
<p>But Zhang Xiaofan didn&rsquo;t think about it. He looked at the beautiful woman in the blue light and suddenly found that she was like a senior sister, but &ldquo;senior sister&rdquo; looked at him coldly with cold eyes.</p>
<p>On the challenge arena, something unexpected happened. Zhang Xiaofan and Lu Xueqi didn&rsquo;t do anything but stare at each other.</p>
<p>There was an uproar and a lot of discussion.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi suddenly wakes up. There is a sudden change in Tianya, which has always been connected with her spirituality, which makes her feel strange. However, there is nothing different in looking at Tianya with her mind. It is just as if there is a feeling of desire in Tianya.</p>
<p>I felt that there were countless strange eyes on the scene. Lu Xueqi frowned, calmed down, snorted coldly, put all kinds of miscellaneous thoughts out of her mind, and chided lightly. Tianya was in full bloom with blue light, rising from the sky, but still did not go out of its sheath.</p>
<p>Since the martial arts competition of the seven pulse society, Tianya has become the focus of attention. But until now, Lu Xueqi has defeated all the opponents one by one without going out of the sheath. This also makes people guess who can let her draw out the magic sword. At this time, everyone guesses that it must be the final battle to achieve this with the cultivation of Qihao, the dragon head peak.</p>
<p>Blue light, reflected on Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s face, but could not show his expression. The black fire stick issued a light blue light, slowly left his palm, and stopped in front of him.</p>
<p>Although I&rsquo;ve seen this fire stick for a long time, it&rsquo;s the first time that people, including most of the onlookers, have seen Zhang Xiaofan practice. Du Bishu snorted and said, &ldquo;if I hadn&rsquo;t seen it with my own eyes, I really don&rsquo;t believe that two years ago, the stupid junior brother suddenly became a natural genius.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the stage, Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s face was solemn, and his formula was as firm as a mountain. He saw that in the middle of the sky, the bright Tianya suddenly turned around and rushed to Zhang Xiaofan as fast as lightning.</p>
<p>The staff immediately went up. The dark blue light collided with the blue light in the mid air. It seemed that they were not afraid of it.</p>
<p>The next moment, in the daze of all the people, I saw Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s vulnerable appearance. If he was badly hurt, the whole person flew back out. The fire stick was even more pale, turning around in the air and flying back to the direction of the master.</p>
<p>For a while, the people of dazhufeng stood up, and those who were impatient, such as Du Bishu, cried out.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s back bumped against the post of the challenge arena and fell down. His throat was sweet and his blood was gushed out. It was sprinkled on the fire stick flying back, with some blood color. Then, when no one saw it, Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s blood quickly seeped in.</p>
<p>Tianya is so powerful that all people are shocked!</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s face was as cold as frost, and he did not hesitate. In a flash of blue light, Tianya mercilessly cut down in the middle of the sky. At this time, the black air on the fire stick suddenly evaporated, especially at the top of the stick. The blue light was even more prosperous. Zhang Xiaofan stood up slowly with blood on his mouth. His face was pale but his eyes were blood. His appearance was ferocious.</p>
<p>After a while, the fire staff rushed to Tianya again in the dark and blue light. Once the two magic weapons contacted in the mid air, they bounced away from each other. Lu Xueqi and Zhang Xiaofan standing at the back were shocked.</p>
<p>In the middle of the sky, the blue light flickers and the blue light is brilliant. It flies in the air. Everywhere it goes, the originally hard huge wood on the challenge arena is scattered like scraps of paper. The sound is loud and deafening like a thunderbolt. Nearly a thousand people of Qingyun sect all changed color. Since the beginning of the big test, there has been no match like today. It was so fierce at the beginning, and the scene is even less grand today. In a moment, such a big challenge arena was demolished by these two powerful magic weapons.</p>
<p>The onlookers back away from the stage. Zhang Xiaofan and Lu Xueqi are floating in the air. Lu Xueqi holds the formula with both hands and controls it with all his strength. His posture is serious and natural. However, Zhang Xiaofan seems strange. Although the power of the fire stick is unexpected, he doesn&rsquo;t hold it like Lu Xueqi The secret is that people are dancing in the middle of the sky, and the fire stick is as quick as lightning, and it&rsquo;s fun to fight with the Tianya.</p>
<p>However, Zhang Xiaofan was hard to tell. The power of Tianya was far beyond his imagination. Every time the fire stick collided with Tianya, his whole body meridians would be shocked. If he hadn&rsquo;t been in Taiji Xuanqing road since he was a child, he had secretly learned the &ldquo;Dafan Prajna&rdquo; skill of Tianyin Temple. The meridians were strong, and the body was protected by Dafan Prajna. He could barely resist the God of Tianya Li, has long been vomiting blood. But looking at Lu Xueqi in front of her, there is nothing different. Under her control, Tianya is getting more and more powerful with blue light, which gradually suppresses the blue light and black Qi of the fire stick.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan in this room is crying, but Lu Xueqi on the other side is also surprised. The other side&rsquo;s ugly fire staff magic weapon has the power to compete with Tianya. It seems that there is a kind of power to absorb Qi. It attracts the essence of the spirit in his body all the time. If it&rsquo;s not solid, I&rsquo;m afraid that I won&rsquo;t be able to suppress the hot blood in his body first.</p>
<p>Thinking about this, Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s heart was full of Qi and blood again, and her body floating in the air almost lost its balance. Her heart was shocked and anxious. From the situation of fighting, she intuitively found that her opponent&rsquo;s practice in taijixuanqingdao was not very high, far inferior to herself, but somehow he used this strange magic weapon so powerful that even Tianya could only watch it Generally speaking, it&rsquo;s the best.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s silver teeth were bitten, his face was pink and his clothes were windless. Zhang Xiaofan was shocked and his staff was slow for a moment after Tianya hit the fire stick in the middle of the air.</p>
<p>At this time, Tianya flies back, Lu Xueqi quickly probes her right hand and holds Tianya. At the moment when her jade like palm touched Tianya, the blue light suddenly engulfed her figure. When Tianya&rsquo;s sword body shook, it made a loud sound like a dragon chant. It rocked up to the sky. Lu Xueqi seemed to integrate with Tianya&rsquo;s sword and soared up to the sky.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan has already forgotten something outside his body in his mind at the moment. He only feels that he is more and more connected with the burning stick in front of him. He even feels that the burning stick is like a living thing. At the moment, he is excited and a strange evil spirit rushes to his mind.</p>
<p>He was in the middle of the sky, howling.</p>
<p>The sound moves four wild, the world changes color!</p>
<p>Black blue light, straight to the sky, strong wind, cloud boiling!</p>
<p>Suddenly, the blue light flashed, a scream from far and near, from quietly can not hear the rapid increase, until deafening, people can no longer hear any sound. Ten thousand blue lights, at this moment, all of them are integrated into one giant light column. I&rsquo;m going to cut the Qingyun Mountain into two parts.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s face is twisted, and all his senses and orifices suddenly bleed in this moment. But there is no fear in his look, and his eyes are bright. He also reaches out and grabs the fire stick. In a moment, the sky is blue and black like holding in his hand, straight to the blue light column rushing down.</p>
<p>On the periphery, the young Qingyun disciples held their breath and looked straight. No one had any contempt for Zhang Xiaofan. Among the elders of the older generation, their faces also changed.</p>
<p>This contest is a battle between life and death.</p>
<p>But somehow no one came out to stop it?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boom&rdquo; is like the thunder in the sky and the world. It seems that the whole Tianfeng is shaking violently. The blue light turns back. Lu Xueqi appears in the sky and holds the Tianya tightly, but a blood slowly flows out of her mouth.</p>
<p>Under the stage, master Shuiyue stands up.</p>
<p>In the middle of the sky, Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s ear was only left with the sound of the wind. His eyes were almost covered by the blur and the red blood. If he could hear the shouts of the outside world, he would hear the shouts of all the people under him.</p>
<p>Su Ru&rsquo;s lips lost their color. Looking at the little apprentice who had almost become a blood man in the middle of the sky, she said to Tian in a hurry and low voice, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not easy. Let Xiao Fan give up. Let him give up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian can&rsquo;t easily shake his body for a while. He stares into the air and slowly shakes his head.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t feel the pain. Zhang Xiaofan suddenly flashed such an idea in his mind in the changeable air. He even thought that, after I died, would elder martial sister come to see me? Many years later, when she was living a happy life, did she also forget me?</p>
<p>He reached out and wiped the blood from the corner of his eyes, and, water!</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi felt pain all over her body. Qi and blood in her body were in conflict with each other in the channels of violent vibration, as if she was going to break through her body, cheering the ferocious devil who rushed to the horrible blue light and black air ahead.</p>
<p>This is the moment of life and death!</p>
<p>This is an eternal moment!</p>
<p>This beautiful woman stands proudly in the strong wind. She refuses to retreat even if the wind is like a knife. She looked up at the sky.</p>
<p>The wind, suddenly stopped, solidified in the air.</p>
<p>The world, suddenly quiet, stopped at this moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boom!&rdquo; The low roar seemed to come from the horizon and reverberate between the whole world.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi backhand, pulled out the &ldquo;Tianya divine sword&rdquo;.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, the blue light in the sky dissipated and contracted, as if the dragon were sucking water into the blade like autumn water.</p>
<p>There was silence on the mountain!</p>
<p>Legend has it that the thousand year old Tianya finally came out of its sheath!</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s face is as cold as frost. She holds the sword Jue in her hand. She even steps seven stars in the air. The long sword suddenly stabs the sky. In an instant, Yu Yan has no trace of blood. She recites the mantra in her mouth:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The nine heavenly xuancha was transformed into a divine thunder.</p>
<p>The glory of heaven, lead it with sword! &quot;</p>
<p>In a moment, the blue sky, which was originally clear, was dark. Suddenly, the dark clouds appeared in the sky. The thunder was rumbling. The edge of the black clouds was constantly flashing with electric light, galloping between the heaven and the earth. There was a mass of killing and strong wind.</p>
<p>When the gale came, Zhang Xiaofan opened his mouth slightly. This scene seemed to appear once in the memory of a long time ago. On the ground, up to immortal daoxuan and down to the first elders of each vein, all of them stood up in amazement, and then turned to look at master Shuiyue of xiaozhufeng.</p>
<p>For a long time, Tian said in a hard voice, &ldquo;what a good apprentice you have taught!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue, however, totally ignored everyone. For the first time, his indifferent face was worried. He looked at the two people in the sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The magic sword is really good for thunder!&rdquo; Immortal daoxuan slowly took back his eyes, and his heart was shocked. Unexpectedly, there was such a great talent among the young generation under the Qingyun gate.</p>
<p>However, looking at the female disciple&rsquo;s face, although she tried to exert such miraculous skills, her body trembled and her face was as white as paper. I&rsquo;m afraid she couldn&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>In the sky, the thunder was more and more urgent. Zhang Xiaofan clearly felt that since the moment when Tianya came out of the sheath, there was an abundant and incomparable power on the fire stick in his hand, just like the magic weapon connected with his flesh and blood was crying from the deep inside.</p>
<p>As if it has been waiting for this moment for thousands of years!</p>
<p>The sky is blacker, the dark clouds press against the top, and a huge whirlpool slowly appears in the thick clouds.</p>
