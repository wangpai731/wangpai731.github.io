<p>Tongtianfeng, ancestral hall.</p>
<p>The old man guarding the ancestral hall is still holding his broken broom in his hand, standing at the gate of the ancestral hall and looking out. There was a strange expression on the wrinkled face, which seemed to have some expectation and a little excitement.</p>
<p>The open space outside the hall is empty, but if you look carefully, you will find that there are many strange Charms around the open space than usual. They are pasted on the tree trunks around, or hiding under the grass and stones. Each Rune paper is about half a foot apart. It seems that they are not related to each other. In fact, they form a mysterious array, which separates the open space from the surrounding areas.</p>
<p>The sun is warm. From the sky, there is no difference between inside and outside the array. Generally, it is illuminated by the sun.</p>
<p>But the next moment, suddenly there was a sharp sound, from the above the open space suddenly remembered. Standing at the door of the ancestral temple, the old man looked up and held the broom hand, and subconsciously tightened it.</p>
<p>A strange darkness suddenly appeared from the top of the open space, covering the air space in a flash, and instantly dyed the surrounding area with a heavy sense of killing. However, the darkness is only in this open space, to be exact, it is only in the array formed by the surrounding runes. Obviously, the strange array around is used by the high man to bind the power in it.</p>
<p>In the middle of the sky, the black air became more and more thick, which made people feel as if they were in the nine hell. But at the next moment, a dragon song and a long cry came out of the black air. However, the blue light was shining and burst out of the black air. In a flash, the black gas was completely eliminated.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu, holding the dragon sword in his hand, appeared in the sky in the sky. The blue light was shining from his body. However, he saw his eyes shining brightly, and the man and sword were in one. He rushed down from the sky.</p>
<p>The sword of chopping dragon carries thousands of rays. It roared and roared with great momentum. It was still high in the sky, and the ground was dusty. Sand and stone fly away. As Lin Jingyu&rsquo;s body shot down like electricity, the side of his body seemed to be burning flames out of thin air because of his speed and momentum.</p>
<p>He looked like a god of war, desperate and full of fighting spirit, flying down.</p>
<p>The old man&rsquo;s lips suddenly began to tremble slightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boom</p>
<p>The huge roar came in an instant.</p>
<p>The ground hit by the power of this magic Dharma sent out pain * *, and in a moment, the surface of the array was fragmented, and stones of all sizes broke away from the ground and rose into the sky one after another. The bright blue light in the center of that force has penetrated deep into the earth.</p>
<p>All kinds of runes around the open space, including the mysterious Charms painted on them, suddenly lit up together. In the air, there is a mysterious mantra sound, which sounds like a whisper. The invisible power spreads out and envelops this huge destructive force. No diarrhea.</p>
<p>Outside the array of Dharma, the sun is warm and the vegetation is leisurely, but inside the array, it is like a storm.</p>
<p>This is the magic scene outside the ancestral hall of Qingyun Mountain.</p>
<p>In the distance, a dark green figure, looking at it from afar, stood still with his hands.</p>
<p>The storm in the array gradually subsided. Inspired by the great power, the sand and dust fall one after another. The cracks on the ground and the huge deep hole still record the earth shaking blow just now.</p>
<p>Standing on the face of the old man at the entrance of the ancestral hall, the corners of his mouth moved. Finally, there was a smile. In the depth of his eyes, there seems to be a deep trace of comfort.</p>
<p>After a whistling sound, Lin Jingyu jumped out of the pit with his dragon sword in his hand. His body was covered with dust, and even his handsome face was stained with a bit. As soon as he fell to the ground, he began to gasp. But above the face, but still can not help but excited expression.</p>
<p>He looked up and looked at the old man standing at the gate of the ancestral hall.</p>
<p>The old man&rsquo;s mouth, with a trace of smile, slowly raised his hand to him, gently waved.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu gasped a little, and walked quickly to the old man. Zhan Yan called out: &ldquo;master, I&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man nodded with a smile, his eyes fixed on him, full of gratification and affection, and said in a low voice, &ldquo;you are very well, really good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that, he slowly looked up at the sky and said leisurely, &ldquo;even if it was me, I would not be much faster than you when I finished this real sword formula of&rdquo; killing ghosts and gods. &quot;</p>
<p>With a &ldquo;brush&rdquo; sound, Lin Jingyu inserted the dragon sword back into its scabbard. His excitement still lingered on his face and said, &ldquo;master, if it wasn&rsquo;t for your guidance, I really don&rsquo;t know when I&rsquo;ll be able to practice this unique Dharma!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man &ldquo;hum&rdquo; a, his face showed a trace of disdain, light way: &ldquo;today&rsquo;s Qingyun gate, in addition to daoxuan, is not easy, and your former master Cang song is OK, the other elders are all bad guys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu is stunned. He has been learning art from this mysterious ancestral hall for more than ten years. Over the years, with every point of his practice, he has a deeper admiration for the old man. He really feels that the old man has opened up a world he never knew before. In fact, he can practice Taoism in this way.</p>
<p>On weekdays, Lin Jingyu got along with the old man for a long time, and the old man loved him more and more. He talked to him more and more, which naturally involved some people who commented on the world. At this moment, the old man&rsquo;s tone was unexpectedly arrogant, as if looking at the world, few people could enter his Dharma.</p>
<p>At first, although Lin Jingyu did not dare to refute, he was still somewhat unconvinced in his heart. However, with the deepening of his practice, he felt that the old man was really unfathomable, and that he was so arrogant that he naturally had his reason. With his way of doing, how many people in the world could really be regarded by him?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that he always looks down on the fat uncle Tian of dazhufeng. He is afraid that there are some reasons why Tian is not easy to scold Zhang Xiaofan at the beginning. He can&rsquo;t help but say: &ldquo;master, I think that Tian is not easy to be ordinary. What&rsquo;s the big deal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man looked at him, shook his head and said, &ldquo;what do you know, young man? Tian is not easy to see. His appearance is not amazing, but he has a talent for cultivating Taoism. He has a strong and persistent nature, which is far beyond ordinary people&rsquo;s ability. This is particularly important after the deepening of his practice. In those years, he had been ordinary since he was introduced. Once he got the guidance and enlightenment, the practice of Taoism would have gone a long way. On the contrary, his achievements still lie in those senior brothers and sisters who look down on him</p>
<p>He snorted again coldly and said, &ldquo;nine out of ten people in this world are mediocre, just like the old days of Tianyun and Shang Zhengliang. What do you know? &quot;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu was silent, but seeing that the old man&rsquo;s face was gloomy and arrogant, he even regarded Taoist Tianyun and other famous Qingyun leaders as rubbish. If it was spread to the outside world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a shocking joke, but somehow, Lin Jingyu hears it at the moment, but he doesn&rsquo;t even have a suspicion.</p>
<p>The old man turned his head and looked at Lin Jingyu and said, &ldquo;although you can do this, you can kill ghosts and gods.&rdquo;. However, the real sword formula of this move is fierce to the Yang. Although it is powerful, it also consumes a lot of energy. You are gifted. You can cultivate this method at a young age, but you still need to practice it constantly to be able to use it freely. You should not use this true sword formula until you are in a critical situation. &quot;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu knelt down in front of him and said respectfully, &ldquo;yes, I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man lifted him up. He looked at him and said, &ldquo;in the world today, there are only&rdquo; the true formula of the divine sword against thunder &ldquo;in Qingyun gate, which is the supreme true dharma of Qingyun sect. In fact, what kind of person was the founder of our school? He sorted out the Taoist methods handed down by his predecessors, and learned them from the anonymous ancient scroll. In total, he handed down four types of true dharma sword rhymes, which one is not The most powerful Dharma? &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Lin Jingyu was surprised and said. &ldquo;And so on. My master, he He never told me before</p>
<p>The old man shook his head slightly and said, &ldquo;your master doesn&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu&rsquo;s surprise is extraordinary. He was in the Qingyun gate. It&rsquo;s just one person under ten thousand people. But the old man said that he didn&rsquo;t know about it, but actually Taoist Cangsong didn&rsquo;t tell him.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu is more curious about the origin of the old man&rsquo;s identity.</p>
<p>The old man&rsquo;s eyes, full of vicissitudes of life, only turned around his face to know the young man&rsquo;s mind. But he didn&rsquo;t say anything. Instead, he frowned suddenly, as if he had noticed something moving. His eyes suddenly looked into the distance.</p>
<p>After a moment, he took back his eyes, his face was a little strange, and then said faintly, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s late, you go back first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu was really reluctant to part with him, but he had always been so respectful to the old man that he didn&rsquo;t dare to listen to him. He straightened up and knelt down and kowtowed three times before he left.</p>
<p>The old man was only left in the field soon. He was silent for a long time, and his body was bent back again. He staggered to one side, and the broom danced. The dust rose. While sweeping up the dust of the stones, the mysterious charms in the secret places were swept up by him like nothing and floated into the dust.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>After sorting out the open space, the stones were randomly filled in the pit made by Lin Jingyu. It seemed that the old man was panting and tired. After standing for a while, he slowly turned around and walked back to the main hall of the ancestral hall.</p>
<p>In the hall of the ancestral hall, it is still as quiet and dark as ever. In front of the innumerable souls worshipped in the deep of the temple, the flickering candles are burning soundlessly.</p>
<p>But at this moment, there is a figure standing in front of those spiritual places.</p>
<p>The man, dressed in a dark green Taoist robe, is the real man daoxuan, the leader of Qingyun sect.</p>
<p>When Taoist priest heard the sound of footsteps, he turned his head to look at the old man&rsquo;s place, but he didn&rsquo;t say anything. He turned his head and looked at the Lingpai&rsquo;s Lingpai. Then he took a step, took three sticks of incense on the sacrificial table in front of the Lingpai, lit them on the nearby candlelight, held the incense respectfully for three times, and put the incense in the incense burner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t come to offer incense for some time,&rdquo; immortal daoxuan said quietly and slowly, as if to a very old friend. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if the ancestors will blame me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man standing behind him waddled up, leaned the broom aside, picked up a rag, gently wiped the dust off the sacrificial table, and whispered, &ldquo;you have made my Qingyun gate vivid and colorful. It&rsquo;s too late for all the grandmasters to be happy. How can you blame you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Daoxuan real person light smile, turn to look at him, suddenly way: &ldquo;you seem to be a few minutes old again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man&rsquo;s body stopped for a moment, then he wiped the table again, and did not return to the way: &ldquo;even those whose hearts are dead, naturally the old ones are faster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan looked at the old man in silence and did not speak any more. The old man slowly and carefully wiped the sacrificial table, put the dishcloth aside, turned to face the immortal daoxuan, looked at him for a while, and suddenly said, &ldquo;did you see all of them just now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan nodded silently and sighed: &ldquo;the child&rsquo;s quality is really high. But, &ldquo;his voice seemed to be a little louder,&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t expect that you would pass on &ldquo;beheading ghosts and gods&rdquo; to him. &quot;</p>
<p>The old man snorted. He said: &ldquo;the child&rsquo;s temperament and aptitude are all good. In this case, why not spread it? Are they all hidden in the body like you.</p>
<p>Dead, take it to the coffin? &quot;</p>
<p>Daoxuan&rsquo;s face changed and he seemed to be angry. But somehow, facing the old man, he was a leader respected by all the right ways in the world. It was such sarcastic words that he just changed his face and immediately resisted it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way, I have one more thing to tell you.&rdquo; Daoxuan immortal light way.</p>
<p>The old man raised his head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just a frail old man. What&rsquo;s the matter</p>
<p>Daoxuan was really humane: &ldquo;today, later, the master of incense Valley, Yun Yilan, will lead his disciples to come to Qingyun Mountain to worship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man suddenly frowned and said, &ldquo;cloud Yi Lan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you still remember him?&rdquo; he said with a smile</p>
<p>The old man sneered and turned his head. His voice suddenly became a little meaningful and said, &ldquo;that man, but an old skilful&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Southern Xinjiang. Qilidong mountain range.</p>
<p>Here is a rolling mountain range, with qilidong Valley as the center, extending around. For a long time, these mountains are full of forests and green mountains and rivers. But now it has completely lost its original appearance.</p>
<p>The cold wind came down from the sky, whistling through the mountains, like ghosts crying. The sky is full of black clouds, the pressure is very low, a bit like the Li people invaded qilidong on that day, but the prestige is far from comparable.</p>
<p>And in the forest where there were all kinds of birds and beasts. At the moment, it has completely changed into a hell on earth. There are all kinds of strange monsters and alien races everywhere, and there are dead bodies of birds and beasts. It&rsquo;s a bloody scene.</p>
<p>With a long cry, a clear shadow flies from the distance, and a few ups and downs come to the front. It is the green dragon.</p>
<p>His face was grim, and his clothes were covered with blood. As the strong wind swept by, he stopped on a branch that came out of the way, looked around him, and then looked behind him.</p>
<p>Suddenly, there was a piercing howl among the trees in the plain forest. The huge white bone demon snake rose into the air. The figure of the green dragon in front of him was reflected in his two huge eyes, and he roared and jumped up. And immediately after it, black smoke billows, roars, bursts like tide, actually is innumerable monster swarm to rush to green dragon.</p>
<p>Not long ago, the place where the Miao people of qilidong lived was suddenly surrounded by numerous monsters and beasts. The leader was this terrible monster, the White Bone Demon snake.</p>
<p>This White Bone Demon snake has a huge body. It is flapping white bones where it passes, and it is beaten out by the side of human and animal. Moreover, it can emit poison gas and kill people. As for other ordinary monsters, it is also extremely powerful and cruel.</p>
<p>Although the Miao people are brave and brave, they are no match for these monsters. In a flash, qilidong becomes a hell on earth and a slaughterhouse. Seeing that the situation was not good, Qinglong immediately asked Tu Magu, the leader of the Miao nationality, to withdraw the remaining Miao people to the altar. The witches in those altars knew some witchcraft of Southern Xinjiang and could resist for a while. However, he rushed forward to attack the White Bone Demon snake by surprise. At the same time, he connected heavy hands with quick body method to kill the monster. As expected, he attracted most of the demons&rsquo; attention to himself.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that the other monsters are OK, but the White Bone Demon snake is very important. He can&rsquo;t win with such Taoist deeds as Qinglong and the &ldquo;heaven and earth Qingguang ring&rdquo; in his body. In addition, there were more and more monsters around him, and the pressure on Qinglong was increasing. He was shocked. He also had the intention to lead away these monsters. He took aim at the sky and fled to the mountain. As expected, he attracted many demons, including the White Bone Demon snake.</p>
<p>However, since he wanted to lead away the demons, he didn&rsquo;t want to fly up from the sky and only flew on the forest ground. To his surprise, it seemed that the wild animals and birds all over the mountains and fields had undergone strange changes. They were either killed or turned into extremely aggressive monsters. Wherever they went, they would appear and would be attacked, which was really difficult to deal with.</p>
<p>At this moment, the Green Dragon flew up again, avoiding the blow of the huge tail of the angry white bone demon snake. However, he saw that three or four giant trees that had lived for many years were swept aside by the monster as if they were withered and decayed, making a clattering noise. During this period, many smaller monsters were hit directly, and the howling sound was heard everywhere.</p>
<p>The White Bone Demon snake watched the green dragon fly up. The head of the snake rose to the sky and roared. Suddenly, three pairs of wings vibrated. The huge body flew up and flew to the green dragon.</p>
<p>Qinglong was surprised. Although he saw that the monster had three pairs of wings at the beginning, the huge figure really flew up, and the momentum was amazing. For a while, he saw the huge body sprawling down.</p>
<p>However, Qinglong is not a mortal after all. He ranks first among the four holy envoys of the ghost King clan. Naturally, he has something extraordinary. Seeing his body twist, he goes through the cracks of the White Bone Demon snake&rsquo;s body and flies in the opposite direction to qilidong.</p>
<p>The White Bone Demon snake roared and chased after him.</p>
<p>Qinglong flies for a while. After all, his Taoism is profound. He gradually casts away the White Bone Demon snake and other monsters. At a glance, the distance is also relatively far. In his mind, he is planning to get rid of these monsters and return to qilidong to see how the situation of the Miao people is?</p>
<p>At this time, he suddenly saw a purple light flash through the woods under him. Then blood splashed, and the roar of monsters came one after another. At the same time, the monsters in all directions rushed to the place under him.</p>
<p>Looking from the air, countless ferocious monsters come with open teeth and claws, like an endless evil sea, surging and surging, which is really soul stirring.</p>
<p>And among them, there is a woman&rsquo;s fury.</p>
<p>Qinglong moved in his heart and turned several thoughts like lightning in his heart. Finally, he broke down and went to have a look.</p>
<p>As soon as I entered the woods, I could only smell the smell of the smell. Everywhere were the corpses of monsters lying on the ground in pieces, with fresh blood splashing everywhere. There was a woman like man fighting with countless monsters not far away. In his hand, a magic weapon with a purple light shining in his hand, which was full of sharpness, was extraordinary.</p>
<p>The green dragon&rsquo;s eyes shrunk and lost his voice: &ldquo;Purple awn blade Are you the Golden Vase</p>
<p>The woman seemed to be surprised, looked back, and her body floated over, but there was no pause in her hand. The purple light twinkled and stretched, and killed three monsters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; Gold bottle son falls to green dragon side, coldly way.</p>
<p>Qinglong wondered why he didn&rsquo;t resist the sky when he was practicing Taoism. Once in the sky, only a few of these monsters could go to heaven. Isn&rsquo;t it so simple?</p>
<p>In spite of this thought, Qinglong is still ready to answer. He and Jin pinger are both shocked at the same time. If they feel something, they look forward together.</p>
<p>Just now, countless monsters, who were still in a crazy state, suddenly retreated like the tide. But in the deep forest in front of them, a cold sense of killing poured in. This invisible cold killing idea made the two figures of such high moral conduct unable to resist a cold war.</p>
<p>In the heart of Qinglong, there is such a terrible thing in the south of Xinjiang!</p>
