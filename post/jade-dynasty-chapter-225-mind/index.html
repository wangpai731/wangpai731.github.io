      <p>A burst of coughing was heard nearby. The sound was not loud, but it seemed a little urgent. When Lu Xueqi and his party looked at the place where the sound was made, they saw that Tian Bu Yi, sitting on the stone steps, showed a trace of pain on his face and coughed constantly.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi frowned slightly, with a trace of worry in her eyes. She had already reached the point where all kinds of diseases could not be invaded by Tian Buyi, let alone this small cough. Obviously, Tian Buyi&rsquo;s body had some trauma at the moment.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi was silent, but the little ring standing on one side quietly stepped forward.</p>
<p>Tian Buyi was surprised. He looked up at Xiaohuan. Xiaohuan laughed and said, &ldquo;this Master, I said, &ldquo;thank you for saving me, my grandfather and Taoist priest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Buyi&rsquo;s face showed a little smile, tired in a light way: &ldquo;a little bit of small things, nothing to mention, but this is not the place you have been waiting for a long time. If there is nothing else, leave quickly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Monday, Xian Lian nodded and said, &ldquo;yes, yes, what he said is very true, Xiaohuan, let&rsquo;s go quickly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Small ring white her grandfather one eye, to field not easy way: &ldquo;elder, your body does not matter, what need I help?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi shook his head and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not in a big way. You two just go. Otherwise, if that person comes back, I&rsquo;m afraid you two will not have such good luck to escape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, suddenly, a trace of black flitted across his fat face, and his face showed pain again. He coughed again, and his voice seemed to be a bit hoarse than before.</p>
<p>Standing alone on one side, the Lich looked at Tian Buyi all the time. On his face covered with black cloth, only one pair of eyes revealed a thoughtful look.</p>
<p>Xiaohuan couldn&rsquo;t help but urged by Zhouxian. At the same time, he didn&rsquo;t seem to be able to help. He bowed his head to tianbuyi to say goodbye, and then walked out with Zhouxian and the wild dog Taoist.</p>
<p>But after a few steps, she could not help but look at the Lich standing on the side. As if he found something, he was stunned for a moment and said to the immortal on Monday, &ldquo;look at that man, grandfather. How to dress and me Is that master as like as two peas? &quot;</p>
<p>Monday immortal did not respond for a moment. He was shocked and said, &ldquo;what master Eh After a pause, Monday fairy narrowed his eyes, looked at the Lich and pondered for a moment.</p>
<p>He said: &ldquo;there are so many monsters under the sky. It&rsquo;s hard to guarantee that a few of them are with you Don&rsquo;t pay attention to the person who is similar to the master who pretends to be a ghost. Let&rsquo;s go now! &quot;</p>
<p>Xiao Huan answered and went with him. But he couldn&rsquo;t help but look back at the Lich. It seemed that the Lich didn&rsquo;t notice the three people on Monday immortal&rsquo;s side. He just stood there silently and looked at the field.</p>
<p>Soon, Monday fairy, Xiao Huan and wild dog Taoist also left the abandoned villa. The place, which was originally desolate, suddenly became more desolate. The attention of Tian Buyi and Lu Xueqi soon turned to the mysterious man in black.</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi said faintly: &ldquo;have you ever had something to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Lich was silent for a while. His eyes moved from Tian Buyi to Lu Xueqi, and finally to Tian Buyi. Later, he seemed to stop talking. At last, he didn&rsquo;t say a word, and his body floated back. Quietly into the darkness of the night.</p>
<p>The night wind was cold, blowing from afar, and there was no one in the abandoned villa for a moment. Even the common insects in the wild can&rsquo;t be heard. It&rsquo;s dead.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s heart did not know how, suddenly a burst of uneasiness.</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi looks up at the sky for a long time. He seems to be thinking about something.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi did not know why he suddenly lost his mind and did not dare to disturb him for a moment. However, after a long time, he did not see any movement from Tian Buyi, and worried about whether he was injured or not. Just as he was about to ask, Tian Bu Yi suddenly lowered his head, and then a burst of coughing was more severe than before.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi was startled and didn&rsquo;t know what to do. She had to ask, &ldquo;Uncle Tian, are you ok?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Field not easy cough for a long time, this just slowly stopped, it seems to be to ease the breath. He shook his hand slowly to show that he was not in any way.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi couldn&rsquo;t help but say, &ldquo;Uncle Tian, this is not far from our Qingyun Mountain. I think we&rsquo;d better go back to Qingyun first, and then we&rsquo;ll have a long-term discussion after meeting all the teachers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi listened to Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s Kuo and frowned. He seemed to suddenly think of something. He turned his head and looked at Lu Xueqi and said, &ldquo;how are you, uncle Su Ru, on the big bamboo peak since I left?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi nodded: &ldquo;they are all OK, but everyone does not know where you are going, so they are very anxious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian not easy to smile, as if put down a big stone in his heart, but that smile, but vaguely revealed a trace of bitterness.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi looked at Tian Buyi&rsquo;s expression in her eyes, hesitated for a moment, and tried to say, &ldquo;Uncle Tian, just now those people have said that you are fighting with a demon. Who is that demon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian not easy to see Lu Xueqi one eye, frown, did not say Kuo.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi met his eyes, and suddenly found that in addition to haggard, there seemed to be a trace of dark air on his face, which should not have appeared on him.</p>
<p>Is it the strange magic method that imprisoned him hurt his internal Qi? Lu Xueqi was secretly worried, but there was another more important thing in front of her, which made her unable to face it.</p>
<p>She hesitated for a moment, and finally whispered, but clearly asked Tian Bu Yi, &ldquo;that man But master daoxuan</p>
<p>The field is not easy the body one shakes, the double eye suddenly shoots out frightening person Jing Guang, the cold voice way: &ldquo;what do you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi said in a hurry: &ldquo;before I went down the mountain, I had to get my teacher&rsquo;s trust. I told her a story about her old man and uncle Tian and uncle Su in the ancestral hall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi was stunned for a moment, his face was stunned, but then he finally eased down. After a long time, he sighed and said, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe she told you about the water moon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi said: &ldquo;my teacher is because master daoxuan and uncle Tian are missing at the same time, and the Qingyun gate is in chaos. She is very worried that the elder martial uncle daoxuan has been trapped by demons, but elder martial brother Xiao Yicai clearly does not know about it, so she can&rsquo;t make a decision at the moment. She will take care of the situation on Qingyun Mountain and ask her disciples to go down the mountain to look for two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi was silent for a moment and said, &ldquo;if you find the master master master at the foot of the mountain, and if he is as worried as your master is, will Shuiyue tell you. What should you do? &quot;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s face slightly pale, as if this secret to her, is also a great burden, in the field is not easy to look at. After taking a deep breath, she resolutely said: &ldquo;before I went down the mountain, I had been to the ancestral hall of tongtianfeng with my master. Before the spiritual position of the ancestors of Qingyun gate, she made a solemn oath: if it is true, it can&rsquo;t be done. For the sake of the reputation of Qingyun gate for thousands of years, the disciple should be determined to die, never show mercy, and never reveal a trace of this matter. &quot;</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi looked at Lu Xueqi deeply. At last, he nodded slowly, but he sighed: &ldquo;although I don&rsquo;t like Shuiyue as a human being, I can&rsquo;t help saying that she has really taught a good disciple.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi had no expression, lowered her head, and said, &ldquo;Uncle Tian, you have been praised.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi said: &ldquo;in the second generation of Qingyun gate disciples. There are no less than a thousand people. If you look around, how many people can shoulder such a heavy responsibility. Alas&hellip; &quot; He was silent for a while, and then continued: &ldquo;you guessed well. The man I was fighting with here a few days ago is your master, daoxuan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although Lu Xueqi had already guessed it vaguely, her own ears heard Tian not easy to say so. Her body was still one of the shocks. After a long time. Then he whispered, &ldquo;well The body of the old master of the corpse</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi hummed, shook his head, and sighed, &ldquo;he has been deeply mired in mud and is hard to extricate himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi was silent.</p>
<p>Tian is not easy for a moment. Then he said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a long story, but since you already know the reason, I have nothing to hide from you. First of all, I found that elder martial brother daoxuan was possessed by demons. Then I went to Tongtian peak and ended up in the ancestral hall. As expected, he really Later, in the ancestral hall, we had a fight, but although he was possessed by the devil, his conduct did not diminish much. At the end of the fight, I was still restrained by him. &quot;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi listened, but she was secretly surprised. She knew and saw the practice of Taoism between Tian Buyi and daoxuan. The two top figures of Qingyun gate were fighting in the back mountain of Tongtian peak. The fierce battle situation can be imagined. Although Tian&rsquo;s words seem to be understatement at the moment, the scene at that time is not hard to imagine.</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi, with a wry smile on his face, said: &ldquo;I should go. I should have been ready to wake up elder martial brother daoxuan. That&rsquo;s the best. However, it can&rsquo;t be. I have to do my best. When my master Shuiyue and I overheard this secret in the ancestral hall, I heard elder martial brother wan say that after being possessed by demons, the humanitarian association would be greatly weakened because of the Demon power. Naturally, I knew that elder martial brother daoxuan&rsquo;s Taoism was more profound than mine. What we should think of is that in case of any accident, we should die together. After all, it must not be disclosed. &quot;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi was very respectful in her heart and said from the bottom of her heart: &ldquo;Uncle Tian&rsquo;s heart can be proved by the moon. All the ancestors will surely protect you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Buyi shook his head and said, &ldquo;who knows, after I started fighting with elder martial brother daoxuan, I found that although he was possessed by the devil, his conduct was still as deep as usual. After several fierce struggles, I was still defeated and captured. But for some reason, he didn&rsquo;t mean to kill me. Instead, he took me down the mountain secretly and came to this ghost deserted villa and imprisoned me here</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi was reminded by him and quickly asked, &ldquo;Uncle Tian, are you injured? I think you look very bad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi was stunned for a moment. He didn&rsquo;t seem to understand the meaning of Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s words. However, he immediately understood the meaning of Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s words, and said to himself, &ldquo;who was stuffed into that coffin and closed so many times, naturally there would be no good look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi frowned. She was still a little uneasy in her heart, but she couldn&rsquo;t tell what was wrong for a moment. She had to be silent.</p>
<p>Field not easy to see her one eye, way: &ldquo;this matter roughly you all know, now you have what plan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi frowned and said, &ldquo;excuse me, uncle Tian, then Where is master daoxuan now? &quot;</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi shook his head and said, &ldquo;after he became a demon, he could not guess what he did. He often left us alone and came back after several days. It seems that he just left the villa yesterday. I&rsquo;m afraid it will take a few more days to come back, but I&rsquo;m not sure. Sometimes he will come back every other day. &quot;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi hesitated for a moment and said, &ldquo;Uncle Tian, it&rsquo;s better for us to go back to the mountain first, although it&rsquo;s not appropriate to publicize it. But as long as you find my mentor and uncle Su Ru, you two and three teachers will discuss together and think there will be a better way. &quot;</p>
<p>Tian was not easy to be silent for a moment, but finally shook his head and said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not right. First of all, elder martial brother daoxuan is deeply possessed and his mind has changed greatly. No one can predict what he will do; second, if we return to the mountain, we will lose his whereabouts. What is to be done? &quot;</p>
<p>He stopped for a moment and said, &ldquo;well, it&rsquo;s better that you go back to the mountain first, tell Shuiyue and your uncle Su Ru what happened, and then let them come quickly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi hesitated for a moment and said, &ldquo;if master daoxuan comes back tonight, what should I do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Field not easy faint smile, did not speak immediately, but slowly stood up. He was short and fat, and his appearance was not excellent. But for some reason, he stood so casually, but he had his own prestige, awe inspiring and respectful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you come to practice all your life?&rdquo; Tian is not easy to whisper: &ldquo;a man&rsquo;s body, how can he be timid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi also quietly stood up behind him. For a long time, in her eyes, Tian was not easy, except that she was once the mentor of that person. It seems that there is nothing worth her attention any more, but at this moment, she really respects this elder martial uncle. As soon as she bit her teeth, Lang said, &ldquo;Uncle Tian. You just got out of trouble, you still need to sit still and rest. Tonight, I will protect your Dharma. Tomorrow morning, I will go back to Qingyun and tell my master and uncle Su Ru that they are going down the mountain. In case master daoxuan is sure to return tonight&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>Tian is not easily surprised. Hearing this, she took a look at Lu Xueqi and said, &ldquo;how about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi smiles and looks more beautiful in the night breeze. She says, &ldquo;Uncle Tian is not the only one in Qingyun. You can treat death as if you were dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian is not easy to look at Lu Xueqi for a long time, clapped his hands and said with a smile: &ldquo;well said, well said, good sentence, like death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi said with a faint smile, &ldquo;Uncle Tian, you should sit down and adjust your breath quickly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The field is not easy to say, just nodded, sat on the mossy stone steps again, closed his eyes. Lu Xueqi looked around and saw that the night was chilly and the wind was cool. It was hard to find a ghost, not to mention human figures. The night is deep, and who knows what kind of day it will be tomorrow? She did not want to think more, but also sat down at the head of the field and closed her eyes.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how long she has been sitting like this. Although she hasn&rsquo;t opened her eyes, her breath is flowing in her body. She seems to be able to feel the plants and plants far and near outside her body, just like seeing them with her own eyes. She had some consolation in her heart. When she said these words, she often wandered and suffered from Acacia. However, she seemed to be more advanced and did not waste her life. However, she immediately found that although her mind was as fresh as before, she did not know why it was not easy for Tian, who had been sitting beside her all the time. She did not seem to have any effect on him. She could not even notice the heartbeat that he should have.</p>
<p>In Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s heart, she paid homage to Tian Bu Yi. It seems that all of these elder Qingyun elders are really amazing. Her heart is chasing like thinking, suddenly hear Tian Bu Yi&rsquo;s voice, way: &ldquo;Lu Shi nephew&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi opened her eyes and said, &ldquo;Uncle Tian, please call me Xueqi.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian not easy to see her, eyes flash a ray of light, seems to have deep meaning, slowly nodded, way: &ldquo;Xueqi.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi said with a smile: &ldquo;yes, uncle Tian, what can I do for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi&rsquo;s eyes moved away from her without saying anything at once. Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s heart was a little strange. Tian Bu Yi&rsquo;s eyes seemed to drift. After a long time, he just heard him suddenly say, &ldquo;do you know the old seven apprentice under my door who is not good at all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi jumped. For a while, she was calm. She felt at a loss. Even under her white cheek, two pieces of pale pink flew up.</p>
<p>Forced to hold back the faster heartbeat, Lu Xueqi managed to calm down, but there was still some embarrassment and shyness in her expression. She said in a low voice: &ldquo;yes, uncle Tian, how did you suddenly ask about this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi was expressionless. He could not tell whether he was happy or angry. He seemed to be talking about something irrelevant to him. He said faintly: &ldquo;I heard that over the years, you have been walking down the mountain and have a good friendship with Lao Qi. Moreover, you have been punished by your master several times because of his relationship. Even once, you were in front of the public in front of senior brother daoxuan and your master. Did you refuse the personal offer from the master of burning incense Valley? &quot;</p>
<p>At the moment, Lu Xueqi is completely confused about why Tian Buyi suddenly said something about her intention, but her own cheek was burning, and she thought she was blushing, and her heart was even more confused. It seems that she talked about this matter in front of the unfamiliar Tian Bu Yi, but she was more flustered than her teacher Shuiyue.</p>
<p>“…… Yes, &ldquo;Lu Xueqi became hesitant for the first time and stammered. She was stunned for a long time and then whispered:&rdquo; but I refuse to propose marriage, it&rsquo;s not all for him. I didn&rsquo;t like it, so I just</p>
<p>Tian is not easy to cut off her words suddenly, directly asked: &ldquo;do you like my family seven?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s brain in a hum, only feel that the face is more hot, she looked at the field is not easy to see, only Tian Buyi is staring at her.</p>
<p>Under that gaze, Lu Xueqi unexpectedly suddenly did not know where the courage, suddenly sat up straight body, deeply inhaled after. It is not easy to look at the field with a straight eye</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes</p>
<p>This sound is like breaking ice and cutting snow, clear and sweet, and without half a minute of hesitation and repetition, like the clear eyes in her eyes, there will be no impurity.</p>
<p>Field not easy a corner of the mouth a grin, but let out a loud laugh, he smiles unscrupulously, is heartily happy.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi listened to his smile, but she was shy. But unknowingly, she felt even more cordial to this short and fat uncle.</p>
<p>When the field is not easy to laugh, she looks at Lu Xueqi again. Lu Xueqi just slightly smile, but then it is a burst of inexplicable sadness, whispered: &ldquo;unfortunately, he is now I&rsquo;m afraid you can&rsquo;t accommodate him. If only he could go back to Qingyun again</p>
<p>The field is not easy to blame an eye to turn, coldly way: &ldquo;what return. I&rsquo;ve never said I&rsquo;ve kicked this crap out</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi is stunned. She doesn&rsquo;t understand the meaning of Tian Bu Yi for a moment. She looks up to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, don&rsquo;t you just worry about your master?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi lowered her head and said for a long time, &ldquo;master, she is good for me, and she is not wrong. It is me who is wrong. I understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian is not easy to suddenly &ldquo;bah&rdquo; a, this some rude behavior is to frighten Lu Xueqi a jump, raise an eye to field not easy to see. Tian Bu Yi took a glance in the direction of Qingyun Mountain and said, &ldquo;I think that your master is more and more like your mother-in-law who was really Chushi in those years. I can&rsquo;t figure out what to do with everything. However, she still likes to take care of the students&rsquo; thoughts. Is it possible that she is just as confused as her master</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi said angrily, &ldquo;Uncle Tian, how can you talk nonsense?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi took a look at Lu Xueqi and laughed. Then he waved his hand and said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t worry. After this, your business will be on me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi was stunned and said, &ldquo;what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Buyi sneered: &ldquo;you are not the only one. Do you have a senior sister named Wenmin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi nodded and said, &ldquo;yes, senior sister Wen Min, she In fact, she is somewhat close to elder martial brother song Daren of dazhufeng. &quot; At this point, she couldn&rsquo;t help but smile at the corners of her mouth.</p>
<p>Field not easy to stare at her one eye, not good gas way: &ldquo;Song Daren that is also a wooden fish head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi chuckled and said, &ldquo;when elder martial sister Wenmin talked to us privately about elder martial brother song, she really said that all the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi shook his head. It seemed that he was quite dissatisfied with the honest and honest big disciple. He did not know if song Daren had lost his face. Then he said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t worry, I will go to xiaozhufeng in person in the future and ask your master to marry you for these two incompetent fellows under my family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as she said this, Lu Xueqi was full of bars, which was something she had never done before. In her impatience, she had to say angrily: &ldquo;Uncle Tian, if you tease my disciples again, I will be angry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi looked at her and said, &ldquo;what I said is really Kuo. When did I tease you? Are you not willing to marry us seven? &quot;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi said in a hurry: &ldquo;no Oh, no, I didn&rsquo;t mean that. I mean&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>Tian not easy chubby face, the eye blinked a few blink, solemnly way: &ldquo;then what do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi was suffocated for a moment. She didn&rsquo;t know what to say. She didn&rsquo;t know whether her face was anxious or shy. Under her white skin, she was pink, and she had a thrilling beauty.</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi smiles and says, &ldquo;well, I won&rsquo;t say much. I think you are also a smart woman. What do I mean? You should understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi breathed deeply and calmed down slowly. There was still a touch of rouge like color on her beautiful face. However, her eyes were as clear and bright as before. After a moment, she nodded slowly and firmly and said, &ldquo;yes, brother Sheng understands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian was not easy to stare at her, and then asked, &ldquo;would you like to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pink on Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s cheek seemed to be a deeper layer, but this time, she was calm, just like the general, and said: &ldquo;yes!&rdquo; (to be continued. )</p>
