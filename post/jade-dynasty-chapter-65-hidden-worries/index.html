      <p>Zhang Xiaofan looks at the middle-aged scholar in front of him, the &ldquo;ghost king&rdquo; who is suffering from serious problems. His mind is in chaos. These days, from time to time in his heart, he has little doubts about his past beliefs, which are actually rooted in a conversation in the tea stall at the foot of kongsang mountain.</p>
<p>Now, seeing the old man again, this mood is really complicated, which almost makes him forget the situation here and now for a while.</p>
<p>But even if he forgets, the people next to him will not.</p>
<p>Xiao Zhou reached out to wipe the blood off his mouth, barely stood up, and whispered to Zhang Xiaofan and Tian linger: &ldquo;this man is too high to fight the enemy. I&rsquo;ll hold him back, you two go quickly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After saying that, he reached out for a move, and inserted himself in the rock wall until now. The seven star sword, which was slightly vibrated, seemed to be summoned by him. It broke through the wall with a clank and flew back to him.</p>
<p>The ghost king looked at Xiao Zhou and nodded, still smiling, and said: &ldquo;with your Taoism, it seems that in the younger generation of disciples under the Qingyun sect, you should be the first. I can&rsquo;t believe that besides this Zhang Xiaofan, there are still talents like you in Qingyun gate. It&rsquo;s not bad, it&rsquo;s not bad! &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was startled, but found that elder martial sister Tian ling&rsquo;er and Xiao Zhou&rsquo;s eyes were all aimed at him. His face was a little hot for a while, but he didn&rsquo;t know what to say.</p>
<p>Xiao Zhou takes a deep breath and steps forward. The seven star sword in his hand lights up, but the ghost king doesn&rsquo;t move. He just stands there and looks at him with a smile. Xiao Zhou knows that this man is the most powerful enemy in his life, but there are younger martial brothers and younger martial sisters in the same family behind him. In any case, he can&rsquo;t abandon the war and run away. He only hopes that he can hold him back and let the two of them go first.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, he just wanted to use his fortune to control the sword. Suddenly, his heart and blood were surging and pouring up. He could not bear it any more. He burst out a mouthful of blood.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan and Tian linger were shocked and rushed to help him. Xiao Zhou was pale, and knew that he had been hit by the ghost king, which shocked his heart. When the meridians are damaged, they can no longer cast. In his heart, he was horrified. He knew that he was in a desperate situation, but the other half knew how high he was to the ghost king. It is just appalling that the damage to the right way in the future will be incalculable.</p>
<p>The ghost king looked at him and suddenly said, &ldquo;you are trying to fight, but you want to hold me back for a while and a half.</p>
<p>So that you two can escape together? &quot;</p>
<p>Xiao Zhou snorted, but didn&rsquo;t answer. Tian ling&rsquo;er stood up and stood in front of him. He said angrily, &ldquo;demon, don&rsquo;t think you are proud of your higher way. I&rsquo;m not afraid of you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was shocked. Just now, the ghost King hurt Xiao Zhou. No one can see that he is very good at Taoism. The three of them may not be his rivals. Seeing Tian linger&rsquo;s fearless appearance. In my heart, I was worried. I pulled her up and asked Tian linger not to be too impulsive.</p>
<p>Tian ling&rsquo;er hasn&rsquo;t responded yet, but this move has fallen into the eyes of the ghost king and Biyao. Biyao&rsquo;s face was gloomy. She snorted coldly. She looked at tianling&rsquo;er and Zhang Xiaofan again. Suddenly she said, &ldquo;Zhang Xiaofan, is this the elder martial sister tianling&rsquo;er you&rsquo;ve been talking about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian ling&rsquo;er and Xiao Zhou are surprised. Xiao Zhou frowns. &ldquo;Younger martial brother Zhang, do you know both their father and daughter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was silent for a long time and whispered, &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this time, Tian ling&rsquo;er suddenly called out. &ldquo;Ah! I recognize that you are the demon sect witch who secretly ran over that night. Later, we chased you to the island outside and said that you were looking for Xiaofan&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>Half of what she said, she suddenly shut up, just staring at Zhang Xiaofan.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was in a state of confusion. In fact, all the time, what he was most afraid of was the appearance of this scene. Now it did, but he still did not know how to deal with the past.</p>
<p>The ghost king stood there and saw Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s complexion, but he still smiled and said, &ldquo;brother Zhang, I left at the foot of kongsang mountain that day. How are you these days?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan is upset and doesn&rsquo;t pay attention to him. Xiao Zhou frowned and was really confused. Seeing that the ghost King&rsquo;s father and daughter were ambiguous about this younger martial brother Zhang, they were afraid of the unusual relationship. It&rsquo;s just that Qingyun sect has strict rules, and it&rsquo;s strictly forbidden to communicate with people in the devil kingdom. I just don&rsquo;t know what the relationship between this younger martial brother Zhang and the two of them is. Don&rsquo;t violate the rules. That&rsquo;s not good.</p>
<p>But now, after all, it&rsquo;s not the time for questioning. The three of them are still in the Jedi. Xiao Zhou reluctantly draws back his mind and turns to face the ghost king. Just as he is about to speak, the ghost king takes a look at him and suddenly says, &ldquo;you forced Zhenyuan to enter the seven star sword, but you want to hold me back with your residual force, so that you two can escape?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Zhou&rsquo;s body was shocked and his face was gray. Unexpectedly, the ghost King&rsquo;s mind was so meticulous. With his Taoism and precaution in advance, he and others were afraid of no luck.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the ghost King smiled and said, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t have to be disappointed. I didn&rsquo;t mean to embarrass you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Xiao Zhou and Tian ling&rsquo;er are doing strange things at the same time. Zhang Xiaofan looks surprised and looks at him.</p>
<p>The ghost king looked at Baguio, then turned his head to see Zhang Xiaofan, and smiled: &ldquo;brother Zhang, that day, under the dead soul abyss of kongsang mountain, you also saw the true feelings for Yao&rsquo;er in adversity, and lived together&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Only half of what he said, Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s face has changed, and he feels that Xiao Zhou and Tian linger have looked at each other with different eyes. In a hurry, he wants to say: &ldquo;you, you Hu&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this time, Zhang Xiaofan looked at Biyao&rsquo;s eyes, but there was some sadness in her eyes. All of a sudden, he thought of the scene that she was the only one to accompany him to suffer in the night of strong wind and heavy rain. It was inexplicable and soft in his heart, but he could not speak any more.</p>
<p>However, the ghost King&rsquo;s words are still going on: &ldquo;and that day you enlightened Yao&rsquo;er and dissolved our father and daughter&rsquo;s knot over the past ten years, which can be said to be kind to me.&rdquo; He smiled and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you today, and I&rsquo;ll let you three go. Only in this way, in the future, when you return to Qingyun, you will be blamed by those old people who don&rsquo;t know right from wrong. Why don&rsquo;t you join my holy religion? I will pay great attention to you. You can also live with Yao&rsquo;er for two nights, don&rsquo;t you&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo; But Zhang Xiaofan could not bear it any longer. He pointed to the ghost king and said in a loud voice, &ldquo;kill me! Even if I die, I will not join your demon sect! &quot;</p>
<p>Tian ling&rsquo;er was relieved and clapped his hands and said, &ldquo;well said Xiao Fan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, Xiao Zhou glanced at Zhang Xiaofan lightly, but his brow was still not loosened.</p>
<p>The ghost King smiled and shook his head, saying: &ldquo;well, that&rsquo;s up to you. It&rsquo;s going to be a long time. Take your time! &quot;</p>
<p>Finish saying, he a pull Baguio, do not stay again, two people fly to the outside of the cave.</p>
<p>Baguio is in the air.</p>
<p>Suddenly, I turned around and looked at Zhang Xiaofan. Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s eyes looked back at her. In his angry heart, he was at a loss again.</p>
<p>Xiao Zhou is on the side. Look at his face in the eyes, but frown more tightly.</p>
<p>The ghost King&rsquo;s father and daughter soon disappeared in the dark. A moment later, the noise outside suddenly became loud, as if someone in the right way had suddenly been attacked.</p>
<p>Soon after, there was a roar and a sharp wind. It seemed that many people took off into the sky.</p>
<p>Only listen to the strong voice of Taoist Cangsong. The voice moves all over the country and says: &ldquo;who is your honor. Why don&rsquo;t you dare to come down and compete with me for a second? &quot;</p>
<p>This is obviously said to the ghost king, but only listen to the roar of the wind, but no one answers. I think the ghost king and Baguio are far away.</p>
<p>In the cave, it&rsquo;s quiet now. Tian ling&rsquo;er looks pale at Xiao Zhou and says with concern: &ldquo;elder martial brother Zhou, don&rsquo;t worry about your health! Well, I don&rsquo;t know which master you are? &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan looks at Xiao Zhou&rsquo;s shaky appearance. Hurriedly ran over and held him. Xiao Zhou looks at him, Zhang Xiaofan feels uneasy and lowers his head.</p>
<p>Xiao Zhou sighs gently. He smiled and said to him, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t call me elder martial brother Zhou. This is my pseudonym mixed into the demon sect. I don&rsquo;t have the surname Zhou.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian ling&rsquo;er said &ldquo;ah&rdquo; and said: &ldquo;then you are&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Zhou smiled and his brow jumped. It seemed that there was a pain in some place, but then it was back to normal. With a smile, he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the disciple of Qingyun gate Tongtian peak. I&rsquo;m a disciple under the master daoxuan. My surname is Xiao and my name is Yicai.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, are you senior brother Xiao Yicai?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Zhou nodded with a smile.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan and Tian linger look at each other. For them, this name is really famous.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>The night is already deep, the night sky on Liubo mountain is twinkling with countless bright stars, twinkling, shining on the world.</p>
<p>In a secret place, the ghost King walked out slowly, only to see Biyao standing alone on a small hillside, staring at the direction of the east side of Liubo.</p>
<p>It is the place of the righteous.</p>
<p>The ghost King sighed softly, walked behind her and said softly, &ldquo;Yao&rsquo;er, you should be careful at night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biyao body moved a bit, silently turned around, forced a smile, said: &ldquo;yes, thank you dad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost king looked at her and said, &ldquo;are you thinking about Zhang Xiaofan</p>
<p>Biyao blushed, but did not speak.</p>
<p>The ghost King patted his daughter on the shoulder and walked forward two steps. He said: &ldquo;I see him today, and I find that since he went to the Fire Dragon Cave with you, it seems that Tao Xing has gone a step further.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biyao Zheng for a while, some happy face color, way: &ldquo;is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ghost King nods, way:&rdquo; under my conjecture, mostly is he read &ldquo;the book of heaven&rdquo; after the first volume, some comprehend When he said that, he turned his head and smiled and said, &ldquo;say, the general outline of the first volume of the book of heaven that you brought to me from the blood dripping hole. After I read it, it is very helpful for the cultivation of Taoism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that right?&rdquo; said Biyao</p>
<p>The ghost King nodded and said: &ldquo;yes, there are four volumes in the book of heaven, and there is a fifth volume in the legend, but no one has ever seen it. But since ancient times, four volumes have been handed down from our holy religion. Unfortunately, many of them have been lost. We, the ghost King clan, can have today&rsquo;s scenery. It&rsquo;s because the ancestor of the previous generation got the second volume of the book of heaven by chance 300 years ago. &quot;</p>
<p>Speaking of this, he paused and said: &ldquo;just in the second volume, although the Taoist method is profound and mysterious, the general outline and the key techniques are closely linked to the first volume. Therefore, in these hundreds of years, our ghost King clan can only share the world with the three major groups of Hehuan sect, changshengtang and wandumen. But in the future, haha&hellip;&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I would like to congratulate my father,&rdquo; said Biyao with a smile</p>
<p>The ghost King smiled and nodded, &ldquo;this time you really made great contributions. Originally, I sent you to kongsang mountain blood refining hall. In addition to your experience, I just wanted to find out if elder blackheart could leave any magic weapon. Unexpectedly, I brought back the Tianshu. It&rsquo;s ten times better than any magic weapon. &quot;</p>
<p>Biyao smiled, but suddenly her face was a little dim.</p>
<p>The ghost king looked at his daughter for a long time, and suddenly he laughed.</p>
<p>Biyao wakes up, blushes and says, &ldquo;Dad&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost King smiled and shook his head, saying, &ldquo;why do you worry so much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biyao bit her teeth and said, &ldquo;Dad, you didn&rsquo;t miss it today. Zhang Xiaofan and the dead guy look at his elder martial sister Tian ling&rsquo;er like that. I&rsquo;m only afraid of it&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ghost King way:&rdquo; what to be afraid of, afraid that he is infatuated with a piece, to you and ruthless</p>
<p>Baguio lowered her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ghost King light way:&rdquo; I but with you different view</p>
<p>Biyao was surprised. &ldquo;Dad, what do you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost king said: &ldquo;as I see today, Zhang Xiaofan is really good to his elder martial sister, but when you and Xiao Zhou fight to a critical moment, he can&rsquo;t control himself.</p>
<p>He cried out in silence and jumped out regardless of his own safety. Only by this, and in the past, you and him have lived and died together, and accompanied each other all the way. In his heart, he may not understand it, but your weight may not be much worse than that of his elder martial sister. &quot;</p>
<p>Biyao&rsquo;s face is red again. In the night, it is more charming, but then her eyes flow. But there is an ineffable color of joy.</p>
<p>The ghost king saw her look in his eyes, walked over to gently caress her hair, the color of love was clear, and said: &ldquo;however, you can&rsquo;t be happy too early. First of all, the difference between the door and the door is a barrier he can&rsquo;t cross. Secondly, his Shifu, martial uncle and uncle in Qingyun gate can&rsquo;t allow him to have any affection for you. So when I left today, I deliberately said that your relationship was ambiguous. I think it&rsquo;s Xiaozhou. In Qingyun gate, his position is not low. If he goes back to preach, Qingyun gate will doubted Zhang Xiaofan. In this way, he could join our church. A little more! &quot;</p>
<p>After that, he seemed to be very proud of what he had done and laughed twice.</p>
<p>Biyao began to smile, but soon after, she slowly put up her smile and lowered her head.</p>
<p>The ghost King frowned. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, Bagao said softly, &ldquo;I, I have some worries. In this way, I&rsquo;m afraid that Xiaofan will suffer again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost King snorted and said: &ldquo;if there is no sharpening, how can we know that the sword is sharp! If he can&rsquo;t bear the pain, don&rsquo;t say that I don&rsquo;t feel relieved to give you to him. Let him come to my door and I look down on him! &quot;</p>
<p>Biyao nodded slowly, but somehow, she was still worried. She could not help looking to the East, but she saw the vast forest under the sky, which cut off her sight, as if there were thousands of mountains and rivers.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai&rsquo;s sudden appearance really caused a stir in Qingyun gate. Taoist Cangsong and Tian were both surprised and happy. Moreover, from Xiao Yicai&rsquo;s words, they also learned that the devil cult seemed to be looking for Kui Niu, a strange beast that appeared on Liubo mountain, and unexpectedly knew that even the ghost king, one of the four masters of the devil cult, had come here.</p>
<p>At the moment, Xiao Yicai is lying on a temporary stone bed with his back against the stone wall because of his injury. Only Taoist Cangsong and Tian are around him. Other disciples have been temporarily removed.</p>
<p>Taoist Cangsong nodded slowly, with a dignified face, and said, &ldquo;it turns out that that man is the new generation of the ghost king of the ghost King sect of the demon sect. Indeed, he has a profound Taoism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian didn&rsquo;t easily frown and said, &ldquo;Yicai, how did you get into the demon sect?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai smiled and said: &ldquo;that day, I was ordered by my master to sneak into kongsang mountain to check the whereabouts of the demon sect. As expected, I found that there were the remaining evils of the blood refining Hall of the demon sect. However, through my observation in various ways, the remaining evils of the blood refining hall are not enemies, and they don&rsquo;t worry about it. They just listen to them for many times to talk about how the holy religion is. It seems that there are some secret and big moves among the demons. In order to find out, I changed my name to Xiao Zhou. It&rsquo;s just when they are using people. I have some skills. I joined the demon sect very smoothly. &quot;</p>
<p>Speaking of this, he apologized and said to Tian, &ldquo;but Uncle Tian, when younger martial brother Zhang and younger martial sister Lu Xueqi and younger martial sister Lu of xiaozhufeng fell into the abyss of death, I was just assigned to deal with elder martial brother Faxiang and others of Tianyin temple in another way. I&rsquo;m really sorry for not being able to rescue them. But fortunately, younger martial brother Zhang is very lucky and safe. I&rsquo;m relieved. &quot;</p>
<p>Tian is not easy to smile and says, &ldquo;no problem, it&rsquo;s no wonder you don&rsquo;t have to worry about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taoist Cangsong listened to it, and then he hummed.</p>
<p>It is not easy for Tian to listen to him, and he will not listen to him.</p>
<p>Taoist Cangsong turned to Xiao Yicai and said, &ldquo;but then, martial nephew Yicai, you are too adventurous. You should know that all the thieves of the demon sect are insidious and cunning. If you don&rsquo;t do well, what harm have you suffered, I can&rsquo;t explain it to the leader and elder martial brother. &quot;</p>
<p>Tian not easy also nodded and said, &ldquo;yes, before going down the mountain this time, the head elder martial brother didn&rsquo;t hear from you for several months, and he was very worried. He specially privately told us to pay attention to your whereabouts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai&rsquo;s face darkened, and he shook his head and said, &ldquo;Alas! It&rsquo;s all my fault that worries my mentor. &quot;</p>
<p>Taoist Cangsong smiled and said, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t have to think too much about it. This time, you have made great contributions. When we clean up the remaining evils of the demon sect here, the leader and senior brother will not blame you after returning to the mountain. I&rsquo;m afraid that you will be rewarded heavily.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai blushed and said, &ldquo;Uncle Cangsong, you are joking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian is not easy to say lightly: &ldquo;this is not a joke, you really have a lot of credit this time. But Yicai, you should not do such dangerous things in the future. Elder martial brother of the headmaster attaches great importance to you. After he became an immortal, most of the headmaster&rsquo;s position will be passed on to you. When you have a heavy responsibility, don&rsquo;t act recklessly. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Xiao. Thank you very much for the teachings of Uncle Cangsong and uncle Tian. &quot;</p>
<p>Taoist Cangsong nodded and said, &ldquo;OK then! I think you are tired too. Have a rest earlier! Fortunately, your injury today didn&rsquo;t hurt the basic meridians, otherwise it would be troublesome. &quot;</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai looks at Taoist Cangsong and Tian not easy to stand up, but also wants to stand up to see each other off. Tian was not easy to hold him down, shook his head and said, &ldquo;you have a wound on your body. Just have a good rest. We are not in Qingyun Mountain, so we can get rid of these common rites. &quot;</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai didn&rsquo;t disobey him. He was really tired, so he leaned back on the stone wall again and said, &ldquo;thank you, martial uncles. Then forgive me for not sending.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taoist Cangsong waved, and Tian couldn&rsquo;t walk out easily. He was about to walk to the cave entrance. Suddenly, Xiao Yicai called out behind: &ldquo;Uncle Tian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian is not easy Zheng for a while, turn round, way: &ldquo;how?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai leaned on the stone wall and said with a smile, &ldquo;you can almost forget my memory. Last year, when I visited martial uncle dazhufeng, martial uncle Su Ru said that he wanted a &ldquo;big shell pearl&rdquo; which is a special product of the southeast coast. Just this time when I came to the East China Sea, I found one. Do you want to watch now, martial uncle? &quot;</p>
<p>Tian is not easy to ponder for a moment. He looks at Xiao Yicai again, smiles and says, &ldquo;Hey, if you don&rsquo;t say it, I forgot it too. Fortunately, you have a heart. Otherwise, I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ll be bored to death by your uncle Su after I return to Dazhu peak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that, he walked back with a smile. Taoist Cangsong stopped a little in situ. Naturally, he would not inquire about the Pearl, so he went out.</p>
<p>In the cave, only Tian and Xiao Yicai are left.</p>
<p>Tian is not easy to smile and come over, but when he sits down in front of Xiao Yicai, the smile on his face is gone. He looks back slightly and says lightly: &ldquo;your uncle Su&rsquo;s temper has always been external and internal. As early as 100 years ago, she ran to the east coast and found the big shell pearl. There is no one at the moment. What&rsquo;s the matter? It&rsquo;s OK for you to say. &quot;</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai nodded, looked at Tian not easy, and said: &ldquo;martial uncle is really smart. I want to talk to you about your younger martial brother Zhang Xiaofan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian was not easy to frown. He was a little surprised and said, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s wrong with him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Yicai coughed and deliberately lowered his voice. It is not easy for Tian to understand immediately. He leans forward slightly and listens attentively.</p>
<p>Cave, a quiet, at this moment only a faint whisper, gently reverberate. (to be continued. )</p>
