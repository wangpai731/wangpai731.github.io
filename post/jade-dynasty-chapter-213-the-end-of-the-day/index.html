      <p>The roar seemed to come from a far away place, because in the roaring heat waves and flames, the terrible sound of dragon singing of the eight wild fire dragons seemed to be a little far away. What GUI Li and Lu Xueqi face directly is the huge flame from the raging waves, and the once hard ground under their feet, but now it completely collapses and turns into a lava hell, with huge cracks and countless cracks. The red magma rushes and roars under his feet, splashing like waves and tides, hitting on the remnant scorched black rock, constantly burning and sending out a silky sound.</p>
<p>Rolling flames, covering the sky and the earth, in a twinkling of an eye has been in front of.</p>
<p>In this breath of despair, it seems that I can&rsquo;t breathe.</p>
<p>In front of the huge waves, his eyes were wide open and he had a big drink. The magic wand left his palm and floated in the air in front of him. At the same time, GUI Li&rsquo;s hands formed a seal similar to Buddhist dharma seal, but from the palm, it was not the solemn and solemn golden glory of Tianyin temple Buddhism, but a little strange dark red light.</p>
<p>Under the urging of his magic power, the Soul Eater suddenly stands up and stands in the void. On the top of the blood sucking bead, with the seal in the ghost&rsquo;s hand, the golden mantra of Buddhism floats. In the space between the ghost&rsquo;s chest and the Soul Eater, there is a magic wand clinging to it. In the void, the air seems to twist slowly and condense into a Tai Chi pattern.</p>
<p>However, the twinkling of the Taiji pattern is not the pure light of the real Dharma of the Qingyun sect, but a mixture of various visions of the magic sect and the strange arts. Finally, it is the first time that some of the most powerful Dharma schools in the world have been put into practice at the same time.</p>
<p>Under the red flame light, Lu Xueqi stood behind the ghost in silence, staring at the man who went all out, and faced the front with him, that terrible dragon! The light blue light of Tianya radiates behind the ghost.</p>
<p>Her hair, fluttering in the billowing wind!</p>
<p>The next moment. The blazing fire came up.</p>
<p>In an instant, it seems that the whole world has become a fire, like being in a furnace and suffering from purgatory. Endless red flame roared in the ear, as if endless hands from all directions crazily pulling the body, to crush him!</p>
<p>Shaking all over!</p>
<p>However, there is still a little strange light in the sea of flames.</p>
<p>After being submerged, the tenacious, struggling in the sea of fire flashed out.</p>
<p>Eat the soul!</p>
<p>At the same time, the three colors of gold, blue and red radiate from the soul eating, condensing into an invisible wall, defending the master in this crazy sea of doomsday.</p>
<p>As if a miracle, this seems to be the destruction of all the eight wild fire dragon strike, was actually blocked by the ghost, even the monkey Xiao Hui still lying on the shoulder of the ghost. Also flashing three blood red fierce eyes, toward the fire dragon, roared.</p>
<p>It was just that Gui Li was obviously not good. Her face, which had been reflected by the fire, turned pale in an instant. Lu Xueqi, who was standing behind him, felt a slight tremble in his body for the first time, and quickly helped him. She was shocked when she reached out to touch him.</p>
<p>The whole body. Even Lu Xueqi and other people of practice have the pain of burning their palms, not to mention the ghost itself. More alarming. It was Lu Xueqi who held up GUI Li&rsquo;s hands, and immediately felt that although GUI Li still maintained the posture of forming Dharma seal defense, her hands and arms were shaking involuntarily.</p>
<p>The power of this blow is terrible!</p>
<p>The blow failed. The giant dragon&rsquo;s head swayed slightly in front of the eight wasteland fire dragon. It seemed that there was something unexpected. In the burning red flame like a mountain, the huge dragon head slowly lowered and did not launch an attack again immediately. Instead, it looked at the two tiny human beings.</p>
<p>Longan, is that unique red transparent flame!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zheng!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clear and crisp Fengming, blue light, Tianya from Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s hands to leap out, reflecting the figure, step on a step, block the body behind, deeply breathing, resolutely facing the existence of terror.</p>
<p>Black hair, still fluttering in the wind.</p>
<p>A few strands of hair, gently whisked in the heat wave, fell on the face of the ghost, even if it is in the end of the general purgatory, that once familiar with the faint fragrance, but still spread to the heart.</p>
<p>When you are in despair, is there anyone who can accompany you?</p>
<p>Even if there is no way to go, has anyone not given up?</p>
<p>The eyes in an instant as if through the time, forget the burning fire around, see the original youth, once the past.</p>
<p>Memories as like as two peas in the dark abyss, like the return of the innocent days.</p>
<p>Originally, this figure, really, has never changed?</p>
<p>Who is the changed person?</p>
<p>After the dragon head of the eight wild fire dragon, the rotating halo of the mysterious eight evil gods suddenly began to twinkle. All kinds of strange symbols loomed and flickered under the halo.</p>
<p>The dragon head of the eight wasteland fire dragon suddenly stopped. It was as powerful as it was. It seemed that it was also urged by something. It sent out a roar again.</p>
<p>The Dragon chant, like a mountain and a tsunami, rushes forward. In an instant, all the remaining rocks on the ground rapidly melt into magma in a violent tremor, but for a moment, the feet of GUI Li and Lu Xueqi are completely a sea of hot lava. With the roar of the eight barren fire dragons, the sea of magma began to flow in the same direction from the original disorderly surging.</p>
<p>The lava torrent is surging faster and faster, and the hot gas is steaming up, turning the once stone chamber into a real lava hell. Soon, too great power, in this magma sea pulled out a huge whirlpool, destroying all the red flame burning on the magma, such as a climax of Carnival dance.</p>
<p>The whirlpool became bigger and deeper, and the roar, which was pulled by the rushing torrent, slowly came out from the depth of the whirlpool, like thunder, and gradually became loud. Finally, it was deafening, and even overshadowed the sound of the eight barren fire dragons in the air.</p>
<p>When the rapidly rotating magma has rapidly rotated to the point of madness, the huge vortex is tens of meters wide, from the deep vortex, accompanied by the thunder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boom!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In an instant, the sky rocked and the earth moved. From the huge lava whirlpool, a column of blazing heat was directly cast out. It was completely composed of magma. It was as thick as ten people, with incomparable prestige. Compared with it, Lu Xueqi and GUI Li, who seem to be fragile and small to a disproportionate extent, rush to it.</p>
<p>Sweep all over the world!</p>
<p>As if this is the real power!</p>
<p>The power of fire, the essence of fire!</p>
<p>Before the lava column arrived, Lu Xueqi and GUI Li even felt their bodies empty. Just a moment ago, the last corner of the stone wall on which they were still leaning was turned into broken stones and scattered one after another under the stress of that crazy power, but what was shown behind them was not the more solid stone wall. Actually, it is also a broken rock that gradually cracks and reveals red lava and slowly melts.</p>
<p>Above them are the eight wild fire dragons, surrounded by a sea of wildly burning fire, and at their feet are lava pillars of fire that are irresistible!</p>
<p>In the light of the fire, in the gasp, what is shivering?</p>
<p>What is it? Let&rsquo;s hold hands, refuse to let go, connect tightly!</p>
<p>The sword, like the singing of the distant horizon. With the faint blue light, from 10 years ago, 100 years ago, thousands of years ago, to this day, for the love of people, forward stab.</p>
<p>Wind and fire!</p>
<p>She is like a fairy throwing fire, the white figure blooming in the light of the fire, is so bright and extraordinary beauty, forget all the world, only the edge of the hand, that never forget the gentle and solid. Be with you.</p>
<p>What is there to be afraid of? What to be afraid of?</p>
<p>That sword!</p>
<p>Her figure, forward, flying in the wind. It has a unique style.</p>
<p>Behind her, there is a low singing, once a commonplace firestick, but now the soul swallowing, from the back, twinkles with blue light. Catch up with Tianya and fly with the blue blade at the same time.</p>
<p>That figure, on the side, in this desperate fire, tightly dependent.</p>
<p>Tianya sword trembled slightly. The brilliance on the blade pierced through countless heat waves, as if in response to the general, and the soul eaters with it also sent out a strange scream, and the blue light was flourishing!</p>
<p>Blue and blue, in the surrounding sea of fire, from the sky down, not only did not have the slightest escape, but toward the towering lava flame column, which is not the same as the head stab!</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s to be afraid of?</p>
<p>What can I fear?</p>
<p>In the middle of the sky, the fire dragon suddenly roared, the Dragon chanted and roared, and the dragon spread out. All around the flame, the moment with the rise, as if also in the wild dance, watching this last carnival.</p>
<p>The two figures that seem to be integrated, melting in the entangled blue brilliance, like a meteor resolutely down, collided with the lava plume.</p>
<p>It is what kind of brilliant, such as the huge red flame flowers burst into bloom, all the lava sea instantly boiling splash, high into the air. The huge pillar of fire seemed to be raging wildly in this seemingly narrow place, burning everything that could be burned, but the brilliant brilliance was directly directed into the pillar of fire.</p>
<p>A moment later, but it seems that after a long time, time solidification, who knows?</p>
<p>The rising lava falls slowly, the rapidly rotating magma slowly slows down, and the huge whirlpool begins to shrink. Only the terrible pillar of fire seems to stay above the sea of lava for a moment.</p>
<p>A blue and blue light suddenly pierced a hole on the side of the fire column and shot out. After a moment, it seemed that with a low muffled sound, &ldquo;aggressive&rdquo; sound, countless small openings were constantly emerging, and the blue and blue light was constantly spraying out happily. A moment later, with a roar, the huge pillar of lava collapsed, turned into hot magma again, and fell into the sea of lava below.</p>
<p>In the middle of the sky, ghost and Lu Xueqi reappear.</p>
<p>Their clothes are full of scorched and burnt marks, and even some parts of their skin have the appearance of injury. Their faces were indescribably tired, and their fierce chest and mouth were red with bright blood.</p>
<p>However, although they are weak and know it is hopeless, the magic weapon in hand, Tianya and soul swallowing, radiate the brilliance that can&rsquo;t be seen directly and never before.</p>
<p>Their hands, still holding together.</p>
<p>Their bodies, slowly rising.</p>
<p>Slowly ascended into the air, again, standing in front of the huge dragon head of the eight wasteland fire dragon.</p>
<p>Two tiny people, facing each other, stood in silence.</p>
<p>The burning eyes of Bahuang fire dragon gaze at this pair of men and women. From the mysterious flame, you can&rsquo;t see the inner thoughts of the fire dragon, or. Strong as it is the general existence, where will care about human feelings.</p>
<p>The halo of the mysterious eight evil gods seems to be dimmed a lot at the moment. I don&rsquo;t know why. Behind the dragon&rsquo;s head, it seems that even the eight evil gods are struggling.</p>
<p>Perhaps, to master the more powerful power, the price paid. It should be more!</p>
<p>How many people understand this truth from the ancient witch clan to now?</p>
<p>The light is flickering, and there are mysterious symbols on the eight evil gods, slowly turning. The eight barren fire dragon did not attack immediately. It seems that for it, it is also waiting for something.</p>
<p>The fierce body, from the pain of strong self endurance, finally began to tremble uncontrollably, the bloodstain on the chest. It&rsquo;s getting bigger and bigger.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi silently stretched out her hand, put her arms around his waist, pulled him over for a few minutes, and leaned against her.</p>
<p>The familiar wheezing, gently echoed in her ears, slightly warm, echoed on the edge of her pale face.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s itchy!</p>
<p>She thought that all of a sudden.</p>
<p>Then, gently turn your head and look at him.</p>
<p>What I saw was the ghost looking at her eyes.</p>
<p>She nodded slowly. A little smile.</p>
<p>GUI Li gazed at her for a long time, the corner of the mouth, finally also revealed that trace, with a light blood. smile.</p>
<p>This time, in addition to the eight ferocious gods, the flame in the circle of eight fierce gods became bright for the first time. Gradually over the surrounding gods.</p>
<p>The whole rotating aperture, for the first time, left behind the dragon&rsquo;s head and sank slowly. With the movement of the diaphragm, the flaming flame descended on the top of the eight wild fire dragon and slowly merged into it.</p>
<p>The eight wasteland fire dragon of the colossal thing suddenly gave out a roar. In a moment, the whole sea of fire seemed to tremble slightly. What could make such a powerful creature feel pain?</p>
<p>The flame slowly, but it is unstoppable into the head of the eight wild fire dragon.</p>
<p>Then, the eight evil gods with mysterious symbols on the eight sides seemed to lose their luster and quickly fade down again.</p>
<p>Bahuang fire dragon stopped roaring and slightly lowered its head. After a moment, the huge dragon head slowly rose again. The desperate breath of destruction reappeared, covering GUI Li and Lu Xueqi.</p>
<p>This time, I do not know why, but not the first two attacks on that horrible sight. On the contrary, the surrounding temperature has dropped a lot. The sea of lava at the foot is still hot, but the flow of magma has also slowed down. Suddenly, the essence of the fire has been rapidly refined away in the molten lava hell.</p>
<p>The eight barren fire dragon finally gazed at the two figures again. This time, what burned in its eyes was no longer the mysterious red and transparent flame, but a pair of eyes full of complex and crazy human emotions.</p>
<p>The dragon head rises and opens its mouth.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s as if it&rsquo;s breathing deeply!</p>
<p>With that action, all the flames burning in the air seem to have lost their light, but the oppressive force enveloped in Gui Li and Lu Xueqi makes people want to give up in despair.</p>
<p>From the huge mouth of the eight wasteland fire dragon, suddenly, a flash of light, not a blazing fire, but a real pure flame.</p>
<p>There is no impurity, no noise. The most terrible and purest thing in the world is pure fire, which can burn all things in heaven and earth!</p>
<p>Slowly spray out!</p>
<p>There is no trace of heat leakage, just a thin and round pillar of fire, pure as jade, flying towards GUI Li and Lu Xueqi.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi in the hands of Tianya, slowly down, Tianya next to the soul, also slowly back to the ghost hands. Blue, blue light, slowly fade.</p>
<p>There is no human power that can withstand the irresistible pure fire.</p>
<p>The flame, bit by bit approaching!</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi looks up in silence, but she no longer looks there. In her eyes, there is only one shadow, only that one face.</p>
<p>She looked deeply, and there was a faint smile on her mouth. She seemed not to let go of it. It seemed that she wanted to engrave it in her heart and soul. She could never forget it after thousands of years.</p>
<p>The flame is approaching!</p>
<p>The fierce sleeve robe, suddenly without any omen, turned into gray powder in an instant, scattered, and then the clothes of his whole arm.</p>
<p>And this hand. How much time does this body have?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it! He thought faintly, did he die like this?</p>
<p>However, the wish can not be finished</p>
<p>He gave a low, bitter smile. It was the soft and gentle palm that I held tightly.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the flame flashing light, like a meteor burst out, there is a little fire. It suddenly flashed through his mind, and the moment was a mess.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi immediately felt the ferocious uneasiness, subconsciously took his hand, and almost at the same time, the pure fire, has arrived at their side, and is about to swallow their bodies.</p>
<p>Death?</p>
<p>Or raw!</p>
<p>At that moment, the ghost suddenly yelled and pulled Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s body behind him. Lu Xueqi screamed, but there was no intention to escape alone. Instead, she tightened her fierce hand.</p>
<p>And between the lights and fire, between the hands of the devil, suddenly there is a brand that looks like jade but not jade, surrounded by a circle of jade, and the ancient flame pattern in the middle is just a mirror of XuanHuo!</p>
<p>The next moment, pure fire, fire in xuanhuojian.</p>
<p>Eight evil gods in the distance.</p>
<p>Suddenly a tremor, and the huge and powerful eight wild fire dragon, the terrible dragon head suddenly also for one smothers, all things. All of a sudden they all stopped.</p>
<p>Then, it seems that there is a voice from the nether world, gentle and gentle singing, long reverberating, as if thousands of years ago, that gentle and exquisite woman.</p>
<p>The dark fire became bright. The clumsy flame pattern in the middle is like a rebirth at the moment. Under the burning of pure fire, inject infinite vitality, greedily absorb the essence of the world&rsquo;s most pure fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly, ghost Li issued a light call, that xuanhuojian was already blazing, and he could no longer hold it. The XuanHuo Jian, which left his palm, did not go down. Instead, it slowly rose into the air and flashed slowly under the gaze of the eight wild fire dragons.</p>
<p>The blazing breath slowly emanates from the xuanhuojian, with a little dreamy white smoke. It seems that the surrounding air is vaporized. Around the XuanHuo Jian, a huge mysterious force is slowly tearing up the surrounding space. In the white illusory smoke, a beautiful female figure is slowly formed.</p>
<p>It was a woman as like as two peas in a traditional dress. She had a stick in her hand, and her face was exactly the same as the exquisite witch figure outside the mouth of the town of magic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Linglong&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>As if it was a cry of heartrending despair, the eight barren fire dragon once again showed a look of pain. Then, the flame slowly emerged from the top of the dragon&rsquo;s head, and then the fire light dissipated, revealing the animal God&rsquo;s real body. At the moment, the beast God&rsquo;s body was withered, as if it had been the oil exhausted and the lamp was withered.</p>
<p>However, such a pair of eager eyes, thousands of years have never changed, he forgot all the world, only the eyes of the woman in the smoke.</p>
<p>He toward that illusion, fly away, eyes with incomparable satisfaction.</p>
<p>Xuanhuojian was spinning silently, and the exquisite illusion seemed to be smiling, opening his arms and embracing him.</p>
<p>As soon as they saw it, they would embrace each other. But behind the beast God, there was an earth shaking roar. The forbidden eight wasteland fire dragon lost its control. At the first sight, they recognized the enemy. The body it had destroyed made it attack instinctively.</p>
<p>Deep breath, long breath, distant ghost and Lu Xueqi at the same time, but the beast God seems to have forgotten everything around him, or even if he knows, how can he care?</p>
<p>He pounced on it. In the smoke, it was not an illusion. He actually hugged the body.</p>
<p>Exquisite</p>
<p>Exquisite</p>
<p>He called in a low voice, closing his eyes contentedly like a child. Linglong smiles and caresses his hair with her hand.</p>
<p>The Dragon roared, and the flames of anger came in an instant and swallowed up everything!</p>
<p>The two figures, in the sea of fire, slowly disappeared, but, there was no trace of sadness, but slowly emerged, is that strange happiness.</p>
<p>In the light of the fire, xuanhuojian suddenly flashed down from mid air and was landing at the hand of GUI Li. In the vibration, the ghost suddenly reached out to catch it. At the same time, the powerful eight wasteland fire dragon suddenly seemed to lose the support of some strength, and the huge gap began to slowly shrink.</p>
<p>The eight barren fire dragon roared again, full of reluctance, but with its power, it was unable to stop its huge head being swallowed up by the mysterious space again. But, in the last moment, it filled with the hatred of destroying everything, towards this space, spewed out the last terrible fire.</p>
<p>giant earthquakes and landslides!</p>
<p>In a flash, all the lava boiled and exploded together, the stone wall completely melted, and the huge space collapsed like sand. At the same time, countless crazy magma torrents rushed out in all directions.</p>
<p>GUI Li and Lu Xueqi looked at the scene of the end of the day, but they could no longer escape. But at this moment, a pure and gentle aura suddenly appeared on the XuanHuo Jian, which enveloped them in a light shield and quickly rose up.</p>
<p>And under them everything turned into flames.</p>
<p>The whole vast land of 100000 mountains, countless mountains, as if in that moment, heard that crazy roar. The scorched black mountain, which has been standing for tens of thousands of years, gradually collapses in the raging magma surge, while the hot magma rising from the sky penetrates into the sky.</p>
<p>At the foot of the fire like doomsday world, at the entrance of the ancient cave of Zhenmo, heimu was at a loss. However, the fierce black tiger laughed wildly and cried out: &ldquo;here, here, this day has come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you crazy?&rdquo; he exclaimed</p>
<p>The black tiger laughed wildly, but suddenly, they were shocked at the same time. Then, in front of them, the exquisite stone statue of the witch who had been guarding the ancient cave of the town for thousands of years, was suddenly broken and scattered into countless pieces. Then, it was swallowed up by the incoming heat wave and disappeared.</p>
<p>The black tiger looked up to the sky and roared like a maniac, &ldquo;Niang, Niang, wait for me, I will come&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the foot of the black tiger, the panting sound of black wood hiding behind the black cloth was strong and fierce. Suddenly, he said in a loud voice: &ldquo;no, no, I can&rsquo;t do this. I have something to do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, Blackwood suddenly turned around and flashed out like a fly, leaving the place that was about to be destroyed.</p>
<p>However, black tiger did not care about the departure of black wood. His huge body was so guarding the entrance of the ancient cave, and he looked up to the sky and laughed wildly.</p>
<p>Soon, countless collapsed debris and crazy lava torrent, swallowed up his figure.</p>
<p>The earth seems to be shaking, countless beasts and birds panic, that a towering mountain, in the roar, in the dark dust that blocks the sky, collapsed!</p>
<p>The sky, slowly began to rain.</p>
<p>Fire rain!</p>
<p>Among the 100000 mountains, it has been down for three days and three nights.</p>
<p>Thousands of years later, who can still remember the past? (to be continued. )</p>
