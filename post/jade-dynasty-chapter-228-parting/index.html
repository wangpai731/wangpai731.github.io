      <p>&ldquo;Ah&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was like the voice squeezed out from the deep throat. It was hoarse and dull. Tian didn&rsquo;t cry softly. His body began to tremble slightly, but he soon calmed down. Only his face, which used to be a faint, faint black air, now full-bodied as if to cover his whole face.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s palm is suddenly full of cold sweat.</p>
<p>In that moment, she finally untied her mind has been haunting a puzzle, a puzzle about why tianbuyi suddenly looked a little fat.</p>
<p>The original Honda&rsquo;s slightly tight robe, which is not easy to get fat by accident, is now relaxed. Obviously, Tian Buyi is not fat. His body is just as he used to say. The reason why he looks fat is that his clothes are tight. At the moment, the back of his robe cracked and relaxed, and brought the truth to Lu Xueqi and the ghost.</p>
<p>A simple hilt of a sword was revealed from the fluctuating clothes and robes in the air. It was there quietly, quietly, and inserted on the back of the field.</p>
<p>His whole body slowly began to tremble. Even his lips lost their blood color and trembled slightly. His expression seemed to want to shout something, but when it came to his mouth, there was no sound.</p>
<p>The earth shaking situation just now is frozen. GUI Li and Lu Xueqi look at the field blankly, as if forgetting that there is a terrible enemy behind him, daoxuan immortal. However, immortal XuanZhen didn&rsquo;t start to attack them. He just had a smile on his mouth.</p>
<p>A cold smile.</p>
<p>And pointed to the palm of a knife, five slender fingers suddenly curved, out of thin air in the fingertip rotation, floating, finally gradually dispersed. The movement echoed in general. The field in the distance gave out a dull hum, and his body was shocked. If the whole person was shocked, his head suddenly lifted to the sky. With a breath of despair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pa!&rdquo; A low noise. Under the gaze of GUI Li and Lu Xueqi, Tian Buyi&rsquo;s chest is pierced by a broken sword without a sword tip, which looks like a stone, and reveals a small part of the sword body.</p>
<p>Strangely enough. Field is not easy not to bleed, a drop of blood did not flow out.</p>
<p>legend of chusen!</p>
<p>This unique and unique ancient sword has penetrated Tian Buyi&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p>The black gas on Tian Bu Yi&rsquo;s face seems to have a strong life again. Now he is fully alive and crawls wildly. Swallow up the face of Tian not easy. But the field is not easy&rsquo;s head, slowly hangs down, hangs in front of the body chest. Then, his body seemed to lose all its strength. First, the flame, which never left his body, completely lost its light, left his palm and fell from the air. Then, that once countless times in the memory of the short fat body, shaking a few times, finally can not support. It fell from mid air.</p>
<p>It is like, a burning meteorite, to its final destination - the earth.</p>
<p>His whole body was shaking. Once he thought he was strong enough to face all the bad luck in the world. But at this moment, he seemed to be back ten years ago. The breath of despair, like a ferocious monster, swallowed him up again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He let out a hysterical scream and ran after him recklessly. Toward the falling body, toward the familiar body. His castration was so fast that lightning and thunder could not be stopped, and he flashed by with a strong wind. In the field is not easy to fall to the ground before the moment, he caught the body of the master who raised him to grow up.</p>
<p>Tentacles - cold, lifeless!</p>
<p>This is clearly a corpse that has been dead for many days, and has no body temperature. It&rsquo;s not easy to hold the field tightly. The breath in my mouth is getting heavier and heavier. I don&rsquo;t know when. Tears were streaming down his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be careful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly, an anxious exclamation came from behind, and Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s white figure flew quickly. In the middle of the sky, daoxuan real man&rsquo;s hand drew a big circle, and the deep and mysterious mantra stopped instantly.</p>
<p>A trace of vigilance passed instinctively, but he held Tian Bu Yi&rsquo;s hand, and the grief and surging emotion in his mind actually suppressed his reason.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t let go.</p>
<p>This body, this person, raised him from a young age, passed on his achievements and taught him how to be a man. For decades, he has been looking at this man&rsquo;s back to live, walk and move forward The sound and appearance, every fixed frame memory picture, as if a sound of thunder beat in his mind, so that he can not move.</p>
<p>How can he let go?</p>
<p>The ancient sword of Zhuxian was lit up, and the light stabbed his eyes in an instant, making people unable to see everything in front of him. The familiar despair of many years ago shrouded him.</p>
<p>Between the electric light and flint, Lu Xueqi tried her best to get there. She threw herself on her whole body and caught the ghost. With a huge momentum, she fell to one side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boom</p>
<p>If the electric light shoots in all directions, it dissipates in an instant. The dazzling aura was introverted in an instant, and the ancient sword of Zhuxian pierced tianbuyi&rsquo;s chest mercilessly and flew into the air until he was next to immortal daoxuan. A strong, slender hand reached over and held the handle of the sword. In an instant, the sky was so dark that even the few stars in the distant sky finally disappeared into the dark clouds.</p>
<p>No blood, not a drop!</p>
<p>GUI Li seems to have lost his soul and all his feelings at the same time. He climbed up numbly and struggled to climb towards the field. Lu Xueqi reached out to help him, but her hand reached half way, but she was frozen.</p>
<p>She suddenly threw herself on the ghost and held him. Her breath was very fast, like the fear from my heart</p>
<p>&ldquo;You Look at Uncle Tian&rsquo;s hands&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boom!&rdquo; In the sky, a thunderbolt rolled past, and the rain began to fall in the thick dark clouds in the sky.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that the rain is black.</p>
<p>With the thunder roaring and gradually increasing rain, lightning appeared in the sky like a dragon, cutting through the dark sky. In the soil, on Tian&rsquo;s body, his palm, one of his fingers, moved.</p>
<p>He was stunned, and the sad look on his face was replaced by a burst of uncontrollable ecstasy! He cried out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rushed out, toward the field is not easy, recklessly rushed past.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s face was pale, but her eyes were more rational than ghost. She was shocked and quickly reached out to pull the ghost. But he didn&rsquo;t hold on to it. He just grabbed a piece of his robe and tore it down with a hiss.</p>
<p>In the middle of the sky, the Taoist immortal standing in the cloud is surrounded by black air. All the rain and wind avoided him. He looks ferocious, looks like a demon, arrogantly looks at the mortals under his feet, as if he has mastered their fate.</p>
<p>The ancient sword of killing immortals in his hand is like stone instead of stone. Once again, a strange light flashed on the simple sword like jade, reflecting on his face, adding a bit of bitterness!</p>
<p>As if he saw a ray of life in despair, he rushed up in ecstasy, but he didn&rsquo;t find it at all. On Tian Buyi&rsquo;s face at the moment, the black gas did not disappear with his vitality, but became more intense. At this time, Tian Buyi&rsquo;s face was completely covered.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just coming up.</p>
<p>When he opened his arms to pick up the master and called, Tian Bu Yi&rsquo;s palm suddenly turned up and poured his supreme magic power into his heart like a huge hammer.</p>
<p>The expression on the ghostly face solidified instantly.</p>
<p>A moment later, his body flew back out, and the sound of &ldquo;crackling&rdquo; continued to ring along the way. Tian is not easy to be a Taoist. If you look at the whole world, you can conceit the power of this palm. At that time, I don&rsquo;t know how many sternum has been interrupted, and I&rsquo;m afraid all the viscera have been moved. It&rsquo;s been hit hard. It was also because he had learned the real Dharma of &ldquo;the book of heaven&rdquo;, and the great Brahma Prajna of Tianyin Temple protected himself automatically, so he didn&rsquo;t die on the spot. Rao is so, he also flew three Zhang away on the spot. In an instant, the eyes were dark, Venus flashed, and the chest pain was even more numb.</p>
<p>But there was only one voice in his mind for a moment: what&rsquo;s wrong with master? What&rsquo;s wrong with master?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha ha ha ha&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The shrill laughter came down from the air, and daoxuan was standing in the cloud. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want to die with me, don&rsquo;t you want to kill the people? How about this ancient sword of killing immortals? Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi&rsquo;s body, slowly stood up, although the action looked a little hesitant, but every action, are full of strange power. The black air on his face was surging wildly, giving people a thrilling feeling every time.</p>
<p>Tian Buyi&rsquo;s right hand slowly stretched out, and suddenly his five fingers opened. The red flame fairy sword that fell in the distance suddenly lit up. After a moment, it flew back to his hand automatically. And the field is not easy to hold tight the red flame, then stride his some slow footstep, impressively toward the ghost that is seriously injured in the ground.</p>
<p>Black rain, the more it falls, the more sick it gets!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jingle!&rdquo; Like a dragon chant, Tianya comes out of his sheath, Lu Xueqi looks pale, and the horizontal sword stands in front of the ghost. Her chest heaved rapidly, the rain hit her skin, white clothes covered with dust, but added a bit sad.</p>
<p>The rain hit the ground and turned the soil into mud. The corners of his mouth exuded blood, and instantly dyed his front clothes red. Even his voice became hoarse and intermittent: &ldquo;master You What&rsquo;s the matter with you? &quot;</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi seemed to be unable to hear any sound, and the storm had no effect on him at all. His body just walked slowly towards Lu Xueqi, who was struggling on the ground and was pale and clenching his teeth.</p>
<p>Every step is with the intention of killing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boom</p>
<p>A blast of thunder, head and ring, even if the sky standing in the clouds of Taoist immortal, unexpectedly also one shock. A moment later, there was a strange change in his face.</p>
<p>It seems to be a confused look, as if deep sleep in a big dream, will wake up between, seems to think of something, but always can not grasp, can not remember, for a moment at a loss.</p>
<p>It seems that it is opposite to the abnormal expression of immortal daoxuan. The strange light flashing on the ancient sword of killing immortals held by him has been fading down at the same time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boom!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thunder, like a great hammer, shakes the sky and the earth, as if the gods of heaven were angry with it.</p>
<p>Between the electric light and flint, Tian Bu Yi&rsquo;s steps suddenly stopped, and the thick black air that enveloped his face seemed to suddenly lose the support of some strength and subsided a little, revealing his eyes.</p>
<p>In a moment, how long?</p>
<p>Buddhism said mustard Xumi, the moment of eternity, this is general, but the rest of the time, what kind of a moment?</p>
<p>The eyes, a deep look at the ghost, watching him struggling in the mud, spit blood, shouting the word master.</p>
<p>The light of the red flame burns like a flame!</p>
<p>In his eyes.</p>
<p>That moment. How long can it be?</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi suddenly shakes his head and seems to have exhausted all his strength. He finds Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s place and looks deeply.</p>
<p>Lightning and thunder!</p>
<p>The wind and rain are howling!</p>
<p>Tianya magic sword is blooming with light blue light. Standing in the wind and rain.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s sight, at that moment, is not easy to touch with the field!</p>
<p>Like thunder, like lightning, like the wind. Like the huge waves, she clearly saw that the turbulent things like huge waves were staring at her in her eyes, which seemed to have endless meaning, and finally turned into silence!</p>
<p>The next moment, Lu Xueqi no longer a trace of blood, even her lips, become almost transparent.</p>
<p>The thunder passed by, and daoxuan&rsquo;s body trembled slightly. The color of confusion dissipated, and almost at the same time, the strange brilliance of Zhuxian ancient sword came back to light.</p>
<p>On the earth, the wind and rain are still howling. Tian Bu Yi&rsquo;s eyes, once again, have been covered by the black air of mediocrity.</p>
<p>His steps, heavy step in the mud, splashed dirty water scattered, step by step, toward the original goal.</p>
<p>Murderous!</p>
<p>Moribund!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Field.</p>
<p>Uncle Tian&hellip; &quot; Lu Xueqi didn&rsquo;t know why, and her voice became very difficult. With a trace of sadness, she said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t come here. Please don&rsquo;t come here&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>Ghost Li propped up his arm and looked up. As soon as he raised half of his body, he fell into the mud again. The mud splashed all over his face, but he didn&rsquo;t seem to feel it at all.</p>
<p>He just looked up. Looking at the master who came back from the dead, he walked towards them step by step.</p>
<p>Red flame burning, I do not know who is burning the soul of blood.</p>
<p>In the wind and rain, the field is not easy to approach. Lu Xueqi holds Tianya&rsquo;s hand and trembles slightly. Her face seems to be white and transparent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle Tian Stop, stop</p>
<p>Answer her, is the red flame fairy sword.</p>
<p>The hot flame was chopped down, and the rain within three feet in an instant evaporated. Tian is not easy to be controlled by the mysterious magic, and he seems to be advancing instead of retreating.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi reluctantly raised the Tianya block, with a sharp sound of &ldquo;Zheng&rdquo;. She even took her sword and was hit by a huge force and floated out. She fell like a broken kite from the ghostly body and fell behind Tian Buyi.</p>
<p>There is no barrier between master and apprentice.</p>
<p>Field not easy to stop the pace, red flame slowly raised. Although ghost Li lies on the ground powerless, but a pair of eyes are still wide open, staring at the field is not easy. But Tian Bu Yi&rsquo;s face is full of black air, and he can&rsquo;t see his expression clearly.</p>
<p>The wind and rain are bleak, and the world is desolate.</p>
<p>Huoran, the field is not easy to a roar, red flame instant brilliance, when the head toward the ghost split down. GUI Li didn&rsquo;t avoid, in fact, he couldn&rsquo;t escape. His mouth was slightly open. He didn&rsquo;t know if he was shouting something, but the sound was all drowned in the hot wind brought by the red flame.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boom Above the sky, thunder again!</p>
<p>The world was pierced by a flash of lightning, which lit up the dark world.</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi&rsquo;s action suddenly froze, and the red flame stopped just one foot above the ghost&rsquo;s head. Ghouli can even clearly feel that the hot flame is about to burn itself out.</p>
<p>But no!</p>
<p>Field is not easy to all movements are stopped, red flame of light, also quietly, a little bit hidden. On Tian Bu Yi&rsquo;s body, from his heart, the tip of a sword can be seen.</p>
<p>The Tianya sword, which twinkles with light blue brilliance, once again penetrates Tian Bu Yi&rsquo;s body and heart.</p>
<p>The wind and rain were like a knife, beating on the figure behind Tian Bu Yi. Her messy hair was close to the skin, and countless drops of water slid down her face. Her face was as gray as death, and her whole body was shaking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boom!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a flash, there were three thunder blasts in the sky, all of which exploded on the side of the real man daoxuan. His body was shocked. Suddenly, his whole body was curled up and his face was extremely painful. A moment later, he screamed wildly up in the sky. He turned into a black light, and galloped away like electricity.</p>
<p>On the earth, GUI Li was stunned again. He was staring at his master&rsquo;s chest, the point of his sword which came out of his chest.</p>
<p>No blood, not a drop of blood!</p>
<p>&ldquo;When!&rdquo; The flame completely lost its light and fell to the ground like scrap iron. The muscles of the corners of his eyes twitched, and his body trembled slightly.</p>
<p>Then, Tian not easy double knee a soft, slowly knelt down in the mud, in front of the ghost. The black air on his face is rapidly dispersing, but there is still a light layer over it, lingering.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi holds Tianya&rsquo;s hand and starts to shake slightly, but she doesn&rsquo;t hesitate, just closes her eyes. A moment later, the light blue glow and auspicious Qi on the Tianya magic sword rose. With its own Millennium auspicious and healthy qi, it gradually emitted from Tian Buyi&rsquo;s body. While dispersing the black gas, it also enlarged the wound on Tian Buyi&rsquo;s chest by more than ten times.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Er ah&hellip;&rdquo; There was a hoarse cry in his throat, like a desperate beast, with tears streaming down his face. The strength burst out from nowhere. He was so badly hurt that he flew up like a fish and jumped on Tian Bu Yi&rsquo;s body and dragged him away from Tianya, who just dispelled the last trace of weird black gas.</p>
<p>Tian Bu Yi&rsquo;s familiar face appeared in the wind and rain again.</p>
<p>His eyes are open, I don&rsquo;t know if they have not been closed.</p>
<p>Then, the corner of his mouth moved for a moment, to the ghost, smile.</p>
<p>Standing behind him, Lu Xueqi seemed to have exhausted all her strength in her body. Her feet were soft and she fell into the mud on the ground.</p>
<p>GUI Li only took a look at Tian Bu Yi&rsquo;s chest, and he knew in his heart that the teacher who raised himself to adulthood had come to the end of his life and could no longer be saved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, why&hellip;&rdquo; He hissed and could not tell whether it was rain or tears on his face.</p>
<p>This time, he was facing Lu Xueqi, his body struggling in the mud on the ground, trying to climb over to question her.</p>
<p>But a pair of trembling hands stopped him. The hand was weak and fragile, but he immediately pulled it back. &ldquo;Master, master&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Buyi looked at him, and his spirit was like wandering. He tried to condense the last strength of this remnant body. He struggled to say to the ghost: &ldquo;no No wonder She, no wonder She</p>
<p>Ghost Li stretched out his hand and tightly held the hand of Tian Bu Yi. What came from the palm of the hand was only cold.</p>
<p>He couldn&rsquo;t bear it any longer. He cried loudly. On this stormy night, he could only utter the only two words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master Master&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>Tian is not easy to gaze at him, the corner of his mouth slightly moved, the voice gradually became low: &ldquo;old seven&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master, I am, I am.&rdquo; Ghost Li desperately close to the field is not easy, tears drop by drop in the field is not easy on the palm.</p>
