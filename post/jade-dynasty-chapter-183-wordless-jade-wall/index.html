      <p>The long bell, once again echoed in Xumi mountain, announced the beginning of a new day.</p>
<p>Rising sun, from the eastern horizon out of a small halo, the first ray of sunlight sprinkled on the world. In the early morning, there are many people walking along the steps of the mountain road to the magnificent temple. Most of them are holding incense candles and offering sacrifices. They are full of piety.</p>
<p>Some of them also brought their children to worship with them. The children were naive, but they didn&rsquo;t feel tired on the mountain road. Many young people jumped and ran back and forth, looking cheerful.</p>
<p>Morning fog will not disperse, lingering outside the Tianyin temple, the air feels a bit moist. The early monks had done the necessary morning lessons for the day, and were now cleaning the courtyard, gently sweeping aside the leaves that had fallen last night.</p>
<p>In the whole Tianyin temple, it seems solemn and quiet at the moment, bathed in the light mountain wind, with the wind blowing, there are if there are no leaves fragrance.</p>
<p>The sound of the bell, guiding the people at the foot of the mountain, also circled in the temple, awakened the sleeping people.</p>
<p>He wakes up slowly from his sleep.</p>
<p>How long, did not have such a peaceful sleep, peaceful wake up, is in the sleep, he is also very peaceful, not even sleep, just deep sleep, quiet deep sleep.</p>
<p>It turns out that this is such a happy feeling.</p>
<p>He listened to the melodious bell in silence, as if the place where the sound floated was not in the vast world outside the house, but in his heart. Even he had a feeling that the bell was ringing for him alone.</p>
<p>Until the bell died down, he got up slowly, opened the door, went out, looked up, expanded his chest, and breathed deeply.</p>
<p>The moist breath of the mountain poured into his heart, and his face slowly showed a rare expression of satisfaction. I really want to stand on it. Just now, a voice came from the courtyard door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Benefactor Zhang, are you up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li turned his head and saw FA Xiangmian smiling. Standing at the door not far away from him, he nodded and said, &ldquo;good morning!&rdquo;</p>
<p>FA Xiang looked at him and said with a smile, &ldquo;benefactor, after this period of rest, he has recovered from his injuries. It&rsquo;s just that when people say that they are recovering from a serious illness, they have to pay attention to it. The terrain of Xumi mountain is quite high. Sooner or later, it&rsquo;s no better than the earthly boundary. It&rsquo;s very cold. Please be careful. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you for your concern. I&rsquo;ve written it down.</p>
<p>In addition, I don&rsquo;t know if Abbot Pu Hong is free today. I hope to see the master and interrupt for a moment. &quot;</p>
<p>FA Xiang said with a smile, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s good. I was ordered by my teacher to invite benefactor Zhang to have a breakfast and then to meet him. &quot;</p>
<p>He was stunned for a moment and said, &ldquo;why, master abbot, is there anything I can do for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>FA Xiang said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, but I think I have to ask the benefactor how you are injured.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he said, &ldquo;in that case, I&rsquo;ll go and see the abbot later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Dharma coincides with the ten ways: &ldquo;don&rsquo;t worry, benefactor. Just now the abbot has specially told you not to rush the benefactor. The old master is still in the small Tianyin temple on the top of the mountain. If you have time later. Just go ahead and go. &quot;</p>
<p>With a faint smile, the Dharma minister said: &ldquo;in Tianyin temple, if the benefactor wishes, all the donors can go there. I&rsquo;m not afraid of it. &quot;</p>
<p>GUI Li moved in his heart and looked at FA Xiang. The words of FA Xiang were vague and profound. It seemed that he had regarded him as his own person in Tianyin temple, perhaps in the hearts of the monks of Tianyin temple. After all, he was a member of Tianyin temple after all?</p>
<p>FA Xiang turned around and retreated. The ghost looked at his back, remained silent for a moment, and then walked back to his meditation room.</p>
<p>At the moment when he stepped on the top of the mountain, GUI Li still couldn&rsquo;t help but stop himself slightly. For him, it was a place where he had mixed feelings.</p>
<p>In the morning sun, the small Tianyin temple is simple and unadorned in front of it. With low walls and small courtyards, where is the soul stirring trace of that night?</p>
<p>Looking back and looking at it, there are faint voices coming from Tianyin temple in the distance, with flourishing incense and a lively scene. Perhaps, are these peaceful people happier?</p>
<p>He turned around in silence and walked into the little Tianyin temple. Soon, the unique silence here enveloped him. In the huge courtyard, it seemed that only his footsteps were echoing.</p>
<p>When I got to the door of the meditation room, I stopped and looked at the back of the yard subconsciously. The path there was blocked by the wall, but I could still see the direction extending backward. Just at this time, there was only a blank in the last yard!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, people come naked and go blank.</p>
<p>He knocked on the door of the meditation room. Soon, the peaceful voice of master Pu Hong came out of the room: &ldquo;is it benefactor Zhang, please come in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ghost Li light should a, push the door to walk in. In the room at the moment, only master Pu Hong sits on the Zen bed with a smile on his face and looks at the ghostly coming in.</p>
<p>GUI Li nodded to master Pu Hong and said, &ldquo;master, I heard that elder martial brother FA Xiang said that you have something to look for me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong asked, &ldquo;yes, but I heard that you have something to discuss with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>After pondering for a moment, he nodded his head and said, &ldquo;yes, it&rsquo;s not a big deal. I&rsquo;ve been here for a long time. I&rsquo;m almost in good condition now. I dare not continue to bother you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong said with a smile, &ldquo;little benefactor, what&rsquo;s this saying?&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li shook his head and said, &ldquo;at the foot of Qingyun Mountain, the master has saved my life. Since then, the master has helped me to untie my heart knot. I am really grateful. However, I am a member of the demon sect after all. If I go on like this, I will hurt the reputation of your temple. &quot;</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong said, &ldquo;little benefactor, I don&rsquo;t know what to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master, please tell me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong nodded and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to say so. Seeing the little benefactor&rsquo;s face, I can&rsquo;t tell that he is not a vicious person. His body is just the result of his fate. It&rsquo;s not the fault of the little benefactor. What&rsquo;s more, the little benefactor has such a long-standing relationship with younger martial brother Puzhi, that is, he is related to our Buddha, and even more to Tianyin temple. As long as you are willing to come back, Tianyin temple should try its best to protect it. Let alone Qingyun gate, it is the right path of the world. My temple is not afraid at all. Buddha said that it is the supreme merit to ferry people once, and the little benefactor is a person who is predestined. Why not put down the worldly package and get this pure and comfortable life</p>
<p>After that, he had a good look. Looking at the ghost.</p>
<p>GUI Li did not expect that master Pu Hong would say such a thing. He was stunned for a moment. In these days, his mood in Tianyin temple is quite different from that in the past. He is very peaceful and comfortable. It is like this very much, but he is such a man, but after all, there are still things that can&rsquo;t be put down.</p>
<p>He was silent for a long time. Then he slowly raised his head and made a deep salute to master Pu Hong, saying, &ldquo;I know that the master is sincere to me and intends to enlighten me. However, I am a worldly man, and I rise and fall with the wave. In that worldly world, there are countless concerns, but they can&rsquo;t give up. Master, I can&rsquo;t accept your kindness.</p>
<p>&quot;</p>
<p>After that, he sighed and wanted to turn around and walk away. However, master Pu Hong said, &ldquo;take your time, benefactor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master, what else can I do for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a trace of reflection on Pu Hong&rsquo;s face, and he said slowly, &ldquo;the benefactor&rsquo;s heart is like a rock, and I dare not force it. However, if the benefactor is willing, we have a request. I hope you can fulfill it. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter. Master abbot, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. &quot;</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong looked at him and said, &ldquo;although Puzhi&rsquo;s younger brother ended up like this in those years, he committed his own sin and was unforgivable. However, the root cause of his death is that&rdquo; blood sucking beads &ldquo;can not escape. Now Puzhi&rsquo;s younger brother has passed away. But the evil object is still on the benefactor, and it infringes on the little benefactor. &quot;</p>
<p>After a moment&rsquo;s silence, he said, &ldquo;what the master means is&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong said, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t have to be careful. I don&rsquo;t mean anything else. However, this blood sucking bead contains fierce and fierce anger, which is harmful to others and to oneself. After Puzhi&rsquo;s younger brother passed away in those years, I&rsquo;ve been distressed for more than ten years. I&rsquo;ve never missed this place. I&rsquo;ve been pitied by heaven. I&rsquo;ve come up with a way to restrain the evil spirit of blood sucking beads. Would you like to have a try, benefactor? &quot;</p>
<p>Although the power of blood sucking beads is infinite, the evil spirit is actually in these ten years. I don&rsquo;t know how much pain he has suffered, even his temperament seems to be gradually changed by it. Sometimes he had thought of Puzhi&rsquo;s original scene, thinking of the situation in which he was also controlled by this anger, and could not help but sweat. It is only natural that this matter should not be humanized to the outside world. Although he was worried, he did not have a good way to deal with it. Unexpectedly, he suddenly heard master Pu Hong say something like this, which hit him most worried at the moment.</p>
<p>After thinking for a long time, he slowly said, &ldquo;master Abbot has such a good prescription. I don&rsquo;t know how to deal with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong&rsquo;s face was solemn and said, &ldquo;this method is actually simple. To put it bluntly, it&rsquo;s just to use our Buddha&rsquo;s power and boundless compassion to degrade all the evil in this world. There is a &ldquo;wordless jade wall&rdquo; on the back mountain of Tianyin temple. It is said that the founder of Tianyin Temple understood the Buddhist principles under the jade wall without words, thus creating the whole line of Tianyin temple.</p>
<p>&quot;</p>
<p>The ghost frowned and didn&rsquo;t understand what it had to do with the blood sucking blood bead. Master Pu Hong then said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the boundary, which is the most solemn and auspicious place among the mountains of Xumi mountain. As long as the little benefactor sits there for a while, I will lead a group of monks to form a&rdquo; Vajra ring &ldquo;array around the jade wall. This auspicious spirit may erode the little benefactor It is not known that the blood sucking beads in the body have been suppressed. &quot;</p>
<p>He was shocked, but he did not expect that master Pu Hong&rsquo;s eyes were so unique that he did not know when he could see the disorder of Qi in his body. He thought for a moment and then said, &ldquo;master, I know what you mean. So I sat for a few days under the jade wall without words. But after that, I&rsquo;ll say goodbye and go. &quot;</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong nodded his head and said with a smile, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t worry, benefactor. I don&rsquo;t dare to stop you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He nodded, turned and walked out. Master Pu Hong watched his back disappear, sighed and said to himself, &ldquo;younger martial brother, you have a spirit in heaven. You should protect this child&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>What Wuzi Yubi said in the population of Puhong was that it was in the back mountain of Xumi mountain. GUI Li thought that it should be very easy to find. Unexpectedly, he was well prepared on that day. He followed the Dharma prime minister and the Dharma Shanshi brothers, who came to lead the way, and went back to the mountain. They even walked for half an hour without a trace.</p>
<p>GUI Li was a little surprised, but he didn&rsquo;t say it. Instead, FA Xiang wanted to be careful and considerate. Seeing that Gui Li&rsquo;s face was surprised, he thought with a smile: &ldquo;benefactor Zhang, why is this wordless jade wall so far?&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li was asked by him, but he didn&rsquo;t hide it. He said, &ldquo;dare to ask elder martial brother. Where is the wordless jade wall and how did it come from? &quot;</p>
<p>As he walked along, he said with a smile: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a long story. When the wordless jade wall appeared, no one knows, only a thousand years ago. When the founder of Tianyin temple was a wandering monk, he wandered around. One day, he mistakenly entered the high mountains of Xumi mountain and lost his way. I can&rsquo;t go out any more. However, the founder wandered between the mountains and forests. He was also born with Buddhism. He saw a smooth stone wall as smooth as jade. At that time, the founder was tired and tired, so he took a rest under the jade wall. &quot;</p>
<p>FA Xiang stopped for a moment and asked, &ldquo;Oh, what happened later?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is a fork in the path in front of FA Xiang.</p>
<p>Dharma Xiangxiang led to the left, but he walked toward a downhill road with a fierce spirit. At the same time, he said in his mouth: &ldquo;it is said that the founder sat under the wordless jade wall for three days and three nights. Somehow, he gradually settled down from his initial impatience. He was calm and determined, and entered into the great perfection of Buddhism. Three days later, he suddenly realized the Buddha under the wordless jade wall Reason. In addition, it is said that&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>FA Xiang turned his head and gave a mysterious smile. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s even more legendary that under the wordless jade wall, the founder realized the supreme Dharma Prajna handed down from generation to generation in Tianyin temple, and thus established the position of Tianyin temple in the cultivation of Taoism in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was in a daze. Shaking his head, I feel that the legend of the founder of Tianyin temple is really funny. There are many untruths in it, and there is a sense of absurdity. Originally, he had some expectations for master Pu Hong&rsquo;s casting this time, but now he listened to Dharma Xiang and said it like a story. On the contrary, it made him a little frustrated and sighed to himself.</p>
<p>FA Xiang was careful and looked at the change of the expression on the GUI Li&rsquo;s face. He just smile and lead the way, but he didn&rsquo;t speak. As for the monk who was tall and big behind them, he was always silent and did not speak.</p>
<p>They walked along the mountain road for half an hour, zigzagging along the high mountains. Unconsciously, they had left Tianyin Temple far behind, and they could no longer see it.</p>
<p>GUI Li didn&rsquo;t expect that the terrain of the mountain behind Tianyin temple was much larger than expected. However, there were emerald mountains and mountains, and the wind came slowly. Along the way, some strange rocks and strange things, or some cliff and waterfall fell from the sky and roared like a jade belt.</p>
<p>Along the way, I only felt open-minded for a moment, and I didn&rsquo;t feel bored to see the beautiful scenery around me.</p>
<p>Suddenly, he heard the Dharma saying in front of him: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s in front of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li was surprised and looked forward, but he saw that there was still a winding mountain road ahead. On one side of the road was thick woods, on the other side were weeds and thorns. Three feet away, there was a cliff. Where was the wordless jade wall that they said was more than seven feet high?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is the jade wall, elder martial brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>FA Xiang smiles and walks forward a few steps. He comes to the cliff and says, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li walked up to him and stood on the cliff. Looking up, he saw the fog under the cliff. It was like a valley like a rolling wave.</p>
<p>In the distance, we can see the indistinct mountain shadow, but they are all in a very far away place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it in the valley?&rdquo;</p>
<p>FA Xiang said with a smile, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s under your feet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was stunned and said with a smile, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go down!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that, FA Xiang jumped down, and FA Shan followed.</p>
<p>GUI Li stood on the cliff, pondered for a moment, and jumped down.</p>
<p>Soul devouring in the fog, flashing a dark light, slowly shrouded in the ghost, holding him, slowly falling.</p>
<p>The fog here seems strange. It seems that the fog is not thick. It is just entangled like a thread. Even if the mountain wind blows, it doesn&rsquo;t look like half scattered. In the process of falling down, he looked at the wall of the mountain, but saw a piece of white fog in front of him, which he could not see.</p>
<p>He was surprised, so he urged him to draw closer to the wall of the mountain. He saw the mist spread like clouds and slid out in front of his eyes. At the moment of his concentration, suddenly, he saw a figure appear in front of him.</p>
<p>No trivial matter, but as like as two peas in the face of a sudden shock, he stopped to look at it. He was surprised to see that he was standing in front of him, looking at himself with amazement.</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s eyes were deep, his face was full of vicissitudes, and he also held a soul eating magic wand. Just as the ghost was shocked, a Sanskrit song came from the sky. The heavy reverberation of the bell was like a big drum.</p>
<p>With this chant, a solemn force suddenly rises from the unknown boundary under your feet, like a torrent running through the sky. And the surrounding fog swept over, swallowed up the figure and disappeared. However, I felt a pain in my heart. The cold Qi in my body didn&rsquo;t urge me to do it automatically. It seemed that the Buddha Qi was extremely repelled and resisted by itself.</p>
<p>Under the fright. He also felt that in addition to the Demon power from the blood sucking beads, he seemed to be influenced by the Buddhism here, and the great Brahma Prajna, who was practicing himself, was not willing to stand down and jumped up, but he wanted to fight with the Demon power of blood sucking beads.</p>
<p>Before the beginning, there is such a huge change in their own body. The earth Qi of the earth boundary here is really incredible. GUI Li was shocked. He forgot the strange figure he saw in the fog for a moment. He just urged his own cultivation. Protect the heart pulse, slowly fall down.</p>
<p>Soon, the fog gradually thinned, and the scenery under my feet suddenly became clear. It was a small stone platform, quite smooth, surrounded by three Zhang square meters, with sparse trees. There were dozens of Tianyin Temple monks sitting around. It seems that these monks sit far or near, and there is no regular order. But it seems that there is a secret principle in it, and the light Buddhist power flows among them, which is actually a faint formation.</p>
<p>GUI Li looked at it carefully and suddenly felt familiar. After thinking about it carefully, I remembered that it was an ancient and clumsy font and the appearance of Buddhist Scripture.</p>
<p>GUI Li soon fell to the ground. When he looked around, he saw that both FA Xiang and FA Shan were sitting among the monks and quietly United. She lowered her eyebrows and lowered her eyes. She did not look at him again. At the head of the monks, it was the abbot of Tianyin temple, master Pu Hong. The one who sat on his left and had a head, was a Pufang God monk who made great achievements on Qingyun Mountain on that day.</p>
<p>It was a monk sitting at the head of the right side of master Puhong. He looked strange and fierce. He had never seen him before. But he looked haggard and sallow. He looked like a dying man. His old appearance was far better than that of master Puhong. I don&rsquo;t know who this is, but he can be on the same level with Puhong and Pufang. Obviously, he is also a great figure in Tianyin temple.</p>
<p>GUI Li didn&rsquo;t say much. He bowed his head and saluted master Puhong. Master Puhong returned the salute and said with a smile, &ldquo;the little benefactor is coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I don&rsquo;t know what the abbot is going to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong pointed to the platform and said, &ldquo;nothing else. You just need to sit on the stone platform and rest for a few days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li nodded his head and looked back at the stone platform. Then he looked up and looked around. There was a thick fog on the top of his head, but where was there the legendary wordless jade wall? Can&rsquo;t help but ask: &ldquo;master abbot, where is the wordless jade wall?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong said with a smile, &ldquo;you will see it in a moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was stunned and nodded. He turned around and was about to sit on the stone platform. Suddenly, there was a sharp roar in the sky. It was the wind, the howl of the beast, coming through the clouds and through the fog. Then there was a dazzling brilliance. It was actually a crack in the thick fog that shot down and was shining on GUI Li.</p>
<p>He took a step backward and looked up. There was a roar between the valleys, like thunder. The sea of fog suddenly raised waves, which changed from a gentle surge to a huge wave. The waves fluctuated, and then more and more cracks appeared. The thick fog became thinner and thinner, showing the brilliance one after another.</p>
<p>In the face of this strange image of heaven and earth, I watched for a long time. The fog finally drifted away and the brilliance was sprinkled. In an instant, the sky and the earth were shining brilliantly, which made everyone unable to see. After a while, it gradually eased down.</p>
<p>When GUI Li opened his eyes again, his body was shocked and saw the legendary jade wall without words.</p>
<p>Just in front of him, after looking at the small stone platform, under the cliff, there was a cliff like a mirror, which was hanging straight down, more than seven feet high and more than four feet wide. The material of the mountain wall was like jade rather than jade. It was extremely smooth, reflecting the beautiful scenery of heaven and earth. The mountains were all in this jade wall. Under the cliff, the ghosts and the monks of Tianyin temple are as insignificant as ants.</p>
<p>Compared with the nature of heaven and earth, man is so small!</p>
<p>After a long time of silence, Fang took a breath and did not say a word. He went to the upper part of the platform and sat down. He did not look at the people around him. He took a deep breath. Then he closed his eyes and sat still.</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong looked at the ghost for a long time, then turned to look at the monks behind him. Nodded.</p>
<p>Dozens of Tianyin Temple monks, including master Puhong, Pufang God monk and the mysterious old monk beside him, as well as FA Xiang, FA Shan and others, joined together to praise the Buddha.</p>
<p>Dozens of light golden light. Slowly, the voice of Sanskrit singing seems to come from the sky!</p>
<p>All of a sudden, the golden light was flourishing, and all the monks were sitting in the strange array. The golden light of the monks became more and more intense and dazzling. After a moment, however, the sound of roaring was heard. A great golden Buddha&rsquo;s words appeared on the array and rose slowly.</p>
<p>The chanting became louder and louder, and the world was solemn. I saw the Golden Buddha&rsquo;s words rising higher and higher, slowly reaching the middle of the sky. It stands up. In the sky under the sun, more can not be forced to look.</p>
<p>It seems to be inspired by the Buddha&rsquo;s true words. On that cliff, the originally smooth jade wall slowly shows the reflection of the Buddha character, but it is not like the ordinary mirror. Instead, it grows from a small point to a golden light, and slowly shows the shape of the Buddha character. However, when the image of the jade wall without words becomes larger, the Buddhist Scripture in the air seems to be a little dim.</p>
<p>cracking. The real words of Buddha in the wordless jade wall are so large that they almost surpass the real Buddha characters in the air. At this moment, the whole jade wall without words is shining with golden light, shining with Sanskrit. Suddenly. On the jade wall, there was a ray of light golden Buddha light, which was slowly shot out and shrouded in the sitting ghost.</p>
<p>His body moved for a moment, and his face showed a little pain, but he did not open his eyes, but endured. cracking. The pain faded from his face and Ann sat still.</p>
<p>There was no change in the light of the Buddha&rsquo;s light from the jade wall without words. The golden light flickered slowly, with an unspeakable solemn meaning.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the monks of Tianyin temple also have the same face, chanting the Buddha in a low voice, and the light above their Dharma array generally flows slowly, supporting the Buddhist mantra in the sky.</p>
<p>Time flow, so quietly passed</p>
<p>Three days later, the Buddhist Scripture on the wordless jade wall still had no tendency to weaken, and the faint light of Buddha reflected from it was still shrouded in the ghost.</p>
<p>His face was calm. It seemed that the three days had not changed for him at all. It was the same as he had just arrived here three days ago. However, there were below the people in Puhong around. Although the Dharma array held by the monks of Tianyin temple had not changed, the faces of all the people were faint and tired.</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong slowly opened his eyes from the fixed state and looked at the still calm and peaceful ghost. After a long time, he sighed in a low voice: &ldquo;chi&rsquo;er, chi&rsquo;er, can&rsquo;t you let go after all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he shook his head and sighed.</p>
<p>The Pufang God monk sitting at the bottom of his left side said: &ldquo;we worked so hard to set up a Buddhist array to subdue demons. First, we wanted to degrade the blood sucking blood beads for him. More importantly, we wanted to dissolve his inner demons.</p>
<p>But his heart is locked, and it&rsquo;s hard for him to get rid of the evil spirit. Even if the blood sucking bead dissolves, how can he know that he will not become a devil in the future? What we have done today is just to help the tyrant to do it! &quot;</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong frowned and his face sank. He said, &ldquo;younger martial brother, this young man has a deep relationship with Tianyin temple. We can&rsquo;t give up easily. Why do you say that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The general aspect changed his color and joined the ten ways: &ldquo;what you taught me, elder martial brother. I&rsquo;m not prejudiced against this young man. I really think of that time At that time, our elder martial brother was so sad that he didn&rsquo;t want to see him go astray again. I&rsquo;m sorry to hear from you. &quot;</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong&rsquo;s face softened down and said, &ldquo;why don&rsquo;t I share your mind with you, or I won&rsquo;t set up this great array of subduing demons, and intend to transform it to him with the power of Buddhist dharma. But just under this wordless jade wall, he seems to be&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>All of a sudden, there was a loud noise in the quiet and solemn Valley, and the whole wordless jade wall trembled a little. At the same time, the Buddhist scriptures in the sky and in the wordless jade wall were all crumbling.</p>
<p>Master Puhong and other monks in Tianyin temple were shocked. For a moment, they were shocked and urged to hold the Dharma. Unexpectedly, a painful color suddenly appeared on his face. The soul devouring spirit, which had been suppressed by Buddhism for the past three days, suddenly lit up, and a black air filled his face.</p>
<p>Master Pu Hong didn&rsquo;t expect that the blood sucking demon was so tenacious. After three days and three nights of subduing, he still had enough strength to resist. He was about to call the people to support the array again. However, he could not bear it any longer. He let out a long cry and rose into the air.</p>
<p>In the middle of the sky, the words of the Buddha&rsquo;s character suddenly scattered, and the ghosts and Li roared up to the sky in the sky, looking like madness. At the same time, looking back at the wordless jade wall, I saw that there were many dark red and bright red lights in the jade wall without words, fighting endlessly.</p>
<p>At that moment, when the light flashed and the visions appeared, there was a sudden thunder in the sky, and the sky darkened.</p>
<p>From the top to the bottom, a row of big characters appeared. In addition, there were countless ancient and difficult to understand gold fonts, which flickered between the golden and red light of the jade wall. But that row of big characters is clear and clear, which is &ndash;</p>
<p>Heaven and earth are not benevolent, with all things as cud dogs! (to be continued. )</p>
