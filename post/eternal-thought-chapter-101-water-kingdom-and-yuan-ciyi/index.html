      <p>There was a cold hum from the palm seat of sunset peak and a wave of his right sleeve. All the disciples of sunset peak were trembling all over the place. They felt as if the mountains were at the top of the mountain, and they were crying in their hearts.</p>
<p>In particular, the two brothers of beihanlie were under such pressure, their faces were miserable, their accomplishments in their bodies were shaking, and their hearts were more cruel to Bai Xiaochun, but they did not dare to show any.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t go back to the north bank, everyone will be closed for ten years and can&rsquo;t go out!&rdquo; Although the palm seat of sunset peak made a move, these people were after all his disciples of sunset peak. He seemed strict, but actually he also had protection. At the moment, his big sleeve swung, and a gust of wind swept through his words, which directly rolled up hundreds of sunset peak disciples here and threw them far away.</p>
<p>This just looked at Bai Xiaochun again, forced out a smile on her face and opened her mouth word by word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Xiaochun, can you remember now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun knew that he couldn&rsquo;t go too far. He knew how to behave. He knew that the result was the best at the moment. He coughed and was very proud in his heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha ha, you don&rsquo;t have to be like this, elder martial brother. I&rsquo;m a glorious disciple and a leader&rsquo;s younger brother. Although these young nephews are mischievous, how can I have a common understanding with them? They are just a group of naughty children.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun put on a look that everyone was the same generation. He had a bitter smile at the bottom of his heart, and Zheng Yuandong on the other side coughed. He did not know how many times he regretted his decision.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun pretended not to see it. She patted her chest and pressed down her pride. She was about to say the rest of the pill.</p>
<p>But at this time, Li Qinghou coughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As far as pharmacists are concerned, every original elixir is extremely precious. If the north bank wants the elixir, I don&rsquo;t know what to exchange for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun blinked, stood aside and did not speak. He looked at the four palms on the north bank eagerly.</p>
<p>The four palm seats on the north bank looked at each other, and the old woman on the kite peak took out a bead from her sleeve with her right hand.</p>
<p>The beads are blue. It seems that there is a mass of air flowing in it, and even there are waves of magnetic force around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This yuan magnetic bead, taken from the heart core of a yuan magnetic giant, has a trace of Yuan magnetic force. It can affect the operation of magic weapons within a certain range. It is also an excellent treasure for the foundation building friars. It may be difficult to perform it by condensing Qi cultivation. However, in Tianjiao Pavilion, there is a pair of spirit magnetic wings, which can be used as a killer mace for condensing Qi. The speed is so fast that it may be the foundation building If a monk wants to catch up with him, he will have a headache! &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bai Xiaochun, you won the first place in Tianjiao battle. Once Tianjiao pavilion was qualified to choose a treasure. I have brought you lingciji. With this bead, you can exchange Dan Fang!&rdquo; When the old woman opened her mouth, she waved her right hand, and a pair of blue wings appeared in her hand. Together with the bead, she flew to Bai Xiaochun and floated in front of her.</p>
<p>As soon as Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s eyes lit up, his speed was not so good, but if the foundation building friar really wanted to pursue him, it was not enough. But now, looking at the yuan magnetic bead jade spirit and magnetic wing in front of him, he immediately felt the extreme speed that the two magic weapons could produce after they cooperated with each other. This kind of thing could protect his life, and he was immediately moved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s more, if you have enough chance, you may feel the power of yuanci and realize the citation and denouncing methods in the top ten secret arts of Lingxi sect!&rdquo; Old woman skin smile meat not smile light mouth.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun licked her lips and was about to promise, but she held back and looked at Li Qinghou and waited for Li Qinghou&rsquo;s decision. Bai Xiaochun had already regarded Li Qinghou as a relative. He would listen to Li Qinghou&rsquo;s advice on such a matter. Even if Li Qinghou asked him to offer an elixir, it was no big deal for Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a pill. For the north bank, it&rsquo;s sacred. But for him, there are still many strange pills in his storage bag that don&rsquo;t know the effect. Now he has made up his mind to try them one by one. Maybe there are many wonderful functions in these strange pills.</p>
<p>Li Qinghou glanced at the four palm seats on the north bank. Finally, his eyes fell on the old woman. His eyes flashed and he suddenly opened his mouth.</p>
<p>Plus the top ten secrets of China Water country</p>
<p>As soon as Li Qinghou&rsquo;s words came out, the headmaster Zheng Yuandong&rsquo;s eyelids jumped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No way!&rdquo; On hearing Li Qinghou&rsquo;s big mouth, the palm seat of sunset peak said angrily. Not only did he not agree with this, but also the old man of palm seat at the top of the dome on the north bank also glared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lee Hei Tzu, don&rsquo;t go too far. Shuize kingdom is our inheritance secret method on the north bank. It is the first secret skill in Lingxi sect&rsquo;s top ten secret methods. It can&rsquo;t be given to you in the south bank!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun was watching the excitement below when he heard that the palm seat of the dome peak actually called Li Qinghou Li sunspot. He was stunned for a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joke, a thousand years ago, ghost night travel was still the inheritance secret law of ziding mountain. It was not the same as you who traded it on the north bank. How can we ask for your inheritance secret law in the south bank today? It&rsquo;s no good!&rdquo; Li Qinghou swung his sleeve and began to sneer.</p>
<p>A few palm seats on the north bank were speechless.</p>
<p>The palm seat of guiya peak is a vague figure with vague appearance. At the moment, you sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Although it&rsquo;s hard for us to make a ghost of Beiyi mountain for thousands of years ago, it&rsquo;s just that it&rsquo;s hard for us to refine the ghost&rsquo;s palm for thousands of years, but it&rsquo;s just that it&rsquo;s hard for us to refine the ghost&rsquo;s palm for the past thousand years, but it&rsquo;s just that it&rsquo;s hard for us to refine the ghost&rsquo;s palm for the past thousand years, but it&rsquo;s just that it&rsquo;s hard for us to refine the ghost&rsquo;s palm for the past thousand years</p>
<p>&ldquo;If there is no kingdom of water, there will be no change of danfang.&rdquo; Li Qinghou was determined.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun was at the bottom of his heart. He was surprised to see these people arguing about the shuize country. In fact, he felt that the conditions before had been very good. At the moment, he was puzzled. He paid attention to the shuize country. At the same time, he had a new understanding of Li Qinghou. In the dark, Li Zhangzuo should not be so serious in ordinary days. He could be a model of our generation. Is it because of this Is it called Li sunspot?</p>
<p>Thinking of this, when Bai Xiaochun looked at Li Qinghou, he had already worshipped him.</p>
<p>The four palms on the north bank pondered and communicated with each other. After a while, they still chose to agree. After all, although it is important to inherit the secret method, what is in front of us now is the precious pill.</p>
<p>Soon, under the sign of Li Qinghou, Bai Xiaochun quickly said the Dan Fang of the oestrus pill completely. This Dan prescription is special. There are several palm seats here, which have been sealed all around, so that only a few of them can hear Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s prescription.</p>
<p>After getting the danfang, the four palms on the north bank studied each other for a moment. After nodding one after another, a blue jade slip flew out of the old woman&rsquo;s hand of iris peak and went straight to Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The kingdom of water and water is the first of the ten secret methods. This magic power needs to observe all kinds of animals to form the spirit of their own life. It is created out of nothing. It comes into the world with water and forms a kingdom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For thousands of years of Lingxi sect, in addition to the Tianyi ancestor who had gathered a heavenly winged beast in all directions, after that, although there were still some people with amazing qualifications, the spirits that could be formed were all ordinary things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kind of original spirit can emerge in this method depends on the cultivator&rsquo;s mind and understanding of the spirit beast. If a hundred people practice shuize Kingdom, there will be a hundred different kinds of spirits, strong or weak. The Tianyi ancestor appeared the powerful Tianyi beast, but some people only appeared a rabbit and some snakes and insects.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bai Xiaochun, although you are a disciple of the south bank, our Lingxi sect seems to be competing between the north and the south, but in the end it is a family. I hope you can finally cultivate yourself and turn into your own soul.&rdquo; The old woman looked at Bai Xiaochun and said slowly. Although she opened her mouth like this, neither she nor the other three palms thought that Bai Xiaochun could make great achievements in the cultivation of this watery country.</p>
<p>Because this country of water and water needs to observe countless animals, which is not available in the south bank.</p>
<p>After the transaction was completed, the four palm seats on the north bank left with Zheng Yuandong. Li Qinghou stayed. When he looked at Bai Xiaochun, there was kindness in his eyes, but he seemed very strict.</p>
<p>He reprimanded Bai Xiaochun and told him not to be proud of being the first in the battle of Tianjiao. He also pointed out some incomprehensible points in Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s cultivation. Finally, he gave detailed guidance on some special uses of the bracelet and Yuan magnetic beads.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yuancizhu and lingciyi are very useful to you. You should be familiar with it. There is also the shuize country, which is more mysterious than the grass, trees and soldiers in Xiangyun mountain, and the dragon image turns into the sea Sutra. This skill was created by the first ancestor of Lingxi sect, which made our sect kill from the end of Tongtian River to the downstream. You should go and observe it more. When I teach you that there are all kinds of soldiers in the future, the effect will be better by this promotion Good. &quot; Li Qinghou told him again, and then he left.</p>
<p>Moved by Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s heart, Bai Xiaochun bowed to Li Qinghou and asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle Li, that Why do they call you sunspot? Too much! &quot; Bai Xiaochun looks at Li Qinghou curiously.</p>
<p>Li Qinghou walked in the middle of the air, his face was black, and he looked back at Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember, you don&rsquo;t need to pay attention to your precious medicine, master.&rdquo; With that, Li Qinghou turned and left.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun thinks deeply and admires him even more in the eyes. The secret road is the elixir of Li Qinghou, which makes many people feel heartache and heart black</p>
<p>After seeing Li Qinghou off, he went back to the cave. He remembered the origin of the dragon image Huahai Sutra mentioned by Li Qinghou just now. From the bottom of his heart, he admired the first ancestor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first ancestor mentioned shackles in his opening remarks. In the end, what are shackles?&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun pondered for a moment, but he could not prove it. After shaking his head, he put it in the bottom of his heart, looked at the yuan magnetic bead in his hand, and swallowed it in accordance with Li Qinghou&rsquo;s guidance.</p>
<p>The bead turned into a mass of Qi at the entrance, and it melted into Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s body and circled in the elixir field without any discomfort. Bai Xiaochun felt it for a while and found that her body seemed lighter. After some activities, she immediately noticed that the speed was faster than usual, as if there was some strange connection between the heaven and the earth.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun felt magical and took up the magic wings. The green wings were as thin as cicada wings, which were faint and transparent. Bai Xiaochun opened his mouth and breathed out a breath of aura. He immediately refined the wings. After a stick of incense, his eyes flashed, and the magic wings disappeared and appeared behind him.</p>
<p>As if his wings moved, he felt as if his heart could be moved freely.</p>
<p>In an instant, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s body turned into a remnant, and ran straight to the rock wall in the distance. Bai Xiaochun screamed and stopped, but he didn&rsquo;t control it well. The whole person directly hit the rock wall.</p>
<p>With a bang, the whole cave trembled, but Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s body was too hard. In the collision, it was directly inlaid into the rock wall, and it took a long time to plump down and send out a wail.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun grinned. After climbing up, she looked at the rock wall of a pit. She didn&rsquo;t dare to try in the cave. After she got out of the cave, she summoned up her courage again. With a wing on her back, she ran straight to the distance.</p>
<p>A few days later, Bai Xiaochun was familiar with the speed of the wings. She was very happy and felt invincible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha ha, I&rsquo;m Bai Xiaochun. I can&rsquo;t catch up with me when I&rsquo;m old!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun looked up at the sky and laughed. She flashed around in mid air and returned to the cave.</p>
