      <p>Zhenmo ancient cave, cave entrance.</p>
<p>Before the exquisite witch statue, black wood stands in silence, and the evil spirit black tiger is also silent, standing behind him. Lu Xueqi and others have been in the cave for a long time, not to mention ghost and Li, and for such a long time, no one knows what happened in that ancient cave?</p>
<p>However, the two brothers did not seem to show any concern. In their eyes, it seemed that there was only the statue of the exquisite witch.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, in the silence, the ground under his feet began to tremble slightly, and the faint roar and thunder came out of the ancient cave. Black wood body a shock, turned and black tiger to look at one eye, but before they want to understand, a bigger change has happened.</p>
<p>The originally dark sky was shrouded in the dark clouds above the scorched black mountain. Suddenly, a golden light came out of the sky like a sharp sword and pierced the dark. Then, the edge of the thick black cloud began to emit a light golden light, as if inlaid with a layer of golden light for the black cloud.</p>
<p>For thousands of years, thunder has been heard again over the cursed mountain, and the clouds are surging wildly. It seems that there is some mysterious and unpredictable power, which is constantly waking up and moving the heaven and earth.</p>
<p>Black wood and black tiger were staring at the change of the world. Suddenly, black wood turned around and hesitated for a moment. His voice seemed to tremble slightly and whispered: &ldquo;Yinfeng It&rsquo;s gone. &quot;</p>
<p>The huge body of the black tiger gazed into the deep cave. In the deep darkness, there was no chilly wind any more. Instead, it was a blazing heat wave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on? What&rsquo;s going on inside?&rdquo; Black wood&rsquo;s voice was a little excited, but his face covered by black cloth could not see his expression clearly, but he was staring at the ancient cave.</p>
<p>On the contrary, the black tiger faced these changes. The expression is very complex and strange, it seems that there is unspeakable joy, but the face composed of white smoke, there is still a trace of sadness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fire dragon. Eight barren fire dragons! &quot; His light, low voice way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blackwood quickly turned around in disbelief, staring at the black tiger and said, &ldquo;what do you mean, the eight barren fire dragon.</p>
<p>How could anyone in the world, besides the empress, be able to summon the eight barren fire dragons? &quot;</p>
<p>The black tiger&rsquo;s eyes were dim, and slowly turned to the stone statue. After a long time, he said, &ldquo;there was no one, because the summoning mantra and the essence of ten thousand fire, Xuan Huo Jian, had already been lost. However,&rdquo; he laughed and then looked at black wood with a strange look. &ldquo;However, there is still a person in the world who has understood all her magic magic and incantations, and the only eight fierce XuanHuo array that can summon the eight wasteland fire dragons, which was laid by the empress before her life, happened to be here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a long time, he shook his head and said, &ldquo;so he He still has this skill. But the eight barren fire dragon is a fierce thing that destroys all things. When he calls on this divine beast, does he forget that his mother used this fire dragon to burn him up? &quot;</p>
<p>The black tiger sneered and said, &ldquo;who knows. I only remember a word that my mother said to me when she was dying when she left. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; he said</p>
<p>Black tiger&rsquo;s face showed a strong hatred, Huoran turned around. Looking at the old Zhenmo cave, which was becoming more and more obvious and shaking, she sneered: &ldquo;Niang told me that no matter how many years later, once the fire dragon comes back, it will come here. This is the end of this injustice! &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the injustice is over&hellip;&rdquo; Suddenly, his face changed and he said, &ldquo;did she expect that already?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The black tiger did not pay attention to him. For him, when the blazing wind became more and more intense, the clouds in the sky rolled, the golden awns flashed in disorder, and the world was in chaos, he only had the stone statue in his eyes.</p>
<p>He moved slowly to the stone statue. All the expressions on his face disappeared, and he whispered: &ldquo;Niang Niang, Niang I have finally come to this day. Don&rsquo;t worry. Wait a little longer. When everything is over, the black tiger will come to you and serve you forever. &quot;</p>
<p>Ebony looked at the elder brother in his previous life, and then he looked up to the sky.</p>
<p>That day, returned to him, but it was a thunder!</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The storm is more urgent, the earth tremor more and more intense.</p>
<p>In the corridor of Zhenmo ancient cave, Zeng Shushu stepped back half step, avoiding a flash of white light, hiding in the side, but at the same time, he was secretly complaining.</p>
<p>Since Li Xun and others have somehow provoked a woman in white in the ancient magic cave of the town, it seems that this woman is more charming than the Golden Vase, but her Taoism is incredible. Li Xun and other disciples of the burning incense Valley flock to her, but she uses a magic skill to block all of them. At the moment, all the people are given a magic Trapped.</p>
<p>It was as like as two peas in the same way as the little white, what the mysterious white light ball rushed toward the crowd, and the burning incense brothers hit them with their own magic weapons. But the more the more they played, the less they started. But after a while, the cave was already covered with white brilliance. There are many disciples in the burning incense Valley, but their ability to cope with the situation is not as good as that of the Golden Vase. The white body of light almost immediately generated countless, and they rushed in the air. Those disciples who just wanted to catch Xiaobai and punish them were crying bitterly.</p>
<p>Seeing the disciples of the burning incense Valley in trouble, Zeng Shushu could not stand by and had to join the war. However, the woman in white has a very high road. Zeng Shushu can&rsquo;t catch up with her. On the contrary, she is surrounded by many white light balls. However, after all, Zeng Shushu was very clever. After only a few rounds, he knew that there was something different. He quickly and loudly reminded the disciples of the burning incense Valley nearby not to cut these white light balls at random. All of them came to their senses.</p>
<p>But for all that, the white light body is already all over the sky. These righteous disciples are surrounded tightly, shooting from east to west, and everyone is in a hurry.</p>
<p>Xiaobai slowly fell from the sky and fell to the ground. Looking at the white light flashing in front of him and the embarrassed appearance of the people in the burning incense Valley, he sneered and breathed a long breath. Although she has been preaching for thousands of years, she is definitely not a benevolent and open-minded immortal. She has been imprisoned in the xuanhuotan by the burning incense Valley for hundreds of years. Although this evil breath was let off lightly that day, she did not bother the people of the burning incense valley. It&rsquo;s burn Gaoxiang, a disciple of the incense valley. Now she actually sent it to the door. It happened that she was talking with GUI Li, and she was in a bad mood. It&rsquo;s like hitting the muzzle of a gun.</p>
<p>It was at this time that suddenly, Xiaobai&rsquo;s heart was filled with pride and a feeling of palpitation that had never been felt before, which suddenly rose from the bottom of his heart. The heart is more involuntarily jump a few times.</p>
<p>An ancient and violent force rose slowly in the front, deep in the ancient cave, as if sleeping for thousands of years, and finally woke up for the first time. But the beginning of this awakening has turned heaven and earth into color.</p>
<p>The sound of thunder came slowly from the depths of the earth, and then came from afar like waves. The earth began to shake violently. This time, countless huge stones have begun to fall, it seems that they can not bear the huge force of rebirth.</p>
<p>All the people were shocked. In a panic, Zeng Shushu tried his best to greet Li Xun and yelled: &ldquo;senior brother Li, it&rsquo;s too dangerous here. We&rsquo;d better go out first!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li Xun looks pale. As like as two peas of a ball, the ball was hit by a single sword, and the white light ball was just a little bigger than the chaos. After that, the ball was hit by a few feet away, but it was divided into two identical balls. Again in the mid air to accumulate strength, see to rush again. However, since the sudden change, Xiaobai seems to have a side-by-side care, and the speed of these light balls has also slowed down.</p>
<p>Li Xun, who had been forced to do so, was blue and white on his face, and suddenly he bit his teeth. &ldquo;All out, I&rsquo;ll be dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, he flew to his feet. At that time, his sword was so powerful that he blocked most of the white light. The people of the burning incense Valley always respected him. After hearing the words, they looked around and found that it was not a place to stay for a long time.</p>
<p>However, Li Xun didn&rsquo;t seem to want to go. Zeng Shushu flew over and blocked several white light balls for him. He said in a loud voice: &ldquo;senior brother Li, why don&rsquo;t you go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A flicker of hesitation flashed on Li Xun&rsquo;s face and said, &ldquo;but Sister Lu is still there. &quot;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu frowned and said angrily, &ldquo;sister Lu, she has a profound way. She may not have anything to do. If you insist on it like this, you are afraid to mislead others and yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li Xun&rsquo;s face changed a few times, but he could only see that the vibration around him was more intense. After a long time, the trend of falling rocks did not weaken, but became more intense. He sighed and finally flew back.</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu took a look at the deep cave and went out with it.</p>
<p>Those people&rsquo;s dialogue, each sentence fell in the small white ear, but for her, in addition to a faint sneer, nothing touched the heartstrings.</p>
<p>The white light ball in the hole moves more and more slowly. After Li Xun and Zeng Shushu&rsquo;s figures also disappear rapidly, the lost white light ball gradually stops in the air, then gradually gathers, slowly merges, and gradually reconstitutes into a white light ball and flies towards Xiaobai.</p>
<p>Xiaobai slowly turns around and looks into the deep cave.</p>
<p>That ancient and huge force is still constantly strengthening. Xiaobai can even clearly feel that there is an extremely powerful destructive force. The surrounding rock wall was still shaking and flaking off stones, large and small, falling to the ground in the roar. Only within three feet of her figure, no stone could hit her body.</p>
<p>The white light ball flew back to her side, like a little elf, flying around her, seemed to be trying to figure out the master&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<p>But on the master&rsquo;s blank face, some are only worried and lost.</p>
<p>That deep darkness, at this moment, burst out a roar, such as the roar of a dragon, dragon chant to the sky.</p>
<p>That mysterious ancient power, finally fully awakened!</p>
<p>The huge stone chamber was completely shrouded by the strong fire, and the previous darkness was completely expelled, and there was no dark place to be found. This light, far more than any light in the world, even makes people feel, even if the sky sun comes, I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s just like this.</p>
<p>The once invincible red flame Warcraft, if compared with it, is just like a little firefly.</p>
<p>Among the forces of terror, the most blazing place is undoubtedly the halo of the eight evils statue, which still exists and rotates rapidly, flashing a strange aura. There, the flame that the beast God used to blend into is becoming more and more white hot, and the mysterious mantra is becoming more and more urgent.</p>
<p>Constantly expanding and slightly shrinking, the undulating heart of the fireworks is like an egg of hatching red flame, containing something terrible. With the continuous rapid rise of the surrounding temperature, the ancient and mysterious place is. Bit by bit, the power of losing thousands of years has come back to the world.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi and GUI Li, two people, have been completely squeezed to the edge of the stone chamber on the wall, too strong flame force. Is baking their body and mind, squeezing every drop of water in their bodies.</p>
<p>There is no sweat, because every drop of sweat has evaporated before it flows out, reflecting their red faces in the flames.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi suddenly felt something.</p>
<p>Looking at the ghost nearby, the man, I don&rsquo;t know when, took her hand. She did not have any astonishment, even in this desperate fire in the face of the unknown mysterious power.</p>
<p>In the palm of the hand, on the fingertip, came the warmth.</p>
<p>Once familiar with it! Ten years ago, it was like this!</p>
<p>The past of a hand in the dark!</p>
<p>The ghost Li body moves, left the wall that two people lean against, block in front of Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s body, light blue light. In the middle, a faint golden light flashed from his hand, forming a wall of light, blocking his body.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, the intense heat lightened a lot, but his back trembled slightly, and then he inhaled deeply.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the hand in the palm of his hand grasped him. From behind him, the light blue light rises. At first, there seems to be some conflict with the blue light. Incompatible, but soon, the two rays of light merged into one, forming a stronger light wall to resist the terrible flame of fire.</p>
<p>Man&rsquo;s shoulder, man&rsquo;s back. Standing in front of her in silence, Lu Xueqi held her hands tightly. At the corner of her mouth, there was a faint smile under the fire.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, the lengthy mantra stopped. For a moment, it seemed that everything was frozen in an instant. All the flames, the flames all over the sky, the ghostly and Lu Xueqi struggling to resist, and the eight evil gods in the sky.</p>
<p>In the depths of the most blazing flame, it slowly cracked away, from a slit, slowly growing, from a gap about the size of a person, into a huge void several times. In this dazzling fire all over the sky, that crack, it seems to be the deepest incredible darkness.</p>
<p>Then, like something, in the deep crack, coldly, looked at the outside world.</p>
<p>A ferocity, filled with maddening despair, swept every corner of the stone chamber in an instant.</p>
<p>At the next moment, if stimulated by the craziest, all the flames burst out the most warm light. The sound of the Dragon chanting is rising higher and higher, like a carnival. In the depths of the fire, the sound of dragon chanting roared up, with terror and despair. The ancient gods and spirits came into it from another world.</p>
<p>The huge head, slowly stretched out, was as dazzling as the sun and could not be seen directly. It was clearly a huge ancient fire dragon bathed in the fire. Everywhere, it was a flame.</p>
<p>The giant dragon head has occupied all the space. GUI Li and Lu Xueqi stare at the invincible and almost transcendent creatures in this world. They even forget to resist. They just rely on their instinct and struggle to resist the turbulent fire with their magic weapons. However, the suffocating power seems to have announced their fate.</p>
<p>Eight barren fire dragon!</p>
<p>In the ancient Wuzu legend of Southern Xinjiang, the most ultimate spirit summoned by the eight fierce XuanHuo array, which destroys all things in the world, finally reappears in the world after thousands of years.</p>
<p>The huge dragon&rsquo;s head, slowly rotating in the flame, did not immediately destroy anything. Surrounded by the flame, from its huge horns to its tusks in its mouth, it presents a mysterious red and transparent color that can only flash in extreme high temperature.</p>
<p>Every time the Dragon breathed deeply, it made the whole stone chamber tremble violently. It seemed that this space was just a small place for such a powerful creature as it. Even its body has not yet come out.</p>
<p>Behind the dragon&rsquo;s head, the rotating eight ferocious God&rsquo;s halo seems to be disappearing in the dazzling light of the eight wild fire dragons. In the looming, the huge aperture seems to be shaking slightly.</p>
<p>Is it because of the desperate power of the dragon?</p>
<p>Or is it attached to the memories of a long time ago?</p>
<p>No one knows.</p>
<p>No one will think about that again, because at this moment, it seems to be slowly adapted to the strange feeling of the giant dragon after waking up. Above the dragon head, in the huge red and transparent eyes, the burning flame slowly rises, and the dragon head slowly turns around.</p>
<p>A moment later, the terrible dragon head was facing the two figures in the stone room, who were struggling to resist in the corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roar!&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>In an instant, the huge roar resounded through the whole world! (to be continued. )</p>
