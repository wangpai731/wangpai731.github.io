<p>Looking around, several fat elder martial brothers are staring at themselves. The light of the spirit stone seems to flash in those small eyes. Especially when Zhang daphou looks at himself, his eyes are like fire Bai Xiaochun had a dry cough and felt a little proud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elder martial brother, you see, every month, our lingxizong will open trials on three mountain peaks, giving me and other laborers a chance to leap over the dragon&rsquo;s gate, right&hellip;&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun raised her white face, and she was extremely clever.</p>
<p>Hearing Bai Xiaochun say so, Zhang daphou and others nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We should choose the best from the best, so no matter how many people take part in the trial every month, every mountain will only choose the first three who can finish the test fastest, right?&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun licked his lips, and his eyes began to shine. When he said this, Zhang Da Pang was thoughtful.</p>
<p>There are black three fat, it is the same, as for other people are ignorant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean&hellip;&rdquo; Zhang daphou looks at Bai Xiaochun, and his eyes slowly show his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Based on the accomplishments of the senior brothers, including me, we can actually go to the top of the trail of every mountain peak&hellip;&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun looks at several senior brothers around him. Each of them is the third layer of condensate gas, especially Zhang daphou and Hei sanpang, which are already the peak of the third layer of gas condensate. If they were not suppressed at all times and didn&rsquo;t want to be too conspicuous, they would have broken through long ago.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, as long as we get to the top of each trial and occupy the first three places, we can Sell places to the people behind you Bai Xiaochun said quickly and looked at Zhang daphou and others.</p>
<p>Zhang daphou&rsquo;s body trembled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too bad&hellip;&rdquo; He took a breath and slapped his thigh fiercely. His eyes showed unprecedented light. This method is not complicated and extremely simple. It is just a change of thinking. Everyone understands it after he says it, but when he doesn&rsquo;t say it, it is the opposite of people&rsquo;s thinking.</p>
<p>At the moment, Zhang Da Pang even has a kind of feeling that he has opened a brand-new door in his life. He can&rsquo;t help laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the ultimate damage, ha ha!&rdquo; Black three fat a stomp, the face does not know is shy or excited, suffused with bursts of red.</p>
<p>Several other fat elder martial brothers, at the moment, are all responding and excited, one by one shortness of breath. When they look at Bai Xiaochun, they can&rsquo;t help but admire them more and more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s OK. I&rsquo;ll do it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His grandmother&rsquo;s son of a bitch in the supervisor&rsquo;s room have made us poor for so many years. Fortunately, the ninth junior brother came and did it!&rdquo; The crowd was excited and discussed some details with each other.</p>
<p>After everyone felt that there was no omission, he was ready to do so when the road of trial was opened next month. Zhang dabong patted his stomach happily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Extra dinner tonight!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the next month, everyone in the fire kitchen was full of energy. Even in order to be safe, they practiced for a few days. Finally, they were waiting for the date to come.</p>
<p>Finally, the day arrived.</p>
<p>In the morning, the sun is shining. Under the three peaks on the South Bank of lingxizong, an unprecedented scene appears. At the entrance of the trail road under each peak, there are three big black pots.</p>
<p>Take a closer look, under the big black pot, a fat man stands there majestically, imposing.</p>
<p>It was the nine people in the fireplace. They were the first group of laborers who went to the trail of three peaks. According to the previous arrangement, there were three people and one peak.</p>
<p>At the moment, a large number of factotum are coming from all directions. They are full of spirit. Some of them have failed several times, while others are taking part in the trial for the first time. They are anxious and eager to make great achievements from now on, and to be promoted from the factotum to the outside disciple.</p>
<p>But as they approached, when they came to the peak of their choice, they immediately saw the fat people in the fire stove.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fire kitchen? How did they come? &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been a factotum for nine years, and I&rsquo;ve taken part in more than 30 trials. This is the first time I&rsquo;ve seen people from the fire stove appear here&hellip;&rdquo; When the servants were surprised, they communicated with each other. When they knew that all the three mountains had stoves, they all immediately began to hum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something&rsquo;s wrong. The people from the fire kitchen room should come to grab the place of the disciples of the outer gate. How can it be&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the face of the surprised comments of the servants around, Bai Xiaochun, Zhang daphou and Heisan Pang, who are at the bottom of the third peak, look calm, as if they are wandering in vain and ignore all the discussions around them.</p>
<p>They have focused all their attention on the trial entrance around them, waiting for the moment of opening. In their opinion, this is not a road of trial, but a road of shining spirit stone.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun, in particular, looked very serious and could not blink his eyes.</p>
<p>Soon, there were three figures floating down from the three peaks. On the top of the mountain where Bai Xiaochun was, he was a middle-aged man with a good character. When he came to the test road, he saw Zhang daphou&rsquo;s body like a meat mountain.</p>
<p>His eyes swept over Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s body, and the middle-aged monk, as the deacon in charge of the road of trial, was also surprised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is the sun coming out in the west? The people in the fire stove don&rsquo;t want to be the disciples of the outside world every day. Why are they here today? &quot;</p>
<p>He couldn&rsquo;t help but look at it more and more. With a big sleeve swinging, his voice spread all over the place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The trial of promotion to other disciples, start!&rdquo; As soon as his words came out, a bell was ringing in the temple. At the same time, the entrance of the road to practice flashed and opened in an instant.</p>
<p>Just at the moment of opening, Zhang daphou was persistent, and his figure called out. He set off a gust of wind. He ran up the mountain steps as if there were fierce beasts behind him.</p>
<p>The same is true of Hei San Pang. His eyes show ferocity. It seems that whoever tries with him is robbing him of his life and following Zhang daphou.</p>
<p>The third is Bai Xiaochun. He is faster, like a rabbit. His head is full of longevity pills. He jumps away. In a flash, the three people are running on the mountain road.</p>
<p>At this time, the rest of the factotum just reacted, one by one, their faces changed, their teeth clenched and they ran on the road of trial, and they quickly chased towards the top of the mountain.</p>
<p>Not only this mountain is like this, but the other two peaks are the same. All the people running in the front are the fat people in the fire kitchen.</p>
<p>The third peak is called Xiangyun peak. At the moment, on the way of trial, Bai Xiaochun and Bai Xiaochun are very fast and far ahead, but they all slow down gradually. They feel the pressure coming from all sides, like a heavy burden on their bodies.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun quickly looked back and found that there were seven or eight people behind him. When he was a little worried, he felt that the longevity pill was about to be snatched away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Robbing me of life prolonging pill is robbing my life!&rdquo; He held his breath, his face became more and more red, and the aura in his body suddenly spread and turned into a power. For example, the wild boar who was trampled on its tail rushed out with a bang, directly surpassing heisanpang and Zhang daphou, and his speed was more than doubled.</p>
<p>Black three fat also roared at the moment, I don&rsquo;t know what means to start, the same speed increase, and Zhang daphou overtakes, followed by Bai Xiaochun, when both of them are about to run, Zhang daphou is in a hurry.</p>
<p>He took a deep breath. The fat on his body shrank in a small circle with the naked eye. It was like the fat in his body was burned. His speed suddenly increased. He caught up with the black three plums, and they left together.</p>
<p>Seeing this scene, all the servants behind them were stunned, and soon showed despair. However, they were not reconciled and tried their best. However, they could not catch up with Bai Xiaochun. Some of them were angry and scolded directly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn it, did they eat spring. Medicine, why so fast</p>
<p>After a stick of incense, Bai Xiaochun, who was always in the front, had reached the top of the mountain. He even saw two outside disciples waiting at the exit, ready to enroll the factotum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Congratulations to teacher&hellip;&rdquo; At the exit of the top of the mountain, the two outer disciples, seeing Bai Xiaochun arrive, smile slightly. They just said three words, but before they finished, they immediately opened their eyes and stood there.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s body thumped, staggered out a few steps, and then stopped in an instant. It was only one step away from the top of the exit of the trail road in front of him.</p>
<p>He looked at the two outer disciples in front of him, and the two outer disciples also looked at him. After Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s clever smile, he immediately turned around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; When he turned around, he raised his hand behind him and roared. Suddenly, black three fat and Zhang Da Pang immediately followed him. They all gasped for breath. At the position near the exit, they all gasped. You look at me, I look at you, and they all laugh happily.</p>
<p>However, the two outer disciples at the exit behind them looked at each other, and some of them couldn&rsquo;t figure out the situation. They didn&rsquo;t know whether the three were suffering from head wind. When they arrived here, they didn&rsquo;t even come up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three younger martial brothers, you are the first to come here. You can come here. If you walk through here, you will be promoted to other disciples.&rdquo; One of the two disciples of the outer gate opened his mouth with kindness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Outside disciple? Who wants to be a layman. &quot; Zhang daphou waved his hand and sat there with Hei San Pang. The two meat mountains blocked the gate of the exit directly.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun sat in front of them, raised his chin and waited with pride on his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah? I don&rsquo;t want to be an outsider. What are you doing here? There&rsquo;s something wrong with it! &quot; The two outer disciples were not happy.</p>
<p>In the face of the two disciples&rsquo; words, Zhang daphou and others turned a deaf ear and fixed their eyes on the foot of the mountain.</p>
<p>When he saw Bai Xiaochun three people, he sighed and was not reconciled in his eyes. This was the ninth time he took part in the trial. Now it is the most promising time, but he met the fire stove.</p>
<p>His face was full of grief and anger. When he was about to turn around and give up, Bai Xiaochun quickly stood up and began to shout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This elder martial brother, don&rsquo;t go. Come here. I think about it for a while. I can&rsquo;t bear the fire stove. Suddenly, I don&rsquo;t want to be a disciple of the outside school. Otherwise, this quota&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Horseface worker a Leng, eyes suddenly a bright.</p>
