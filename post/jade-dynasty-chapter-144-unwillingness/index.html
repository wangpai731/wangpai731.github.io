      <p>The forest gradually quieted down. A moment ago, the monsters who were still barking fiercely were scattered far away. The speed was so fast that Qinglong was really surprised. But in his mind, the reaction of the Golden Vase son when he saw this strange boy was even more elusive to him?</p>
<p>The young man&rsquo;s eyes fell on both of them. He looked at them carefully and said, &ldquo;are you Chinese?&rdquo;</p>
<p>What the young man said was soft, pleasant and pure Chinese language. Qinglong was stunned for a moment and asked, &ldquo;who are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man grinned and showed two rows of white teeth. He looked naive. He was out of tune with the bloody scene around him. He just said with a smile: &ldquo;who am I? That&rsquo;s a good question, &ldquo;he said slowly.&rdquo; who am I? &quot;</p>
<p>Qinglong snorted and lowered his voice: &ldquo;I am Zong Qinglong, the ghost king. Who is this person?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jin Pinger is surprised. Obviously, she also knows the name of Qinglong. Originally, the three major sects of the demon sect have always been fighting fiercely. As an outstanding disciple of the new generation of Huan sect, Jin pinger has never seen Qinglong, but the information of this important figure in the ghost King clan has already been familiar with.</p>
<p>At the moment, he nodded slightly, which was a greeting. Originally, from their standpoint, they were regarded as enemies and not friends. However, at this moment, in this remote place of Southern Xinjiang, monsters were rampant, and both of them could not help but regard each other as comrades in arms.</p>
<p>The Golden Vase son looked at the young man in front of him and said in a low voice, &ldquo;be careful, he is the beast demon. All the monsters around him are his subordinates, and his moral conduct is very high.&rdquo; She pauses for a moment, and then whispers, &ldquo;Daofa is also very strange.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Qinglong frowned and was about to ask more questions, but there was a roar from the direction behind him, and then the trees fell to the ground. The two quickly turned their heads and saw that the white bone snake demon rushed all the way, but there were no other demons beside him. I think they are the same as other monsters. Frightened by the appearance of beast demon, I dare not approach here.</p>
<p>Qinglong unexpectedly caught up with the white bone snake demon so quickly. Seeing that the snake demon was in front of him in an instant, accompanied by a fishy wind. The white shadow flashed, and the huge body of the snake demon swept over.</p>
<p>In front of these monsters, the big trees that have grown for many years are almost swept by like grass. In the roar, they are uprooted one after another and fly towards this side.</p>
<p>The green dragon and the Golden Vase jump at the same time.</p>
<p>Both of them were not ordinary people. At one glance, they could see that the White Bone Demon snake in front of him was not an ordinary monster. It was full of evil spirit and was obviously of high moral character. But what&rsquo;s more important is that the mysterious youth in front of him did not attack from the beginning to the end, but they could not see the depth of it in any case.</p>
<p>Qinglong was just worried, but the Golden Vase seemed to know more than Qinglong. He was very nervous, even when facing the white bone snake demon. Half of my mind seems to be behind my back.</p>
<p>Jinpinger, like this, naturally can&rsquo;t escape the eyes of the experienced green dragon. At the moment, they did not fight with the White Bone Demon snake directly. Instead, they pursued flying around the white bone snake demon relying on their body skills. Occasionally, they took advantage of the opportunity to snipe at the white bone snake demon. However, the snake demon&rsquo;s body seemed extremely tough, and the ordinary magic weapon Daofa could not hurt it.</p>
<p>But has been unable to catch up with Qinglong and jinpinger, the white bone snake demon roars repeatedly, the huge body constantly distorts, the speed is actually faster and faster. There was no clumsy appearance, and gradually caught up with them.</p>
<p>Qinglong was shocked that the white bone snake demon was already so difficult to deal with. The boy who was called animal demon by the golden bottle was the leader of these monsters. It&rsquo;s more terrible. When the thought turned, his heart sprouted. As he flew past the Golden Vase, he said in a hurry: &ldquo;go</p>
<p>The Golden Vase son obviously also does not want to stay here for a long time, immediately nods, simultaneously hand points to the sky.</p>
<p>Green dragon will understand. Almost at the same time, the two men uttered a rebuke. A clear light on the green dragon&rsquo;s hand was mixed with the purple light of the Golden Vase, and hit the bone vertebrae of the white bone snake demon from the side. Rao is a white bone snake demon with thick bones. He is also beaten backward by these two masters. The snake is soft. Several shakes will dissipate this force, but it is already under pressure and can not catch up.</p>
<p>Qinglong takes advantage of this space, whistles softly, and rises into the air. However, at the moment when his body is flying, his mind suddenly moves. The light from the corner of his eyes looks to the side. As expected, the Golden Vase does not fly upward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roar&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>At a moment of wonder in Qinglong&rsquo;s heart, the originally clear sky suddenly turned black, and a black curtain suddenly appeared on his head which had just flown out of the branch, and rushed down like a mountain and a sea.</p>
<p>At that critical moment, Qinglong was on guard against danger. On his right hand, the &ldquo;heaven and earth Qingguang ring&rdquo; was in full bloom. In a flash, he protected his whole body, and at the same time, his body moved sideways.</p>
<p>But even so, the attack under the black curtain was fantastic. With a loud bang, the light ring of the green dragon&rsquo;s body protection was strongly hit and flew out. At the same time, Qinglong clearly saw that the Golden Vase turned into a purple light and flew into the sky from behind the black curtain. From a distance, he heard her soft laughter</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, uncle. I&rsquo;m lucky in the future. Thank you in person!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Qinglong tried to hold back the flow of Qi and blood in his chest, and showed a wry smile at the corners of his mouth.</p>
<p>But at this time, where could he care about the Golden Vase, he reached out in mid air and grabbed the trunk of a big tree. With a &ldquo;hissing&rdquo; sound, his palm fell deeply into the wood, and his body immediately turned around and fell down.</p>
<p>But the next moment, the white bone snake demon had already chased after him, but he did not rush up immediately. On the head of a huge snake, the snake hissed. As for the darkness ahead, it fell to the ground at the moment, and disappeared with a whoosh. The speed was rare.</p>
<p>But it was the enchanting young man who, like a ghost, appeared in front of the green dragon one foot away, standing with his hands down.</p>
<p>Qinglong fell to the ground and breathed a breath. He was stopped. But he was not in a hurry to escape. He just frowned and looked at the young man. Suddenly, he said, &ldquo;the monster in the sky just now, but the legendary&rdquo; Taotie &quot;</p>
<p>The young man raised his eyebrows and eyes, but a smile appeared at the corner of his mouth. He nodded his head and said, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe you have some vision. It&rsquo;s good. It&rsquo;s gluttonous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roar!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the youth&rsquo;s words, this time the strange sound is light and low, from behind the youth. A moment later, a ferocious monster head slowly came out from behind the young figure.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not clear what kind of animal the head looks like, but it has four eyes the size of a copper bell. Two pairs of upper and lower sides of the face, six sharp fangs exposed from the big mouth, and mouth saliva constantly dripping from it. On the gray black skin, is full of one grain thick lump, is the world legend most ferocious ghost. I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s not as ugly and ferocious as this monster.</p>
<p>Qinglong took a breath!</p>
<p>Taotie&rsquo;s neck seemed to be very long. The strange head stretched out a lot from behind the boy, turned around, and actually spared him to the shoulder in front of him. However, the young man looked calm in front of such a fierce beast.</p>
<p>Qinglong calmed his mind and said slowly, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe that there are such fierce beasts in the world!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man smiles and reaches out his hand. He even touches the head of Taotie, which seems to be extremely vicious. But under the hands of the teenagers, they just murmur and roar, and rub their hands with their heads. If they are not too fierce, they are almost like a dog.</p>
<p>The young man took a look at the green dragon and suddenly said, &ldquo;the woman was your companion just now. She knew that Taotie was hidden in the air, but she deliberately asked you to be bait. After leading Taotie down, she ran away. You must be very angry in your heart now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Qinglong is on guard. But he said with a smile: &ldquo;she put one, but I am incompetent, no wonder people!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man looked at him more, nodded and said, &ldquo;in that case. You will die. &quot;</p>
<p>The voice did not fall, nor did he have any movement, but the White Bone Demon snake, who had been looking at the tiger behind the green dragon, suddenly seemed to have been ordered to open its mouth and swallow it down.</p>
<p>Qinglong has been alert, although the White Bone Demon snake protuberance is difficult. However, he did not panic, did not retreat, but went forward, and directly rushed to the White Bone Demon snake, which startled the snake demon.</p>
<p>While the snake demon was stunned, the green dragon had already rushed under the snake demon, dodged the poisonous gas from the angry snake demon, kicked the huge body of the demon snake forward three feet with his feet, and rose up with the help of the force. The light in his hands was bright, and he immediately laid down six light walls in the direction of Taotie.</p>
<p>Among the two animals and one man, the one he was most afraid of was the young man who had never made a move.</p>
<p>The White Bone Demon snake roared and roared, but it was unable to catch up with him. Seeing that the green dragon was about to fly to the sky, he had to get rid of the trap. Suddenly, his body was caught by one hand. A moment later, a deep laugh came from his body. A strong force came from that hand. The green dragon felt that his body was suddenly burning with heat, and his body was shaking. He could not help being thrown out by this hand.</p>
<p>In the middle of the sky, I saw his body floating. With the sound of breaking the branch, the body of Qinglong was thrown into the forest again.</p>
<p>In the forest, again sounded the roar of countless monsters.</p>
<p>In mid air, the young man closed his eyes slightly and looked up to the sky. There was a wind blowing through his bright silk clothes, hunting and dancing.</p>
<p>There is a roar in the distance</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Qingyun Mountain, Tongtian peak, Yuqing hall.</p>
<p>The Qingyun gate is in charge of the gate. Under xuanzhenren, the front seats of each vein gather in the hall. There are also many elders standing behind the head seat. Few of them stand at the gate of Yuqing hall. They look like they are waiting for someone.</p>
<p>No matter who is able to get such a courtesy as Qingyun gate, he is already the first-class person in the world.</p>
<p>In addition to the people of Qingyun gate, Li Xun also stood at the bottom of the hall. He stood quietly and respectfully, but there was a faint look of excitement in his eyes. His eyes looked at the other side from time to time.</p>
<p>There, Lu Xueqi in white is standing behind the indifferent master Shuiyue.</p>
<p>After a while, the melodious sound of the bell and tripod came from the distant Qingyun Mountain, and there were five sounds in succession. All the people present looked out of the hall one after another</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master of burning incense Valley, Yunyi, Lanyun, the old man worships the mountain&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Almost at the same time, a flame like figure appeared at the gate of Yuqing hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha ha, where is elder martial brother daoxuan? I want to die!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yun Yilan, dressed in red and full of smiles, strides in, followed by shangguance, Lvshun and other disciples of the incense burning Valley elders. Looking at the number, there are nearly dozens of them.</p>
<p>The crowd in Qingyun gate made a small voice of suspicion, but after a moment, everyone&rsquo;s eyes were focused on the face of Yun Yilan. This man, who has been famous for many years in the world, was once a powerful character at that time. Most of the elder elders of Qingyun gate who were present at the scene had seen him, but at the moment, they all only felt astonished.</p>
<p>This face is vaguely similar, but clearly only in the middle of life. Is it really the cloud Yi Lan that has been white hair for decades?</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan looked at Yun Yilan carefully. He came forward and said with a smile, &ldquo;benefactor Yun, I haven&rsquo;t seen you for many years. Unexpectedly, you have made great progress in Taoism. You have already understood the &ldquo;Yuyang realm&rdquo; from the &ldquo;burning incense jade book&rdquo;. Congratulations</p>
<p>Cloud Yi Lan originally smile can be restrained on the face, expression suddenly a stiff. A moment later, a little surprise flashed in his eyes, but his face had returned to nature. He said, &ldquo;elder martial brother daoxuan has a good eyesight. I admire him, I admire him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Daoxuan real man said with a smile, &ldquo;where, where, it should be that I admire you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a moment of laughter, he looked at each other with a smile. Next to him, Li Xun came up, knelt down and saluted: &ldquo;master. I have been waiting here for a long time. &quot;</p>
<p>Cloud Yi Lan nodded and said with a smile: &ldquo;get up, you stay here for a few days, can you appreciate the mystery of Qingyun Mountain this fairyland on earth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li Xun stood up and said in a respectful voice: &ldquo;Qingyun Mountain is really worthy of its reputation. I&rsquo;ve opened my eyes. In addition, I&rsquo;d like to thank Master daoxuan and&hellip;&rdquo; He stopped for a moment, Lang Sheng way, &ldquo;and Xiao Zhufeng Lu Xueqi, sister Lu, with me to appreciate this piece of Xianjia scenery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a sudden &ldquo;buzz&rdquo; in the crowd of Qingyun gate. After the discussion, in addition to the elder&rsquo;s head, there are also many younger generation of disciples. Countless eyes immediately turned to the frost woman.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s mouth moved. But his face was indifferent, and finally he didn&rsquo;t say anything.</p>
<p>Taoist immortal laughed and took Yun Yi Lan&rsquo;s hand and said, &ldquo;the master of cloud Valley has such a good disciple. There are successors. Come on, please take your seat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cloud Yi Lan leaned over and said, &ldquo;real man, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They looked at each other with a smile. Step up at the same time, daoxuan immortal and Yun Yilan are sitting on the main position together, and there are people in this door on both sides.</p>
<p>After a period of courteous greetings, immortal daoxuan said with a smile: &ldquo;the incense Valley is a great sect of righteousness in the world, and people all over the world respect it. The master of cloud Valley has come here so much that Qingyun gate really shines.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cloud Yi Lan repeatedly shook his head and said, &ldquo;the real person is too flattering, too flattering,&rdquo; he said, his face suddenly changed, and Su Rong said: &ldquo;in fact, there are two big things to ask for from Qingyun men when I come to worship the mountain this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cloud Valley master is so polite. Please say something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yun Yi Lan coughed and said, &ldquo;to tell you the truth, this first thing is related to this rare catastrophe in the world for hundreds of years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the people in Qingyun gate moved one after another. Tian Bu Yi, sitting at the head of daoxuan, frowned and said, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the meaning of cloud Valley master?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yun Yilan sighed and said, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t know. Just a month ago, among the 100000 mountains in southern Xinjiang, which has been guarded by this valley for generations, there is a peerless demon who has been reborn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The immortal daoxuan was stunned for a moment and said, &ldquo;the immortal demon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yun Yilan nodded his head and said, &ldquo;yes, it&rsquo;s a peerless demon. You are far away in the Middle Earth, and you don&rsquo;t know the details of it. But I have been guarding Southern Xinjiang for generations, so I know a lot about it.</p>
<p>This demon is called &ldquo;animal God&rdquo; in ancient times. I don&rsquo;t know where it came from. I only know that it was a disaster in the world and slaughtered countless creatures&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>Sitting next to Tian Buyi and the head of fenghuifeng, uncle Zeng often frowned and said, &ldquo;can&rsquo;t you deal with this demon with the cloud Valley master&rsquo;s Tongtian Dao and the strength of the incense burning Valley?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yun Yilan looked gloomy and said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, you guys. I don&rsquo;t dare to bear the responsibility. I know it&rsquo;s not trivial. It&rsquo;s beyond the ability of the burning incense Valley family to stop it. So I dare to come here. Please look at the world&rsquo;s share of human beings, and let the world fight together. Only in this way can we have the hope of winning. Otherwise, the whole thing will go, and there will be countless deaths and injuries in the world? &quot;</p>
<p>The Qingyun sect members looked at each other. It was good. The incense Valley suddenly jumped out and said a peerless demon. Only when all the monks in the world resisted it could they have hope. How can it be accepted? But after all, immortal XuanZhen was a man of Tao. He pondered for a long time and decided to say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it turns out to be what the master of cloud Valley said, it will be a disaster that has never been seen before. We, as practitioners of Taoism, always boast of the right way, and we can never ignore it. In this case, we, Qingyun gate, will join hands with the burning incense Valley to fight against this demon. Later, I will send a letter to master Puhong of Tianyin temple and ask him to come to Qingyun Mountain to discuss with him. &quot;</p>
<p>Cloud Yi Lan long a breath, caressed a way: &ldquo;so good, little brother this just put down a heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Daoxuan laughed. &ldquo;The cloud Valley master is joking. By the way, I don&rsquo;t know what the second event is. Is it another catastrophe</p>
<p>Cloud Yi Lan&rsquo;s eyes flashed. He took a deep look at daoxuan and said, &ldquo;no, this second thing is a good thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A smile appeared on the corner of the mouth of daoxuan.</p>
<p>Yun Yilan said with a smile: &ldquo;the second thing I&rsquo;ve done here is to serve disciple Li Xun. She proposed to Miss Lu Xueqi</p>
<p>As soon as she said this, Lu Xueqi, standing behind the master Shuiyue, was shocked and raised her head. Meanwhile, in the Qingyun gate, she was like a frying pan. She was in an uproar for a moment. This reaction was more powerful than just hearing that there was a great catastrophe of the immortal demon!</p>
<p>Countless eyes, instantly looked at Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s startled face. A moment later, she was attracted to the past by daoxuan.</p>
<p>Leader of Qingyun sect. Immortal daoxuan pondered for a moment, and said in a loud voice, &ldquo;Li Xun, the child I&rsquo;ve seen these days, is indeed a dragon and Phoenix among people, and his future is limitless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yun Yilan said with a smile: &ldquo;you flatter me, but I really intend to pass on the valley master to this incompetent disciple in the future. When the enemy is in front of us, we have such a happy event, which shows our sincere cooperation and stimulates the morale of heroes in the world. What do you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sitting on the side of the field is not easy to disdain. Almost a cold hum on the hum out, fortunately his wife Su Ru sharp eyed, a pull him.</p>
<p>Daoxuan&rsquo;s eyes moved and swept the people of Qingyun gate. Finally, it landed on Lu Xueqi. Lu Xueqi frowned and her lips trembled slightly. She seemed to say something, but she didn&rsquo;t say it out loud because of the wrong situation.</p>
<p>Taoist immortal smiles. Turn head to cloud Yi Lan smile way: &ldquo;cloud Valley Lord this good intention, still really unexpected ah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yun Yi Lan hugged his fist and said with a smile, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sincere with my little apprentice. I still hope that the real person can complete it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Immortal daoxuan reached out to his chest and stroked his long beard. He said slowly, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s natural demons. The disaster lies in the eyebrows and eyelashes. You and I must work together to save human beings. Moreover, I like this marriage very much, because it is a talented woman&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>There was an uproar in the Qingyun gate. Everyone did not expect that immortal daoxuan actually agreed to this marriage.</p>
<p>After hearing this, immortal daoxuan turned his head and said with a smile to the master Shuiyue, sister Shuiyue, Xueqi is your disciple. You should make up your mind</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s face turned pale, and she was obviously shaken by the incident. At this time, hearing the words of immortal daoxuan, she could not help but take a step and called out to master Shuiyue:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Shuiyue slowly raised his eyes and turned his eyes on Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s unique face. He seemed to want to see something from his face. His eyes were complex and difficult to understand. After a long silence, he slowly said, &ldquo;Qi&rsquo;er, I agree with this marriage. Mr. Li is a good match for dragon and Phoenix. &quot;</p>
<p>Yuqing hall, suddenly together quiet down, including Tian Buyi and others, together are unbelievably looking at master Shuiyue.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s body suddenly shook.</p>
<p>Li Xun, in the distance, was already very happy at the moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha ha ha ha ha ha!&rdquo; Cloud Yi Lan&rsquo;s laughter broke the silence, &ldquo;great, great, since the two elders agree with this matter, xun&rsquo;er, don&rsquo;t you hurry up and thank you two!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li Xun ran up and knelt down.</p>
<p>Yun Yilan said with a smile: &ldquo;today&rsquo;s good story will surely spread through the ages and be praised for the world&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly, a light drink, unexpectedly in the hall, in the world is known as one of the great masters of the world&rsquo;s justice in the voice of cloud Yi Lan, cold ring, interrupted Yun Yi Lan&rsquo;s words.</p>
<p>The whole room was discolored.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi, dressed in white like snow and pale, came out slowly holding Tianya scabbard in one hand.</p>
<p>Daoxuan&rsquo;s face changed slightly, and he looked at master Shuiyue. However, master Shuiyue only looked at Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s figure. Suddenly, he sighed in a low voice, closed his eyes, and looked like he didn&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>Daoxuan real man&rsquo;s face changed again. His face slowly sank down and stood up slowly. He said, &ldquo;Xueqi, do you have anything to say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yuqing hall, silent.</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s eyes were on the woman in white.</p>
<p>Her dress skirt is windless, but it moves gently. From a distance, even her figure is indistinctly like duckweed. It is flimsy and flimsy without wind and rain.</p>
<p>But her lips were so tight, and there was a strange red tide between her pale cheeks. The shoulders that began to shake gently were helpless for the first time.</p>
<p>Suddenly, she suddenly turned around and turned her back to all the people in the Yuqing hall, towards the tall and majestic gate, towards the boundless sky, towards the distance beyond the blue sky, towards the unknown place in the distance——</p>
<p>Deep gaze!</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the feeling at that glance?</p>
<p>On the Yuqing hall, there was her deep but determined voice, like breaking ice and cutting snow</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to!&rdquo;</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Far away.</p>
<p>Strange mountain, crawling in the dark corner of the figure, suddenly trembling.</p>
<p>In the mountains, the sound of insects, which had been one after another, was suddenly cut off.</p>
<p>The figure slowly struggled and stood up in the shadow, as if feeling something, staring at the distance.</p>
<p>The figure of a monkey jumped out of his side and ran up his shoulder.</p>
<p>After a long time, his voice came from the darkness</p>
<p>&ldquo;Xiao Hui, how can my heart suddenly jump so fast&hellip;&rdquo; (to be continued. )</p>
