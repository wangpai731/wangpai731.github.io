      <p>A group of Miao people walked down the mountain. Looking at it, GUI Li and Xiao Bai saw seven or eight strong Miao soldiers surrounded by an old man in his early fifties.</p>
<p>It was the old man who gave out the loud drink just now.</p>
<p>The surrounding Miao soldiers saluted one after another, and the excited crowd suddenly quieted down, and they bowed their heads to pay homage to the old man.</p>
<p>When these people came near, the old man walked out of the crowd and came to Gui Li and Xiao Bai. They looked at him at the same time.</p>
<p>The old man was quite tall. Although he was getting older, white hair appeared on the temples of his hair, but his spirit was very vigorous and his eyes were bright. Now he frowned and looked at them carefully.</p>
<p>Later, the old man said, &ldquo;Gee Li Li Hu Lu, qua la la Lu Lu Hu?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was stunned. It seemed that he was the same as what the soldier had asked just now. I think it means to ask what I am and what I&rsquo;m doing here?</p>
<p>Only he guessed, but he still couldn&rsquo;t understand what he said. &ldquo;We have something important to do. We want to&hellip;&rdquo; Just as he was about to raise his hand, he suddenly realized that he put his hand down and said, &ldquo;I want to see the great wizard in the altar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said this, in fact, his heart is also distressed, these Miao people can not understand his meaning, what is the use of saying it? However, it is even more impolite to say nothing about it. I am afraid that these Miao people will be offended at the moment, and their hearts are extremely anxious.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, it seemed that heaven and man would like it. When the old man heard the fierce talk, he suddenly frowned. He looked at them carefully up and down again. He suddenly said in a half baked Chinese language: &ldquo;you, you are Chinese?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ghost and Xiao Bai were all surprised, and then exultation. At the moment, the most pleasant voice in the world is mostly the old man&rsquo;s earthy speech. GUI Li quickly nodded and said, &ldquo;good, good, we are from the Middle Earth. There&rsquo;s something important. I want to see the great wizard of the noble. &quot;</p>
<p>The old man looked at them and saw that they were wearing the national costume of the southern frontier, but it seemed that the texture was rough. But these two people have extraordinary bearing. Obviously, they are not ordinary businessmen, especially the woman. They are naturally beautiful. Even the ordinary Miao women also despise this set of clothes on her. It has its own flavor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you? What can I do for you The old man said slowly.</p>
<p>GUI Li and Xiao Bai looked at each other, arched their hands and said, &ldquo;this My father-in-law, a friend of mine was seriously injured. Nine tenths of his spirits were scattered and only one was left. It&rsquo;s been like a fake dead person for ten years. It&rsquo;s really&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>When he said this, he could not help but think of the figure of Biyao still lying in the icy stone room of Huqi mountain. When he touched his feelings for a moment, his voice could not help shaking. Although most Miao people can&rsquo;t understand what he said, they can see his expression and listen to his tone. Most of them knew what he was pleading for, but for a moment he felt a little good about him.</p>
<p>As for Xiaobai, standing by the side of GUI Li, with a pair of bright eyes looking at GUI Li, she also put away the faint smile that has been hanging around her mouth, which seems to see through the world, for it is solemn.</p>
<p>The ghost was calm and calm. He said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard the advice of an expert. I must be a stranger who knows how to revive a soul. Use the remaining soul as the basis to perform magic arts and recover the lost soul. I have been searching for it for ten years, but I can&rsquo;t help it. I can&rsquo;t find it. Fortunately, &ldquo;he took a look at Xiaobai, and then said,&rdquo; fortunately, I heard that the great wizard of the aristocracy had such a kind of soul returning magic, so he came to beg for help. I&rsquo;m really grateful! &quot;</p>
<p>The old man frowned after listening. The expression on his face is complicated, but it is not like lying when he looks fierce and sincere. After pondering for a moment, he said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s rare that you Chinese people still have this kind of love, but I can&rsquo;t do it. You wait here for a moment. I&rsquo;ll go to the altar and ask the great wizard to see what he means. If he doesn&rsquo;t want to see you, I can&rsquo;t help it. &quot;</p>
<p>He nodded and said, &ldquo;thank you very much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man nodded. After hesitating for a moment, he turned his head and said a few words in Miao language to several Miao soldiers around him. The soldiers nodded at the same time. Then the old man of the Miao people walked up the mountain alone, and the rest of the Miao soldiers slowly gathered together. Their eyes were fixed on the two men, and they didn&rsquo;t know it was surveillance! Or they were ordered to protect them.</p>
<p>As for the other Miao people who were watching, they saw that the old man was chatting with the two foreigners, and then he ordered some soldiers to watch the people and return to the altar on the mountain. For a moment, they talked and whispered.</p>
<p>Looking at Miao&rsquo;s eyes, he still looks at others with a smile and a smile.</p>
<p>Only Xiao Hui looked around on her shoulder, not interested in these people. Finally, her eyes fell on the river beside her. She was very interested in the fish swimming in it. She kept her eyes on it and grinned from time to time. Body is also ready to move, want to jump into the stream to play.</p>
<p>The altars of the Miao people are all made of huge stones. They are majestic and tall, with a trace of rough and unsophisticated. The old man walked up the mountain road and came to the altar. In front of the altar, there was a platform. It was paved with large rectangular stones. It was quite flat. Behind the platform is the altar.</p>
<p>Two huge stone pillars stand high in front of the altar. At first glance, they are not ten Zhang high. Moreover, there is no crack on the whole stone. They are carved from a whole stone. I really don&rsquo;t know where the ancestors of the Miao people could find such huge stones, and they were able to carry and erect them in front of the altar.</p>
<p>Walking through these two huge pillars, you can see the altar built of stones. The Miao people&rsquo;s altar in qilidong has always been well known in the southern frontier. Half of them are made of huge stones, and the other half are made directly from the mountains and dug out of the hard stone walls.</p>
<p>The old man went in, and the light all around him was dim. The temperature around seems to be much lower than outside.</p>
<p>Obviously, the old man was very famous. He was very familiar with the sacred place in the hearts of the Miao people. Without any hesitation, he went straight to the bottom of the altar. Occasionally, a Miao wizard appeared on the road, and the two sides also said hello to each other. If GUI Li and Xiao Bai see it, they will probably be able to guess the identity of the old man.</p>
<p>Besides the other witches in the altar, only the clan leaders of the whole Miao people can be asked to say hello to them.</p>
<p>The old man continued to walk in through the spacious passage. I came to the deepest part of the altar, the largest room in the altar.</p>
<p>Above the stone gate, hang the decoration made of beast bones, on the surrounding stone walls. Red blood is smeared everywhere to symbolize the piety of ancestor worship.</p>
<p>From the dark, everything here is ferocious.</p>
<p>However, for the Miao people, this is the most sacred place, the old man&rsquo;s face also appeared solemn expression.</p>
<p>I sorted out my clothes and walked in slowly.</p>
<p>In the huge stone chamber, empty, only the inside, burning a group of flame, in the dark is particularly eye-catching.</p>
<p>In front of the fire, there was a strange stone statue carved with the same huge stone. The head was dog shaped, but the body was full, and the feet had sharp claws. Moreover, there are two pairs of wings on the back, which is really a very strange statue, which seems to be the god worshipped by the Miao people.</p>
<p>But there was only one person in the huge stone room. His back was very old and bent. He sat in front of the fire silently, as if in meditation and silence.</p>
<p>This strange place, somehow, gives people a way to keep time. A weird feeling of stagnation.</p>
<p>Here, as if everything is quiet and silent.</p>
<p>The fire was blazing, and the figure of the man in front of the flame was shining bright and dark.</p>
<p>The old man walked up slowly. He stopped about a foot behind the man and said in a low voice and respectfully, &ldquo;the great wizard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The figure sitting in front of the fire moved, and an old voice came: &ldquo;Tu Ma Gu, how did you come back? The will of the dog God, didn&rsquo;t I tell you just now? Is there anything else you are confused about? &quot;</p>
<p>This old man, whom he called Tu Ma Gu, is the head of the Miao Nationality in the southern frontier. Only listen to his respectful way: &ldquo;big wizard, dog God&rsquo;s meaning I know completely, I will certainly do according to the will of dog God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The great wizard still didn&rsquo;t look back. He just heard him say, &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s good. But what is it that makes you turn back? I feel a little uneasy in your heart. &quot;</p>
<p>The chieftain of tumagu frowned slightly and seemed to be hesitant to explain it with any words. After a moment, he decided to say directly: &ldquo;great wizard, there are two strange Chinese people from the lower part of qilidong. They hope to see the great wizard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The big wizard in front of the fire moved, facing the fire and the head of the dog God stone statue in front of the flame also slightly turned around, but only his completely white hair could be seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is it? I haven&rsquo;t walked out of this altar for nearly a hundred years. How could the Chinese people come to me? &quot;</p>
<p>Tu Magu said: &ldquo;yes, I feel very strange, so come up and ask the great wizard, do you want them to come up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The great wizard was silent for a moment and said, &ldquo;what did they say to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tu Magu said: &ldquo;yes, there is a man and a woman. The man said that he wanted to ask a great wizard to help a friend of his to cure a disease.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The great wizard snorted and said, &ldquo;I want to serve the Lord dog God. I have no time to pay attention to these people. You rejected them for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tu Ma Gu was stunned for a moment, but he didn&rsquo;t say anything more. He said, &ldquo;OK, I&rsquo;m going to convey your meaning.&rdquo; Then he turned and walked out.</p>
<p>But he had not gone a few steps, suddenly came from behind the voice of the Wizard: &ldquo;wait a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tu Ma Gu turned around and said, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter, big wizard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The big wizard&rsquo;s rickety figure was still facing the fire, but the old voice slowly came: &ldquo;what disease did they ask me to cure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tu Ma Gu said: &ldquo;listen to them, it&rsquo;s a very strange disease. It seems that nine out of ten of a person&rsquo;s soul&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The figure of the great wizard in the fire suddenly shook.</p>
<p>Tu Ma Gu continued: &ldquo;the man said that he had been instructed by an expert. This situation must be cured by the magic of resurrection. The man also did not know where to get the news, said that the great wizard, you may have this kind of magic, so he wants to ask you to cure. &quot;</p>
<p>Tugu slowly finished speaking, but the big wizard did not respond. He did not move, and did not know what he was thinking.</p>
<p>The fire kept rising and falling, swallowing the firewood in the fire. After waiting for a long time, Tu Ma Gu still didn&rsquo;t see the great wizard speak. Then he hesitated and said, &ldquo;great wizard, I To turn them down and tell them to leave at once</p>
<p>The great wizard was still silent and did not say a word.</p>
<p>Figure Magu turns around slowly. Going out, but just as he was about to walk out of the stone chamber, the voice of the great wizard sounded again.</p>
<p>This time. Even he could hear that the great wizard, who had always been mysterious and wise, seemed to be speaking slowly after a long and complicated thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You Bring them up</p>
<p>GUI Li couldn&rsquo;t help but clench his hand and then slowly extended it. Suddenly, the palms of my hands were full of sweat because of anxiety.</p>
<p>How long, not so excited and longing? With more and more uneasy, GUI Li has been looking at the altar on the hillside. But the old man did not come back after a long time.</p>
<p>Is the great wizard in the altar not willing to heal outsiders?</p>
<p>Or did you do something wrong?</p>
<p>GUI Li couldn&rsquo;t help thinking so, even his heart began to jump faster and faster.</p>
<p>Xiaobai is on the side. Eyes fell on the face of the ghost, looking at this eyes can not cover up the anxious man, that a faint deep feeling, as if engraved on his face.</p>
<p>She sighed softly and turned her head.</p>
<p>There are not as many Miao people around as at the beginning. After all, after waiting so long, the clan leader entered the altar but never came down. There was no command on how to deal with the two foreigners. Quite a number of people left.</p>
<p>But because Xiaobai&rsquo;s appearance is too beautiful. However, it still attracted many young Miao men to stand nearby, boldly looking at her and talking and laughing loudly, thinking that they were talking about her beauty.</p>
<p>As for monkey grey. I don&rsquo;t know when I have jumped off my shoulder and ran to the river. I squatted next to the clear stream and looked at the fish swimming between the stones in the water. I suddenly threw myself down to catch the fish. I don&rsquo;t want the fish to be very cunning. East and West run away from its hands, splashing its own spray.</p>
<p>However, Xiaohui didn&rsquo;t care. He drew back his hand and waited patiently. After a while, the water was calm. The fish came back again. Xiaohui saw the opportunity and jumped down again. So again and again, Xiaohui is very interested in this game and is never tired of playing it.</p>
<p>At the foot of the mountain, the crowd gradually dispersed and the surrounding area returned to calm.</p>
<p>Tu Magu still didn&rsquo;t come back. GUI Li was more and more anxious. Several times, he really wanted to rush up like this, broke into the altar, caught the big wizard and pleaded well. However, when he read about the figure of Biyao, he finally suppressed his idea.</p>
<p>The taste of waiting is such a torment.</p>
<p>The anxious expression on his face gradually became apparent. In addition to Xiaobai&rsquo;s eyes, those Miao soldiers also saw each other and looked at each other. In fact, these Miao soldiers were also very strange.</p>
<p>Just a question, how can it take so long? Is there anything else important about the patriarch and the great wizard?</p>
<p>The Miao people are rough and plain. Although they still don&rsquo;t know the identity of GUI Li and others, they are embarrassed to have them wait here for such a long time.</p>
<p>A moment later, the tall little leader came up and said to the ghost gruffly, &ldquo;hululu, Gualala!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was stunned and didn&rsquo;t understand what it meant. However, he saw the Miao soldier untie a large bag made of animal skin from his waist and threw it to him.</p>
<p>GUI Li reached out to catch it and sank. He saw a cork at the mouth of the bag. Then he saw that the Miao soldier reached to his mouth and made a drink. If GUI Li&rsquo;s heart had some understanding, he pulled out the cork and smelled it. It was a bag of strong wine.</p>
<p>With a bitter smile, he was not good at the wine, but now he is not in the mood. However, the Miao people all stare at him and think that it&rsquo;s not good to let others down. They nod and smile at the Miao soldier, put the wine bag to their mouth and drink it reluctantly.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, his brows wrinkled at the entrance. The wine made by the Miao people was very strong, and the flavor was even more like that of the southern frontier. He was suddenly surprised and felt uncomfortable.</p>
<p>His expression fell into the eyes of those Miao people. A dozen Miao people couldn&rsquo;t help laughing. They must have drunk the liquor made by the Miao people. It was not the first time that they saw the expression that they were not used to. There was a sense of pride in the laughter.</p>
<p>GUI Li was angry in his heart, but then he thought that these people were actually harmless, and that he was asking for help. How could he lose his temper, he had to smile bitterly. He was about to return the wine bag. The Miao soldier laughed and held out his hand to take it.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a white palm stretched out from the side, and took the large bag of wine from the ghost&rsquo;s hands. Everyone, including GUI Li, was stunned and saw the one who took the wine bag. Actually, it&rsquo;s Xiaobai standing beside her.</p>
<p>She picked up the wine bag and put it on her nose. She inhaled deeply. The smell of wine was so strong that it was so strong. But the woman didn&rsquo;t feel uncomfortable at all. Instead, she was intoxicated. Then she saw her hands a lift, put the wine bag to the mouth, and suddenly drank it.</p>
<p>Everyone was shocked, and the ghost was also surprised!</p>
<p>Xiaobai took a sip from the boss. Then he put down the wine bag, and his face gradually showed a satisfied look. After a long time, he let out a light breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good wine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is a group of Miao soldiers. Miao liquor in southern Xinjiang has always been ferocious. In this area, there has always been the strongest man, that is, the person with the largest amount of alcohol. In Miao people, women usually don&rsquo;t touch this kind of strong liquor that men only drink.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the seemingly soft woman in front of her eyes unexpectedly drank the liquor in a big way, and her reaction after drinking was just like the special expression of a senior wine ghost. All Miao men are good wine. At that time, he was moved and cheered.</p>
<p>On her white face, it seems that it is because of the strong liquor entering her throat that she is covered with a faint blush. However, her spirit suddenly vibrates. She holds the wine bag in her right hand and releases it with her left hand. She slaps the finger gently with the scallion finger to the group of Miao soldiers, making a thin &ldquo;pa&rdquo; sound.</p>
<p>There was another commotion in that group of Miao soldiers. They were surprised and funny. This gesture is clearly the gesture of inviting others to make a toast to each other among the Miao people in southern Xinjiang. This middle earth looking woman actually made an incomparable standard and looked at each other for a moment.</p>
<p>But more powerful. What made them stare straight is still behind.</p>
<p>I saw Xiaobai chuckle, eyes at the moment really soft, such as water general, a head, hair floating, wine bag to the mouth. Chuckled and gulped.</p>
<p>All the Miao people were shocked and turned pale. They only blamed Xiaobai in their hearts for doing this. However, in the eyes of all Miao people, this woman is almost the first strange woman in the world.</p>
<p>Miao liquor is extremely strong. Nowadays, looking at the whole Miao people, no man can drink it at one breath. Most of them are drunk to three-quarters. But now, seeing that the woman&rsquo;s throat was moving, she was actually drinking a lot. At that time, many Miao people and men were moved.</p>
<p>But, just now Xiaobai also made that extremely classic gesture!</p>
<p>After all, Miao people are upright, and when so many men face the challenge of a seemingly weak woman, it is impossible for them to flinch. I don&rsquo;t know who was the first one to shout. He threw the spear on the ground, untied the wine bag hanging on his waist, looked up and drank.</p>
<p>Miao people have a custom that every man has a wine bag around him. When he starts, it is like frying a pot. All the Miao people throw guns and drink wine one after another. The scene is really spectacular.</p>
<p>Only the little leader of the Miao people suddenly woke up and reached for the wine. Unexpectedly, he took it empty. Then he realized that the wine bag was already in Xiaobai&rsquo;s hands. Seeing that all the men around him were drinking, the head of the Miao people was flushed with anxiety, and there was a great danger that he would not drink at this time, which would leave him infamous forever.</p>
<p>As soon as his eyes turned, the head of the Miao people rushed to a Miao soldier near the river. He grabbed the wine bag from his hand and drank it to his mouth.</p>
<p>The soldier was very angry at the moment. The so-called shikesha wine could not be stopped. He would come up to grab the wine with a loud roar. Unexpectedly, the leader of the Miao people was on guard and kicked him suddenly. He kicked him into the river and splashed the big splash, which scared Xiao Hui who was playing on the bank.</p>
<p>After a moment of fighting, Yan Gulu, the soldier and the other soldiers scrambled to get out of the bank A drink will rise.</p>
<p>He was so stunned that he forgot the altar on the hillside for a moment. He saw a large group of Miao men on one side and a delicate woman on the other side. Both sides were crazy and drank hard. Although the scene was spectacular, it was really funny and made people sweat.</p>
<p>At the moment, the scene was so spectacular that it immediately attracted other Miao people around. In an instant, news was sent out. Only listening to the sharp voices of the Miao people, hula, a large number of people gathered around, which was at least three times more than that of the onlookers.</p>
<p>The vendor left the stall and the hunter threw away the prey. All the people in the room will come out. There is no barrier around here. There are three floors inside and three outside. It is really a sea of people.</p>
<p>From time to time, shouts and shrieks came from the crowd. I think it&rsquo;s mostly people&rsquo;s cheering voice when they are excited.</p>
<p>In the middle of the venue, it&rsquo;s a critical moment for both sides to fight for wine. It&rsquo;s hard for the Miao people to drink hard liquor, even if they&rsquo;re Miao soldiers who often drink alcohol. Now it&rsquo;s slowly beginning to fall.</p>
<p>Whenever a person falls down, the crowd makes a &ldquo;Hua&rdquo; sound, an uproar, but the color of excitement is full of people&rsquo;s faces.</p>
<p>After a while, more and more men of Miao nationality showed their faces in pain, their faces were red and their ears were red, and they could not help standing still, although they had to struggle to support them. But under the whirling of the earth, they had to fall to the ground.</p>
<p>PA, PA, PA!</p>
<p>All the Miao soldiers were not far away from each other in drinking capacity, so they poured down a large area. On the other side of the field, only three of them stood, barely supporting, including the little leader of the Miao soldier.</p>
<p>In contrast, Xiaobai&rsquo;s eyes are straight.</p>
<p>The little white eyes seemed to be closed, and the blush on her face gradually became thick, almost as if it was coming out of her white skin. She was so charming. And the eye wave is like water. Yingying as if to reveal the general, let people look at it will be intoxicated.</p>
<p>However, her beauty is so, but her drinking capacity is even more terrible. Until now, she has no sign of standing unsteadily. She is still drinking liquor in a big gulp.</p>
<p>The Miao people present included some women. All of them are people who know a lot about drinking. At a glance, they can see that this woman is not faking at all. They are really choosing this group of Miao men according to their drinking capacity. They are even more frightened by Xiaobai&rsquo;s peerless beauty, and they are shouting for them.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>There were two muffled noises, and two more fell down from the Miao soldier. At this moment, only the little head of the Miao soldier was struggling to support him. However, seeing his feet gradually falter, he obviously reached the limit.</p>
<p>Xiaobai&rsquo;s face is getting more and more red, and suddenly his body is crooked. The onlookers suddenly give out a cry. Xiaobai slowly puts down the wine bag and gives a breath. If he wants to drip water from his eyes, the wine will be more beautiful and beautiful. He still holds the wine bag in his right hand, but he waves the left hand to the crowd and says with a smile: &ldquo;aksi!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The crowd was suddenly in an uproar. Aksi means &ldquo;good wine&rdquo; in Miao language. This woman has a large amount of wine and looks more beautiful. She also calls out &ldquo;good wine&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>In an instant, the crowd burst into a very warm applause.</p>
<p>Xiaobai shook his head and seemed to be a bit drunk, and his body was also a little more staggering. He walked slowly to the ghost and leaned against his body, laughing at him.</p>
<p>He was dumb.</p>
<p>Xiaobai closed his eyes and gently shook his head for a moment. Then he laughed again and said, &ldquo;three hundred years! Three hundred years</p>
<p>Head up, hands up, drink!</p>
<p>That drinking demeanor, actually is also peerless Qing Yan Rou Mei!</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The last Miao man, the leader, finally fell to the ground. Although he was very unwilling, he was as red as a little gray buttocks. He was already powerless. After a moment, he was unconscious and fell to the ground and fell asleep. Someone nearby ran to pick up his wine bag to check. There was also a small half bag of liquor. He could not help but change color for it. He announced to the surrounding crowd loudly that the crowd was in uproar. Obviously, this is an incredible record.</p>
<p>However, people have not forgotten that there is still an incredible woman who is still drinking.</p>
<p>Little white face, at the moment, like a ruby, even her white neck and even exposed a little bit of chest skin, actually also had a light red.</p>
<p>Look at her appearance, at the moment, it seems that she is also standing unsteadily, but she leans against the body, is still drinking.</p>
<p>In the crowd, now gradually quiet down, people&rsquo;s facial expression, has gradually changed from excitement to admiration.</p>
<p>Finally, Xiaobai drinks the last gulp of liquor and takes away the wine bag. Her eyes seem to be unable to open. Then she smiles with a red face and a lazy expression. With a wave of her hand, she throws the big wine bag out.</p>
<p>Immediately someone came to pick up the wine bag for inspection, and then found that the wine bag was empty!</p>
<p>A moment later, the man announced in a loud voice to the crowd that was staring at him. The crowd was silent for a long time, and suddenly there was a scream that was shocking the sky.</p>
<p>In the noise, the ghost is like a needle on a needle. Xiao Bai ruo&rsquo;s boneless body leans on his body. His face is white and red. His eyes are half open and half closed. His eyes are soft as water. He stares at him closely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you ok?&rdquo; After holding on for a long time, he murmured this sentence.</p>
<p>Xiaobai reached out and grabbed his clothes. He felt like he was drunk. His white teeth bit his lower lip, and his breath was gradually heavy. However, his eyes were soft and his mouth was smiling, but he did not change at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&hellip;&rdquo; Xiaobai&rsquo;s voice, as if to drip water to the general soft, in the GUI Li ear, gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you like me (to be continued. )</p>
