      <p>At this time, the young girl also saw Zhang Xiaofan and Lu Xueqi, who were still unconscious beside him. Obviously, she didn&rsquo;t expect that there were still living people under the lifeless abyss. When her face changed, she was surprised.</p>
<p>Then, she saw Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s face clearly, stupefied for a while, a trace of surprise flitted across her face, and then she smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true that we don&rsquo;t meet each other in life!&rdquo; She came gracefully in the dark like a beautiful and blooming lily.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan stands up and stands in front of Lu Xueqi intentionally or unintentionally. After all, it&rsquo;s not ordinary people who come to the lifeless abyss haunted by ghosts and monsters.</p>
<p>When the girl approached, Zhang Xiaofan could see clearly that there was a white flower in her right green jade finger, which could emit a light white light, illuminating the land near the girl, and he did not know what kind of alien it was.</p>
<p>However, Zhang Xiaofan has no time to care about the flower. Although he is still wary of this strange woman, he feels more close to her at once when he sees her in the dark and lonely abyss.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good milk.&rdquo; Zhang Xiaofan wanted to say some polite greetings, but only these two words were left in his mouth.</p>
<p>The girl glanced at him and said with a smile, &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t this young Xia Zhang Xiaofan from Qingyun Mountain? Why do you come to this place full of ghosts? This is not where you should be. &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was stunned and said, &ldquo;how does milk know that I am under Qingyun gate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl did not answer with a smile.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan frowned. He only thought that the girl was not simple. He was looking for something to think about. But he heard the girl chuckle and said, &ldquo;excuse me, young Xia Zhang, how long have you been here? Have you found the blood hole?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan stayed for a while and said, &ldquo;what kind of blood hole?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young girl snorted, and her smile faded, but she still said calmly, &ldquo;young Xia Zhang is so good at pretending to be confused, you so-called righteous people. If it wasn&rsquo;t for the things in the blood dripping hole, how could it come to this dark and dirty place? &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan is confused by what she said, but she has vaguely understood that there is a blood dripping hole in the hole, afraid of something important. But before going down the mountain, he had never heard from Shifu or the headmaster or the uncle. But what he thought at the moment was not these, but he heard the meaning of the girl&rsquo;s words and said in a deep voice, &ldquo;milk says we are honest and hypocritical. Who is the milk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl was dressed in green.</p>
<p>With her jade like hand, the flower between her fingers drew an arc in the air. The white light left a trace in the air. It seemed that she also remembered the darkness. After a long time, it dissipated slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I not the Witch of the demon sect that you abhor?&rdquo; She smiled and smiled.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s heart sank, and suddenly he felt lost, but the thought just flashed by, leaving no trace, and then he hummed. Be alert.</p>
<p>Since he entered the first gate of Qingyun Mountain, he listened to the teachings of all the senior teachers and elder martial brothers on how to teach the demons how to do harm to the world. In the rules of Qingyun gate, it is strictly forbidden to make friends with the demons. They are enemies of life and death, and they can&rsquo;t live together.</p>
<p>However, the girl didn&rsquo;t seem to have the intention of fighting at once. Instead, she took a look behind Zhang Xiaofan and said with a smile, &ldquo;does this elder sister seem to wake up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan looked back and saw Lu Xueqi turning over. The corner of the mouth moved twice, and slowly opened his eyes. Zhang Xiaofan was very happy and returned to his body and said, &ldquo;the milk is awake!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, Lu Xueqi suddenly appeared frightened and struggled: &ldquo;be careful&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan hasn&rsquo;t responded yet. I just felt that there was a strange fragrance around me, and a white flower appeared in front of me.</p>
<p>In the dark, under the abyss of the dead, where will there be any flowers? Zhang Xiaofan took a step back in horror. But saw that the flower had no wind and was automatic, as if in the middle of the air to show a little smile to him, nodded, in an instant, a flower was split, petals were white and lovely, but the edge flashed a faint green light, flying to him.</p>
<p>Even if you don&rsquo;t know the identity of the young girl&rsquo;s demon sect, you can see that the strange flower is not right. Zhang Xiaofan is suddenly attacked. He is in a hurry. He takes a few steps back. In the rush, he raises the fire stick in front of him. Most of the petals that come from the quick shooting come into contact with the dark blue light of the fire stick, and most of them are blocked, but some of them are dangerous and almost hurt Zhang Xiaofan.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was shocked. He swore that these demons were treacherous and deceitful. What the Shifu nuns and senior brothers said was a wise saying, not a bad word. But at the moment, he glanced at the girl&rsquo;s figure, but he flew to Lu Xueqi.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was shocked. Seeing Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s serious injury, he had little power to return. He was pulled away again. He quickly waved the fire stick to sacrifice and rushed to the girl in green.</p>
<p>Hearing the wind, the girl in green smiled calmly. Her right hand met her in the middle of the air. In a moment, all the petals flew back like lightning. They gathered on the flower bud. The little flower with light white light in her fingers welcomed her. The white light and the dark blue light of the firecracker touched each other. They stood in the middle of the air for a moment. It seemed that they could not win. They flew back to each other Go.</p>
<p>In the dark, there was a faint cry of surprise.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of this opportunity, Zhang Xiaofan hurriedly returns to Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s side and stops in front of her, so as not to let the strange and treacherous Witch of the demon sect do another trick.</p>
<p>However, the &ldquo;strange and treacherous&rdquo; fairy stopped suddenly at the moment and stopped moving forward. Zhang Xiaofan was allowed to return to Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s side and was shocked to see Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>Just then, she thought that Zhang Xiaofan could be easily controlled by the &ldquo;sad&rdquo; flower in her hand. Unexpectedly, when the &ldquo;sad&rdquo; flower and the fire stick were in the air, they could pass on the strange fragrance through the people&rsquo;s heart, which made her collapse immediately, but it was back, and there was a hint of backfire, which surprised her.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan stood in front of Lu Xueqi, helped her to stand up and asked in a low voice, &ldquo;is milk OK! Elder martial sister Lu</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi shakes her head slightly. Zhang Xiaofan is relieved and turns to hate the tunnel: &ldquo;shameless demon, only sneaking attack!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The surprise in the girl&rsquo;s eyes disappeared immediately. Instead of the light anger, she snorted and said, &ldquo;OK, I&rsquo;ll show you the power of the demon later!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When she spoke, she had to act. Zhang Xiaofan was on the alert, but she cried bitterly. Lu Xueqi leaned on him at the moment, weak and obviously hurt very badly. Most of the poisons are not clear, but the Witch of the demon sect is strange and unpredictable. I&rsquo;m afraid I can&rsquo;t care about elder martial sister Lu.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a pity that things are often unsatisfactory. Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s mind is in a whirl here. But all of a sudden, things are getting worse.</p>
<p>In the dark, there was a little light, which was different from the girl in green, though it was light. It&rsquo;s dark, and in the dark it&rsquo;s almost like black light. In the light, a quiet figure came out and stopped beside the girl in green. She was a tall girl in black with a veil on her face. It was her companion in the mountain and sea garden that day.</p>
<p>Then, in Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s astonished eyes, the dark lights up one after another.</p>
<p>There were about five more people, dressed in yellow, who were the attendants of the young girl in the mountain and sea garden that day. At the moment, they all arrived here.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan felt his throat dry. He could not help but feel cold under the eyes of many people. At this time, he suddenly heard Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s slight and powerless words: &ldquo;go away, these people are not under you and me, and can&rsquo;t fight against you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan turned around and saw the pale and beautiful face beside him. There was no fear on the face, as if it was just saying the most normal thing. Zhang Xiaofan stayed for a while, shook his head, and tightened his lips. Once again, turn around and look at the mysterious people in the demon sect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be careful, Biyao,&rdquo; said the masked woman, looking at the two men in front of her. Finally, her eyes fell on Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s fire stick and whispered, &ldquo;that black stick is strange.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Baguio. That is to say, the girl in Green said, &ldquo;aunt you, what does the milk see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The masked woman she called aunt you could not see her expression, but she could hear a bit of confusion from her words: &ldquo;it seems that the ferocity just now was so similar, but how could the people in the right way have this thing, and they would not control the bead, and this, this is a short stick, what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to see how powerful this thing is!&rdquo; said Biyao with a snort She said that she took a step forward, and then the man in yellow behind her also walked forward at the same time. When Zhang Xiaofan saw it wrong, he had the heart to fight against the enemy, but there was too much difference between us and the enemy, so he had to help Lu Xueqi back.</p>
<p>The girl in black looks very ghostly. The whole person is floating straight forward in the dark. She is just like a ghost beside Bagao. She says in a voice that only the two of them can hear: &ldquo;the short stick in the young man&rsquo;s hand is very fierce. Does the milk feel it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biyao looks at Zhang Xiaofan, who is on the alert, and nods.</p>
<p>The masked woman paused for a moment and said, &ldquo;although it is true, I feel that the ferocity of this short stick has not been fully released. It seems that it has been suppressed by something. In my opinion, most of this short stick has something to do with our holy religion. The identity of this young man is very suspicious. You should think twice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biyao frowned and said, &ldquo;aunt you, what does milk say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The voice of the masked woman turned to bland and said, &ldquo;just capture it. Take it back to the milk father and show it to him. The patriarch is wise enough to know the world, so he will know it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After thinking about it, Biyao said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s OK.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the conversation, they didn&rsquo;t stop at their feet and pushed forward. Without the consent of the two of them, the people in yellow next to them wouldn&rsquo;t do anything. As soon as they stepped in and stepped out of the conversation, they walked out for a while.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan holds Lu Xueqi in a more and more tense mood, but gradually hears the sound of water waves. It seems that he is walking back to the beginning of the bay.</p>
<p>After a pause, Biyao turned to the masked woman and said, &ldquo;aunt you, is this the merciless sea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The masked woman was silent for a while, but sighed in a low voice, saying: &ldquo;infatuation is only for the merciless suffering! Yes, this is the most mysterious and merciless sea among the five seas. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; It seems that because of her youth, Biyao didn&rsquo;t care about the bitter and astringent meaning in the words of the masked woman she called Youyi. She was very excited. She said: &ldquo;I heard from my father since childhood that the merciless sea is deep in the ground, and it&rsquo;s the sea of nine seclusions. Moreover, he said that the blood hole under the dead soul abyss is on the merciless sea. It seems that we found it three days later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the masked woman fell into silence.</p>
<p>Biyao looked at her strangely, and then she turned away and said, &ldquo;OK, now I&rsquo;ll catch you first, and then I&rsquo;ll find the blood hole!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a wave of her hand, the five men in yellow set foot together and prepared to start. Behind Zhang Xiaofan is the boundless and merciless sea in the dark. In front of him is surrounded by the people of these demon sects. There is no way to go. There is no way to go back. He is in the Jedi.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi felt the merciless sea behind her, and there was a gust of cold wind. Cold into the heart, and his body is weak, even faintly have the feeling of dizziness and nausea, just afraid that the remaining poison is not clear.</p>
<p>How intelligent she is. Do not want to know this situation, Zhang Xiaofan to take care of her can only be two people died together.</p>
<p>She turned her head and looked at Zhang Xiaofan. At the moment, the young man seemed to be a little nervous and tense. Even her hands were strained. Even in his eyes, there was a longing for life and a fear of death.</p>
<p>Just, he clearly did not, even a trace of retreat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Younger martial brother Zhang.&rdquo; She called softly. Zhang Xiaofan heard it and moved his shoulder. It seemed that he was about to turn around, but somehow. But I didn&rsquo;t look back at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elder martial sister Lu, on the platform, even the milk just saved me and protected me. I&rsquo;m not going to leave.&rdquo; Zhang Xiaofan was in a high mood. He was trying to say something heroic, but when he said it to his mouth, it seemed that he lost sight of it. At last, he had to say &ldquo;don&rsquo;t leave&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi stopped talking.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan suddenly felt uneasy. Did he bump into her in his words? I don&rsquo;t know why, since I saw Lu Xueqi. He was afraid of the cold woman.</p>
<p>The cold wind came from the merciless sea, blowing several long hair of the silent woman behind him, and gently skimmed his neck and cheek.</p>
<p>The waves of the merciless sea seemed to surge suddenly.</p>
<p>Deep in the dark. It&rsquo;s like a sigh. The wind is passing by. It&rsquo;s like a ferocious smile on the merciless sea, sneering at people in the world.</p>
<p>Baguio smiled and went up surrounded by five people in yellow.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan steps back, but feels cold under his feet. I stepped into the icy sea.</p>
<p>At this time, gradually turbulent and merciless sea, suddenly, a huge wave hit high, the sound of the sea waves was deafening, it was several feet high in the past, the wind was blowing, the people on the shore were all discolored, almost all could not stand steadily.</p>
<p>Standing at the end of the masked woman Huoran changes color, shouting: &ldquo;Baguio, go back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biyao was shocked. Knowing that she was well-informed and respected by her father, she retreated without much thought.</p>
<p>Her figure moved, and five people in yellow followed her back. Only Zhang Xiaofan and Lu Xueqi, who were standing near the sea, were caught off guard. When they were hit by the huge wave, they were wet all over, but the cold entering the bone marrow was really painful.</p>
<p>Then they looked at the sea, which had changed dramatically, and saw two huge lights shining with green light slowly in a dark sea. But when they looked at the past, the lights were really strange. Instead of making ordinary circles, they were thin and long from the top to the bottom, especially in the middle, there were two tiny dark cracks, cold and fierce.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s it, it&rsquo;s it.&rdquo; The masked woman shivered. &ldquo;The beast is not dead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biyao said: &ldquo;beast? Aunt you, what is this? &quot;</p>
<p>The masked woman looked at the two circles of light that were getting closer to the coast in the stormy and merciless sea, and her voice was slightly frightened, saying, &ldquo;this is the black water snake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The big shock of Baguio was unbelievable. He said, &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t the monster have been killed by the beast, the yellow bird, in the Western swamp thousands of years ago?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The masked woman quickly said: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s said that it&rsquo;s so, but today it appears here. I don&rsquo;t know luouc Baguio. This black water snake is an ancient Warcraft. It&rsquo;s fierce and unmatched. It can&rsquo;t be eliminated by its natural enemy, the yellow bird. Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After two steps back, Biyao suddenly turned to her head and said, &ldquo;but that boy</p>
<p>The masked woman shook her head and said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care about that much. Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biyao is still hesitating, but Zhang Xiaofan and Lu Xueqi, who stand by the sea and are drenched by the waves, almost hold their breath in a blink of an eye.</p>
<p>When they got close, they could see that the two huge lights, which were almost two people high, were a pair of huge eyes. It&rsquo;s said that since entering the wanbat grottoes, Zhang Xiaofan has constantly seen strange and huge eyes, from the red devil&rsquo;s eyes of the eldest brother to the giant eyes of the pig headed monster and beast, but no matter which pair is more like mustard than the one in front of him.</p>
<p>The sea wind is strong and strong, but it doesn&rsquo;t bring a little salty taste, but the overwhelming fishy smell, which directly chokes people&rsquo;s nose.</p>
<p>A huge black snake slowly emerged in front of them. Its lower body is coiled, and its body is immersed in the sea water. The people are less than three parts of the size of the huge snake. However, the black water black snake stands on the upper body and head of the snake, which is tens of feet high from the ground and emits the faint green eyes. At the moment, they are looking down from above and see the people who are like ants to it.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan never knew that there were such huge creatures in the world. He even thought that the holy water unicorn on the top of Qingyun Mountain Tongtian peak was the biggest spirit beast in the world. But compared with the black water snake, the water unicorn is almost the same size as the dog.</p>
<p>Needless to say, it was Lu Xueqi beside him, even Biyao of the demon sect, who had never seen such a huge beast. For a while, he was stunned in the local area and could not speak.</p>
<p>Note 1: &ldquo;Shanhaijing great wasteland Nanjing&rdquo;: in the south of Heishui, there are Xuan snakes and Shi Zhu. There are Wushan people and yellow birds in the West. Imperial medicine, bazhai. The yellow bird is in Wushan. It is in charge of the black snake.</p>
<p>Note: in the chapter of gods, demons, monsters and beasts, the black water Xuan Snake: the giant snake has a black body, white belly, green eyes, and a body of more than four Zhangs thick and more than one hundred Zhangs long. He lived for thousands of years and lived in the Western Everglades. It is said that he lives in the sea. (to be continued. )</p>
