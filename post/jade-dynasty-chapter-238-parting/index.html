      <p>At the foot of Qingyun Mountain, outside Heyang City, there is an ancient Wilderness Road.</p>
<p>Monday immortals still hold that piece of fairy pointing the way in the wind, bamboo pole cloth curtain, swaggering along the ancient road, with him walking side by side is the ghost, and behind them are the small ring and wild dog Taoist.</p>
<p>The four of them walked slowly away from the Heyang city behind him. Xiaohuan looked at the ghost&rsquo;s back. He looked at his face with a strange expression. After a few words, he could not help it. He took a few steps to Gui Li and pulled his sleeve.</p>
<p>Xiao Hui, the monkey sitting on the ghost&rsquo;s shoulder, turned around with a squeak and grinned at Xiaohuan. Somehow, Xiaohuan turned a little red under the eyes of the monkey. After a while, he looked at him. It was still lonely, but it was much better than the scene when they met in Heyang City.</p>
<p>Looking at the small ring, the ghost sharp face also showed a trace of gentle smile, way: &ldquo;what matter?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Xiaohuan just summoned up the courage, in front of the man&rsquo;s light smile suddenly disappeared, stuttering for a moment, next to the Monday immortal in the eyes, repeatedly shaking his head, as for the dog Taoist standing behind, it seems that the face is not good-looking. &ldquo;Cheechezhi&rdquo; this slightly embarrassed, it is monkey Xiaohui who laughs the loudest, and Xiaohuan&rsquo;s face is redder and stares fiercely It is only a glance, Xiaohui naturally does not put the little girl&rsquo;s eyes in the eye, on the contrary, he has a kind of learning, three eyes together open up, reverse small ring stare.</p>
<p>Xiao Huan exclaimed and stepped back. As the saying goes, two fists are hard to beat four hands. It seems that eyes are the same. Even if you are facing a monkey, as long as the monkey has one more eye than you, most of you can&rsquo;t stare at it.</p>
<p>Small ash big music, jumped up, in the Guili shoulder almost roll, flip between, but also to small ring tongue to make a face, small ring spat at the gray monkey, but so. She coughed, but she didn&rsquo;t face up to the ghost, and her eyes drifted to and fro. Whispered, &ldquo;you, where are you going to go in the future?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The wild dog Taoist standing in the capital was even more ugly.</p>
<p>GUI Li was slightly stunned. He didn&rsquo;t answer immediately. After a moment, he looked back at Zhou Xian, nodded and said, &ldquo;yes. I just want to ask you, what are your future plans.</p>
<p>After a moment&rsquo;s silence, he said, &ldquo;to be honest, I don&rsquo;t know. Thanks to my predecessors&rsquo; guidance, although I feel a little sad about the passing of the master&rsquo;s wife, I can see that I can&rsquo;t be filial to them as early as possible.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Monday fairy sighed: &ldquo;you say so, it is not really open heart, but people are not vegetation. Sometimes, even if you know the truth, you can&rsquo;t help yourself. You can&rsquo;t blame you. However, the dead are gone, and you don&rsquo;t have to be too sad. Otherwise, your master and mother will have a spirit in heaven, and you won&rsquo;t. You&rsquo;d better think about the future. &ldquo;.</p>
<p>The encouragement nodded, pondered for a moment, and the blank color on his face flashed, with a slightly bitter meaning: &ldquo;I have been for ten years. Running away, is just to save a person, but a few opportunities, but it is a failure. At the moment, the sky is vast, but I really have nothing to do.</p>
<p>Zhou Yixian&rsquo;s face changed slightly, and his eyes turned slightly to the small ring. He seemed to have hesitated. Then he said faintly: &ldquo;I have heard of your experience. About the girl of the green jade.</p>
<p>The ghostly body a shock, quickly turned over the body, the way: &ldquo;master, do you have any method?&rdquo; excited, the voice seems to tremble.</p>
<p>Standing on one side of the small ring some surprise, to see Monday fairy, but only Monday fairy gently coughed two voices: &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do anything about it.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Xiaohuan can&rsquo;t help but ask the ghost: &ldquo;what&rsquo;s wrong with your girl, Biyao?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>He was silent and did not wait for him to speak. Zhou Xianxian glared at Xiaohuan and said in a sharp voice, &ldquo;what do you know about children? Don&rsquo;t interrupt.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Xiaohuan was surprised. On Monday, Xianping said that she was not respected by the old man. Although she often joked with her and quarreled with her, she was very rare. She was stunned for a moment.</p>
<p>The ghost heaved a long sigh, full of Xiao Suo&rsquo;s meaning.</p>
<p>A complex look flashed in the eyes of the immortal on Monday, and suddenly waved to the ghost and said, &ldquo;come to the side and I have something to say to you.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>With that, he left Xiaohuan and the wild dog Taoist, and went to the far side of the ancient road. Xiaohuan looked lonely and followed him slowly. Xiaohuan came back to his mind, but he saw that they were already standing in the distance. He saw that Monday immortal frowned and whispered something to Gui Li. With the words of Monday immortal, his facial expression gradually changed. First, he was surprised, then he was in a daze He had a hope, but obviously this hope was not very great. His expression gradually turned to low. On the contrary, the immortal kept talking all the time on Monday. It seemed that the elder was teaching the younger generation with great care.</p>
<p>Small ring pouted up, suddenly a nameless fire in his heart, and kicked the stone under his feet. The stone was suddenly not up. It swept an arc in the air, but hit the foot of the wild dog Taoist.</p>
<p>The wild dog Taoist priest was in a daze. He didn&rsquo;t pay attention to the stone. He was shocked and frowned.</p>
<p>Small ring looked in the past, but also with some embarrassed to get up, went to the soft voice: &ldquo;Taoist, are you ok?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Under her gaze, the wild dog Taoist immediately shook his head and whispered, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s OK, I&rsquo;m fine.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Xiaohuan nodded, and then her eyes fell on the ghost in the distance. Her eyes moved, several thoughts and many expressions appeared on her face one by one.</p>
<p>The wild dog Taoist was watching the little ring and hanging his head in silence.</p>
<p>Suddenly, he only heard the voice of Xiao Huan and said, &ldquo;by the way, Taoist priest, I want to ask you something.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The wild dog Taoist raised his head and said, &ldquo;what?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Xiaohuan frowned slightly, and said, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter with his Biyao girl? Why does it look like big brother GUI Li is so tricky.</p>
<p>Taoist wild dog hesitated for a moment. To be honest, he was not the core figure in the ghost King&rsquo;s clan. He heard about the situation of Biyao. However, he knew the cause of the incident. However, it was a long story. He did not know where to start for a moment. Just as he pondered, he said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a long story. I heard it was ten years ago.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>At this point, he suddenly stopped. Xiao Huan&rsquo;s reaction was the same as that of him. He was a little surprised. He turned around and saw a pale purple light falling from the sky above the ancient road behind them. Gently fall, such as duckweed slowly fall, a few turn around, impressively is gold bottle son that charming infinite face son.</p>
<p>Xiaohuan is surprised at first, then happy.</p>
<p>A light cry: &ldquo;sister pinger&rdquo; said that she ran to Xiaohuan. When she saw Xiaohuan, she was also smiling. She took Xiaohuan&rsquo;s hand and looked at her carefully. She said with a smile, &ldquo;dear sister, every time I see you, I feel that you are more and more beautiful. It&rsquo;s like a day. I don&rsquo;t know how many men I&rsquo;ve lost.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Small ring unexpectedly gold bottle son meet is this sentence, although she knew this elder sister is not what three obedience four virtues of the dignified lady, but smell speech also pink face crimson. &ldquo;What fascinated men, really, not easy to meet once, you laugh at others.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Jin pinger&rsquo;s eyes were full of smile. She stretched out her hand and gently twisted it on her broken face. She said with a smile, &ldquo;little girl, even I&rsquo;m going to be charmed by you. You&rsquo;re not honest.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Xiao Huan&rsquo;s face became more and more red. However, her relationship with Jin Ping&rsquo;er was excellent. It was rare to see her last time. It was really reluctant to let go, so he took the Golden Vase&rsquo;s hand and asked questions, but from time to time he secretly glanced at the ghost.</p>
<p>GUI Li and Zhou Xian naturally saw the Golden Vase&rsquo;s arrival. They both didn&rsquo;t expect that they would suddenly meet with it at this time, with the spirit of the Tao. Naturally, he discovered the whereabouts of jinpinger earlier than Xiaohuan and daoren dingou. He even knew that jinpinger had fallen from the direction of Heyang city behind them, and there seemed to be another trace of spiritual power in the direction of Heyang city in the distance. However, he could not see it clearly when it was too far away.</p>
<p>However, those who can be together with Jin Ping&rsquo;er will not be any famous people. Naturally, it is the people of the demon cult. After a moment of thinking about this, the ghost has no idea to explore. Instead, the Golden Vase son and Xiao Huan smile and say for a while, but the boat that pulls the middle small ring comes to them together. &ldquo;Young master, are you all right?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Gold bottle son&rsquo;s voice also seems to have some soft and charming meaning. It makes people&rsquo;s bones crisp. Xiaohuan, standing beside her, secretly raises her eyes and looks at the ghost. It only looks like the fox sound doesn&rsquo;t work for him. Somehow, Xiao Huan&rsquo;s mouth shows a little smile.</p>
<p>Since Jin Ping&rsquo;er came to say hello, he nodded his head slightly and said, &ldquo;what a coincidence.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Jin pinger smiles and says, &ldquo;farewell to Nanjiang. We haven&rsquo;t seen you for a long time.&rdquo; she said half of the time, suddenly, out of the corner of her eyes, she saw a three eyed monkey named Xiaohui, who was sitting on the ghostly shoulder. When she was in southern Xinjiang, Ke was teased by this monkey. At that time, her face sank, but Xiaohui didn&rsquo;t seem to be afraid at all. Looking at the expression of jinpinger, it was higher and higher He grinned at the Golden Vase, which was provocative.</p>
<p>Jinpinger was confused. She woke up and scolded herself. How could she be so indecisive to a monkey, she glared at Xiao Hui fiercely, moved her eyes, and ignored her eyes. Her smile reappeared on her face and said to the ghost, &ldquo;in a word, when you left the little girl alone, you didn&rsquo;t know where I was. It&rsquo;s really cruel.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t leave you behind, I&rsquo;m afraid I can&rsquo;t get out of the 100000 mountains.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Jin Ping&rsquo;er said &ldquo;ah&rdquo; and laughed behind his lips. Obviously, he didn&rsquo;t care about the prickles in the sharp words. He said, &ldquo;you can really make fun of him.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>GUI Li took a deep look at her and said, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s beyond my expectation that you can come out of the ancient magic cave.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Golden Vase son&rsquo;s eyes flashed and said with a smile, &ldquo;why, don&rsquo;t you want me to come out?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>With a faint smile, he did not nod or shake his head. He only turned to Monday and said, &ldquo;master, you and I are active. We have seen each other several times in the past ten years. As for what you said to me just now, no matter whether it is possible or not, I will always try it,&rdquo; which is better than no hope. &ldquo;.</p>
<p>Monday fairy nodded and said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s good that you know this. It&rsquo;s not common sense, and no one has tried it. It&rsquo;s just what I heard by chance when I traveled all over the world. You should be straight for yourself.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>GUI Li made a gift to the immortal on Monday. In this case, I&rsquo;ll go. I&rsquo;ll see you in the future.</p>
<p>Say body line move, see to be about to leave, suddenly have the side spread a cry: &ldquo;wait, you wait!&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Ghost Li a Zheng, turn to look at small ring, see small ring standing beside gold bottle son, hesitant. The desire stopped. Looking in his eyes, Zhou Xian suddenly shook his head, sighed, and turned away. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter. Little ring? &quot; GUI Li seemed to feel something, and his face softened down. He asked in a soft voice.</p>
<p>The little ring&rsquo;s lips trembled slightly, as if to say something, but in the end nothing was said.</p>
<p>The Golden Vase stood aside and took her hand.</p>
<p>At the moment, she frowned slightly, and the little white and delicate hand trembled in her palm. She turned her head and looked at the little ring. She saw that the little girl stopped crying, but after half a sound, the atmosphere was somewhat embarrassed, but she still did not speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, it&rsquo;s a little sigh to pull a small bottle of gold behind him.</p>
<p>He was silent for a moment, and his eyes drifted past the slender figure that was blocked by the body of the Golden Vase son. His eyes seemed to have some warmth. But his voice turned cold, light way: &ldquo;I live everywhere, where there is a fixed place!&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The Golden Vase son said again, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a man who lives all over the world. It&rsquo;s a man&rsquo;s ambition. But can you tell me, young master, do you have any worries in mind?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Xiao Huan&rsquo;s body seemed to be suddenly stiff for a moment, but he didn&rsquo;t move. He was still hiding behind the Golden Vase. However, the gold bottle Er felt the tension. The voice in front of him seemed to be colder. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>With that, he took a deep look at the suddenly rigid body, and the corners of his mouth moved, but after a while he covered up the strange look. He turned and walked away for a few steps, pausing for a moment, but he didn&rsquo;t look back. After a while, he turned into a gray light and went straight to the sky.</p>
<p>Xifeng ancient road. The wilderness is silent.</p>
<p>The atmosphere here was very dull for a moment. Xiao Huan didn&rsquo;t speak and didn&rsquo;t come out from behind the Golden Vase. However, the hand holding the golden vase&rsquo;er seemed to fall into the flesh.</p>
<p>The wild dog Taoist looked ugly. He took a step and wanted to say something, but he didn&rsquo;t say it. Finally, Monday immortal coughed and came forward and said with a dry smile, &ldquo;Xiaohuan, this fate and that fate are predestined. We should be more open-minded.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Before the words were finished, Jin pinger suddenly raised her eyebrows and glared at the Taoist priest Zhouxian and wild dog. Both of them felt that their eyes were burned. They could not help but step back. Jin pinger snorted and said with a cold face, &ldquo;you are not good things. Go away.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Monday fairy and wild dog Taoist looked at each other.</p>
<p>Jin pinger turns around and holds Xiaohuan in her arms. Xiaohuan finally can&rsquo;t bear it. &ldquo;Wow!&rdquo; she cried. She patted her back gently and said in a soft voice, &ldquo;silly child, what is there to cry about? I tell you, men in the world are not good things.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, the little ring cried, &ldquo;no, he&rsquo;s not, he&rsquo;s a good man.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Jinpinger was angry and funny, and said, &ldquo;yes, yes, he is a good man. Look at you, and your eyes are red after a while.&rdquo; she carefully wiped Xiaohuan&rsquo;s tears.</p>
<p>Next to Monday fairy shook his head and murmured: &ldquo;good fellow, I have raised her for decades. In the end, people say that I am not a good thing, and no one gives me a word, saying that others are good people. It&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The words did not finish, the gold bottle son seems to want to kill the eyes swept over, Monday fairy words immediately swallow back to the stomach.</p>
<p>At night, because Xiaohuan was in a bad mood, they did not know how far they had traveled. Originally, jinpinger also passed by here. By chance, she found that Xiaohuan and others came down here to meet each other. Originally, she thought that she would have to go on her way when she said something. However, she was worried that Xiaohuan was in a bad mood and was delayed.</p>
<p>However, in the evening, after several enlightenments and teasing from jinpinger, Xiaohuan&rsquo;s face finally shows a smile. Jinpinger whispers to him secretly, and doesn&rsquo;t know what to say. In the eyes of daoren daoren, the amazing and charming jinpinger makes Xiaohuan&rsquo;s face red and white for a while, but it may not be a good thing.</p>
<p>After saying this for a while, Jin pinger stood up, stretched out, and said, &ldquo;OK, I should go too.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It seemed that she had expected that the Golden Vase would leave. There was no surprise on the little ring, but it was obvious that she could not give up. Holding the hand of the Golden Vase, she whispered, &ldquo;sister, when can we see you again?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Golden Vase son smile slightly, way: &ldquo;don&rsquo;t worry, the world is big, our sisters are destined to meet each other.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Small ring &ldquo;en&rdquo; a, nodded, way: &ldquo;then I give you a ride.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said the Golden Vase. She took her hand and went outside. The Taoist priest Zhouxian and wild dog were eager for the woman to leave quickly, and did not stop her at the moment.</p>
<p>After walking for a distance, the two girls said something again, and the Golden Vase said with a smile: &ldquo;OK, send it here, or your grandfather should scold me again.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Xiaohuan nodded, suddenly seemed to remember something, hesitated for a moment, and said: &ldquo;sister, I remember that you seem to be in the same sect with him?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The golden vase&rsquo;er was stunned and said, &ldquo;yes, what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Xiaohuan whispered, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter with that girl, can you tell me?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Jin Ping&rsquo;er sighed and said, &ldquo;sister, I didn&rsquo;t mean to say you. Although that man is a little different, it&rsquo;s my sister. I also look at him differently. It&rsquo;s different from other men, but I&rsquo;d like to advise you. Forget it. His life has been rough. If you go up again, you&rsquo;ll just suffer yourself.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Xiao Huan shook his head and said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think much about what to do. I just want to know more about him.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Jin pinger shakes her head slightly, sighs, ponders for a moment, and then tells the past simply like a little ring. Xiao Huan listens and listens, but her facial expression gradually becomes ugly. Especially when she hears that at last, the soul of Biyao is confined in the joyous bell and wanders around the world in order to find a way to release her soul, her face almost turns black.</p>
<p>Jin pinger naturally noticed the change of Xiao Huan&rsquo;s face, but she also thought she was a girl. She said softly, &ldquo;OK, that&rsquo;s about it. Sister, listen to her sister&rsquo;s words. Don&rsquo;t take these things into consideration. You still have a long way to go in the future.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Xiaohuan seems to be absent-minded and ugly. He nods at the Golden Vase and says, &ldquo;I know.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Then she walked away quickly and went back to the Golden Vase. After a short time, there was a quarrel in the distance. It seemed that Xiaohuan and Zhouxian had a quarrel again.</p>
<p>Jinpinger couldn&rsquo;t help laughing. Since she was able to quarrel, she must be in a better spirit. After all, she was young. She shook her head and seemed to feel that she was getting old. But soon, this apparently damned idea was kicked out of her mind.</p>

<p>Cangsong Taoist slowly turned around and said, &ldquo;you have been delayed for a long time.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The Gold Vase son face does not change, smile way: &ldquo;anyway, the Lord also told us to act carefully, don&rsquo;t need to rush for success, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; She had a charming smile, which was even more subtle. She said with a soft smile, &ldquo;Taoist priest, do you have a state of mind that you can&rsquo;t wait to return to your hometown for the Qingyun Mountain in front of you?&rdquo; Taoist Cangsong snorted coldly. He didn&rsquo;t speak. He just turned around and looked at the distance. The Golden Vase Er, with a smile, went to his side and looked along with his eyes.</p>
<p>In the distance, the towering Qingyun Mountain is looming in the mist. (to be continued. )</p>
