      <p>The darkness is boundless, only the sound of the wind is more and more bleak. The Lich walked in the dark corridor of the ancient cave, just like a ghost walking towards the nine secluded places.</p>
<p>The older the cave is, the wider it becomes, but the darkness around it grows deeper. Walking on this cold and terrible Road, the Lich can even close its eyes and walk forward.</p>
<p>For many years, he wandered alone here, and now, he finally wants to change his own destiny.</p>
<p>Perhaps, and the fate of countless people in the world.</p>
<p>The wind roars in front of him!</p>
<p>A faint light suddenly lit up in front of him. Though the light was so dim, it was particularly striking in the darkness.</p>
<p>The Lich stopped.</p>
<p>The faint light flickered in the dark, and it was like a call, a temptation, a desire, a sneer</p>
<p>The wind, blowing his black skirt, like the past countless years, he gazed at the place.</p>
<p>Many years ago, he also stood here, but at that time, there was a brother beside him, and in front of him, there was a figure that was thin but seemed to block the world.</p>
<p>But now, he is the only figure alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Empress&hellip;&rdquo; He lowered his head slightly and called out in a low voice.</p>
<p>Then he floated forward, casting a light like a moth.</p>
<p>The dark light is great, and the wind in the ancient cave is suddenly fierce. Originally only a little light, slowly scattered from that place, will slowly light up around.</p>
<p>On the uneven ground, there are decayed bones everywhere, some of them are figures and some are beasts. The huge wall of the cave, hard rock, in the light, but showed countless dense, crisscross cracks, as if torn apart by life, shocking.</p>
<p>In the dark, there&rsquo;s a voice. In the deepest part of the dim light, with a chill, gently reverberates.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re back&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ending sound is very long, reverberating between the walls of this ancient cave.</p>
<p>The Lich did not speak. He just stood in the light, stood for a moment, and then, out of the black, put his arm on his hand. It is a black stick inlaid with bone jade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roar!&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A roar, suddenly like thunder, boiling in the ancient cave. The darkness around him retreated in an instant, and in the depths of that dark awn, a dazzling light flashed in a twinkling, like the innumerable tentacles of demons, shouting and Howling towards the Lich and the two sacred vessels.</p>
<p>Even the stone wall of the ancient cave around it has been shaking for thousands of years. Big rocks and small stones fall.</p>
<p>The wind, whistling and shrill, at the moment, sounds like a long, heavy breath.</p>
<p>“…… Do you remember what a lady looks like The Lich looked at the dazzling light in front of him, and suddenly said so quietly.</p>
<p>In the strong light, the twinkling light suddenly solidified.</p>
<p>The Lich is dressed in black, hunting in the strong wind.</p>
<p>Even his voice sounded so erratic: &ldquo;her stone statue is still standing on the hole outside&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Deep in the light, there was no sound. Only the stretching and shrinking light makes the Lich&rsquo;s figure bright and dark.</p>
<p>The Lich did not say any more, and slowly floated up into the depths of the light.</p>
<p>A flat, open place. It is quite different from the outside. The hard stone walls are mostly intact, but on the ground, there are many huge bones, and most of them are in good condition. There are as many as thirteen.</p>
<p>These 13 skeletons with different shapes and emitting the spirit of evil spirits are all wrapped in a circle at different distances, all of them are inside the face, back and outside, as if guarding something. In the dark and empty eye hole, it seems that there are cold eyes.</p>
<p>As the figure of the Lich suddenly appeared, it began to approach this strange circle. Suddenly, a sour &ldquo;Chueh&rdquo; sound appeared in the cold wind. On these bones, there were several heads that started to turn, slowly turned around and looked in the direction of the Lich.</p>
<p>In this terrible time when the heart almost stopped beating, the Lich did not seem to care about these terrible skeletons. His eyes, from the beginning to the end, were only looking at one place.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the middle of the circle of thirteen white bones.</p>
<p>A life size white bone was quietly lying on a white jade platform only three inches high. Unlike the skeletons around it, the human skeleton was also covered with silk. I don&rsquo;t know how many years it has gone through. Under the light, the color of the silk is still incomparably bright.</p>
<p>And all the light around, even the howling wind, are from the white bone.</p>
<p>The Lich drifted closer to the white bone.</p>
<p>Light flow, strange light for a short time, as if in the dark, eyes are watching him.</p>
<p>Around, all the 13 white bones suddenly gave out the sound of &ldquo;Kuai&rdquo;, almost as if they were resurrected together. Their heads turned and their deep eye holes were staring at the figure of the Lich.</p>
<p>The next moment, that piece of silk rises in the air, floating in the air.</p>
<p>It was as if there was a silent low roar. In an instant, the dazzling light shone from under the silk, like an unstoppable arrow, roaring away in all directions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Woo!&rdquo; The Lich even felt that the light with surging Demon power rushed through his ears.</p>
<p>The fierce wind, mixed with a gloomy sneer, began to reverberate in this ancient cave.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, the thirteen skeletons looked up and roared to the sky!</p>
<p>Under this strange atmosphere, the Lich slowly fell in front of the bones. There are five bone fragments in his spine and right hand, which are very clear in the upper part of his spine and his right hand.</p>
<p>At the moment, reflecting the light of his bones, he had a white bead on his right hand, a jade dish on his left ankle, and a ring at the broken throat.</p>
<p>The Lich slowly pulled out the bone jade inlaid on the black stick, and then gently put it on the white bone&rsquo;s head. There was a small hole in the middle of the forehead, and the bone jade just put it in.</p>
<p>In the dark, it seems that there is a voice, calling from afar.</p>
<p>The Lich&rsquo;s body suddenly trembled, and the whole person shook. The light reflected in his eyes, like two burning white flames.</p>
<p>Whose soul and body is the flame burning?</p>
<p>He seemed to give a little cry. But no one heard what he said. The next moment, he put the black stick in the middle of the white bone. The spine.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, everything was still.</p>
<p>The howling wind stopped, the dazzling white light disappeared, the darkness like the boundless sea, the surging waves silently rushed up and submerged everything!</p>
<p>Who is waiting in the dark?</p>
<p>The deepest darkness. Or the dawn of fantasy?</p>
<p>Everything calmed down, just like the desolate silence that has never changed since ancient times. The white bones stopped shouting and became silent.</p>
<p>A voice, in the depths of darkness and silence, quietly, rings out!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bang!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bang!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bang bang!&rdquo;</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>It was the sound of heartbeat, full of new vitality, and the surrounding was still dark, but the heartbeat sound like magic was gradually amplified. Slowly, began to flow gurgling water sound.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s not the sound of the water, it&rsquo;s the blood flowing from the heart, dancing wildly in the dark with endless joy and irresistible momentum.</p>
<p>Long sleep for countless years, after endless cold, once again warm!</p>
<p>Who is breathing quietly in the dark?</p>
<p>The roaring sound was more and more violent. Like the imprisoned soul, the cry of resentment for thousands of years has been condensed. Every drop of rebirth blood is with madness and defiance!</p>
<p>Slowly, the noise around began to ring. The solid stone wall shakes again, and the white bones in the dark cry again to meet the reborn demons.</p>
<p>Only the lich, his figure disappeared in the dark, felt the invisible but dancing demons in front of him, felt the reborn soul and flowing blood.</p>
<p>That feeling. Almost swallowed him up</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bang!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a loud noise, a huge force smashed the hard ground into a big hole, and the gold bottle flew backward. He narrowly escaped the attack from behind, and his face turned white.</p>
<p>The stone statue woman just now seemed to have magic power. She attracted all her spirits and spirits to her, and she completely forgot about her life. However, when the wind broke out, she suddenly woke up and rushed out almost at a time when there was no chance of her death.</p>
<p>Jinpinger was panting, and suddenly the wind was strong behind him. The evil spirit had already followed him like a bone cone. It was clear that his body was only composed of invisible white Qi, but the huge sword and shield in his hand were as light as children&rsquo;s toys.</p>
<p>Jinpinger knew how powerful he was, so he didn&rsquo;t dare to pick it up. The whole person quickly hid behind. Under these two swords, the evil spirit had already driven the Golden Vase from the entrance of the ancient cave of Zhenmeng several Zhang away.</p>
<p>As soon as she fell to the ground, the Golden Vase turned her right hand, and purple mang Dun rose. The magic weapon, the purple awn blade, had already been offered and held in the palm of her hand.</p>
<p>However, although she was alert, the evil spirit drove her to three Zhang away from the ancient cave, and then did not catch up with her. His invisible body was still floating around the stone statue woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who do you dare to come to this land of demons and blaspheme the images of witch maids?&rdquo; The evil spirit glared at the copper bell, and walked coldly.</p>
<p>The golden vase&rsquo;er breathed a sigh of relief, calmed down and said in a loud voice, &ldquo;you misunderstood me. I didn&rsquo;t mean to offend this It&rsquo;s just the first time I saw the statue. She was so beautiful that I could not help touching it with my hands. &quot;</p>
<p>The evil spirit snorted, and his face was slightly gentle. Obviously, he knew that the stone statue had magical powers, but his voice was still cold. He said, &ldquo;you are young and you are a new offender. I don&rsquo;t care about you. This is the place of demons and ghosts, not the place where you come from. Go quickly</p>
<p>Jinpinger frowned. According to her will, she had followed the Lich for so long. Most of the most important secret was in the ancient cave of the town. Unexpectedly, there was such a fierce spirit guarding the entrance of the cave, which was really troublesome. But if you want to break in, most of them will disturb the Lich or some monster inside. If you don&rsquo;t say it, it&rsquo;s hard to solve the problem of the evil spirit in front of you.</p>
<p>She was worrying about it. The evil spirit saw that the woman&rsquo;s eyes were sweeping over the statues of herself and the empress, and at the same time peered into the dark cave behind her. Obviously, she wanted to make this cave, and she couldn&rsquo;t help changing color.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on The evil spirit cried angrily and said, &ldquo;little girl, I advise you not to look for bitterness. This cave is a unique monster, and you will seek your own death when you go in. Besides, I will guard the ancient cave, and I will definitely not let outsiders in. You should have died of this heart long ago</p>
<p>The Golden Vase snorted. Where Ken is so easy to give up and say, &ldquo;the man in black just now, didn&rsquo;t he go in as usual?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The evil spirit was stunned, and the essence of his eyes was full of light. &ldquo;So you&rsquo;re following that man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jin Ping&rsquo;er looks at his words and looks. He has some doubts about the relationship between the two men, but he still says: &ldquo;of course, that man is not like a man, a ghost is not like a ghost Well, I didn&rsquo;t mean you.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be angry He said to the black jade that he had just robbed of the black weapon</p>
<p>Before the word &ldquo;Mo&rdquo; was uttered, the evil spirit whose face had changed greatly suddenly gave out an earth shaking roar. Shengsheng forced the Golden Vase&rsquo;s words back, which made her look pale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you say. He has a black stick and a bone jade? &quot; The whole body of the evil spirit began to shake violently.</p>
<p>The Golden Vase son is a little surprised, way: &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The evil spirit roared up to the sky and was extremely indignant. Looking at his appearance, he was almost desperate to rush into the ancient cave to find the Lich.</p>
<p>But at this time, both the Golden Vase and the evil spirit were stunned at the same time.</p>
<p>As if the never-ending wind blowing from the ancient cave of demons stopped suddenly.</p>
<p>Between heaven and earth, it seems that something is missing. Special silence.</p>
<p>The evil spirit&rsquo;s face turned pale.</p>
<p>His mouth widened, as if to say something, as if to shout with all his strength, but. But nothing came out.</p>
<p>Then, he slowly turned around and looked at the stone statue woman. Suddenly, his body was shocked again, and his huge body was soft. He knelt down in front of the stone statue woman and burst into tears.</p>
<p>Jin pinger was shocked. She was born in a demon sect. She had seen so many strange things in her life. However, a ferocious spirit with such a high level of Taoism suddenly cried in front of her, which was the only one in her life. Just look at the extremely sad spirit, so big body, it is not stop trembling, although it is only composed of white gas, but the sad mood, it seems that all live in front of you.</p>
<p>The Golden Vase moved quietly, and the evil spirit did not notice her. When she moved to the stone statue woman, she was planning to sneak into the ancient cave of Zhenmeng by taking advantage of this opportunity. Suddenly, her body was shocked, and her eyes were fixed on the stone statue woman.</p>
<p>On the cold stone statue, the graceful and beautiful woman.</p>
<p>Two lines of clear tears slipped from the stone&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>Originally, thousands of years of time, or can&rsquo;t erase a deep sadness</p>
<p>The Golden Vase son stands in astonishment behind the evil spirit, looking at this sad stone statue!</p>
<p>In the cave behind him, a distant murmur, like something, wakes up from his long sleep and makes the sound of the first sentence.</p>
<p>The wind rises again, the sound is more desolate!</p>
<p>Even the sky and sky above were so dim.</p>
<p>A flash of lightning pierced the black clouds.</p>
<p>A thunder burst into the sky.</p>
<p>Thunder and lightning roar, the twinkling of an eye tears the sky. Countless black clouds, like boiling, surged from the sky of 100000 mountains and gathered above the ancient cave of Zhenmo.</p>
<p>Pouring rain, thundering down, mixed with huge hail, will hit the ground pit.</p>
<p>The golden vase&rsquo;er was startled, dodging from left to right, floating in the wind and rain. The evil spirit looked up at the sky, all the rain and frost seemed to have no effect on him, but his eyes were full of despair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked up to the sky and cried.</p>
<p>In this despairing roar, the strange roar in the ancient cave of demons was heard. From far and near, it became faster and louder, and finally it was deafening. The Golden Vase only felt a roar in his mind, which seemed to crack. He couldn&rsquo;t help but change color for it and quickly swept it to the distance.</p>
<p>But the evil spirit suddenly turned around and blocked his huge body at the entrance of the ancient cave. He raised his shield, raised his sword, and glared at him. He did not show any fear.</p>
<p>That howling sound is more and more loud, in a flash has already rushed to the ancient cave entrance.</p>
<p>The sky thundered and the sky roared, as if all the mountains of the 100000 mountains were shaking together.</p>
<p>In the wind and rain, the evil spirit looks like a wavering and powerless boat.</p>
<p>The deep darkness, like a wild beast, pounced on him from the ancient cave.</p>
<p>Ferocious spirit roars, head-on!</p>
<p>The huge sword reflected the lightning passing through the sky and cut into the darkness. The black air was cut from it in an instant, but it immediately jumped up from both sides, drowning his body with an extremely rapid speed.</p>
<p>From afar, the Golden Vase still heard the voice: &ldquo;Niang&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the next moment, the evil spirits disappeared, and the black air was like a mountain. They gathered at the entrance of the ancient cave, facing the sky and the earth.</p>
<p>A red light flashed through the darkness.</p>
<p>A figure, a man wrapped in a piece of brilliant silk, with his back to the direction of the Golden Vase, fell slowly from the black air and stood in front of the stone statue woman.</p>
<p>Behind him, there was a roar in the black air, and the shadow shook, as if there were countless demons howling with ecstasy.</p>
<p>Only his back looks a little strange.</p>
<p>Standing in front of the statue, he stood in silence in the wind and rain.</p>
<p>Slowly, hand out, gently touch, that cold stone.</p>
<p>Low voice, quietly reverberated in the wind and rain, through thousands of years of time, through countless wind, rain, snow and frost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Linglong&hellip;&rdquo; (to be continued. )</p>
