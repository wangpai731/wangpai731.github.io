      <p>After slapping himself in the face, Zhang Xiaofan stood still and could not help breathing. After a long time, his mood gradually calmed down. Then he shook his head and smiled bitterly. He said to himself, &ldquo;Zhang Xiaofan, you are the old man. A little disciple of Qingyun sect, who is not in the mainstream, dare to question the morality handed down by his ancestors. It&rsquo;s beyond his capacity. Qingyun gate has been passed on for more than two thousand years. The world&rsquo;s admiration is right. Where can you doubt? &quot;</p>
<p>When he thought of it, he was in a relaxed mood. Although he had some self consolation meanings, it was very effective, so he stopped thinking about it and lay down in peace.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, I didn&rsquo;t lie down, but suddenly I heard a sharp voice breaking the air over the island, which was originally silent only with the sound of tide and sea wind.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan immediately jumped up and looked up. He saw the night sky, a white light like a summer meteor, shining through the sky. But after it, there were several lights, but the color was red, yellow and white.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan looks at it for a few times and knows that it&rsquo;s a way of fighting in the sky with the sword in the cultivation. What&rsquo;s more, it&rsquo;s obvious that the first one escapes and the second one follows.</p>
<p>In this remote place, there were no people. At this moment, there are people fighting in the sky. It must be the righteous people and the people in the demon sect. Zhang Xiaofan has been looking for many days in the vast east sea. He is anxious and happy at first sight. Anyway, one of the two sides must be the right person, let alone hesitant. With the help of the formula, the fire stick rises in the air to fight against the sky.</p>
<p>The fire staff carries Zhang Xiaofan and sends out &ldquo;woo&hellip;&rdquo; in the boundless night Voice, rush to. But few people in the sky seem to have thought that there are people on the remote island. The first one thinks it&rsquo;s an ambush, but the second one thinks it&rsquo;s a trap set by the other. At present, there was a yell. The white light in the front turned around, and the red light, yellow light and white light in the back turned around. They all called Zhang Xiaofan.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was shocked and cried in his heart, and immediately fell into the dilemma of suffering from the enemy. However, how fast these magic weapons came? How could he explain them? Now he just stopped in the middle of the air and fell down. Fall like a stone.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>These two groups of four in the sky seem to be experts. They react very quickly. They can see the situation in a moment, and their magic weapons pause in the air. Unexpectedly, they also followed one after another, such as the bone attached cone.</p>
<p>However, a few of the two factions also made a slight cry and doubted slightly. Obviously, they found that the other side, like themselves, wanted to kill the unexpected guest.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan is the only one who has been wronged. All of a sudden, he is chased by these four magic weapons behind him. He is afraid that he will be a different person. Listening to the wind behind him, Zhang Xiaofan clenched his teeth. Knowing that hiding is impossible, he turned around in the falling air, but saw the four lights roaring like thunder and lightning. He shouted, the fire staff was dark blue and bright, and he stood in front of him, blocking the blow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boom&rdquo; a loud sound, in the calm sea far spread out, four light back, Zhang Xiaofan but with the fire stick. Heavily from the sky was smashed down, fell into the water, &ldquo;plop&rdquo; sound, splashed the old high.</p>
<p>Huge ripples. On the water surface, four people in the sky don&rsquo;t run away. They don&rsquo;t run after each other. After a moment of confrontation between the two sides in the mid air, they feel faint in their hearts. Just now, I&rsquo;m afraid there&rsquo;s something strange in the middle.</p>
<p>After a while, I saw a person slowly floating on the water surface, floating on the water surface, looking like that, I fainted. The four people in the sky came down at the same time, and they were wary of each other. They approached the water carefully and gathered the stars in the sky. They finally saw the people in the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Xiaofan!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two exclamations came from both sides of the population at the same time.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>The cold sea water is soaking, which makes Zhang Xiaofan think in a trance that he is still in the merciless sea under the dead soul abyss of kongsang mountain, and under the ground where the sun is not visible, but how can there be such bright stars in the sky?</p>
<p>He shook his head, woke up and looked around. He saw himself lying on the bank, but there were four people standing on the beach in the distance. One side was a woman in green, the other was a woman and two men. Looking at the dress, it was under the Qingyun gate.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan fixed his mind and looked at the woman and the man. I saw that the two men were familiar with each other. They were song Daren and Du Bishu. The woman&rsquo;s eyebrows are picturesque, dressed in red, and her face is so familiar with each other.</p>
<p>For a moment, he felt his whole body was boiling with blood, and his mind was buzzing. He had no other thoughts. He looked at it directly and cried out: &ldquo;elder martial sister!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman in red turned around and smiled at the sound. It seemed that the overseas island and the bleak night were bright: &ldquo;I knew you wouldn&rsquo;t die so easily, son!&rdquo;</p>
<p>What words can describe that fanaticism? Zhang Xiaofan felt that thousands of words were stuck in his heart, endless thoughts and suffering. These days, his thoughts at the critical moment of life and death rushed up and looked at the beautiful woman in front of him, who was smiling and smiling. He was in a deep heart for some reason. Suddenly, he was sad and started to cry.</p>
<p>Senior sister, senior sister, senior sister! He read in his heart many times, many times, and now suddenly appeared in front of his eyes, he would never see anyone again.</p>
<p>Until, that one voice with angry voice rings out: &ldquo;Zhang Xiaofan, you this dead guy, unexpectedly don&rsquo;t even look at me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan is scared. It&rsquo;s not just him. It seems that Tian linger&rsquo;s three people are also scared. Zhang Xiaofan has just returned to his senses. He turns around and looks at it, but this surprise is extraordinary.</p>
<p>The moon is like water, the stars are all over the sky, shining on the beach of this isolated overseas island. The girl in water and green clothes has thin anger on her face, her skin is better than snow, and her eyes are like water. She is staring at Zhang Xiaofan with hatred, but who is not Biyao?</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan is facing her. Suddenly, he feels nervous. His words are not smooth. Nah, Nah, how can you be here</p>
<p>Biyao stares at him hatefully, but doesn&rsquo;t answer. Then her eyes are on Tian ling&rsquo;er&rsquo;s face on the other side. Tian ling&rsquo;er looks really beautiful and has outstanding looks. She doesn&rsquo;t know where the fire is coming from.</p>
<p>On that day, in the Haiyun tower of Changhe City, after walking with the woman in black late at night, Biyao met her father outside the city. Then she came to Liubo mountain in the East China Sea with her father and met all the people. We are going to do a big thing on Liubo mountain. At the same time, the righteous people also follow. The two sides have been confronting each other on Liubo mountain for several days.</p>
<p>Counting the days, Biyao expected that Zhang Xiaofan had arrived. After the experience of living and dying together in the blood drop cave of the dead soul yuan, and later getting along with each other all the way, Biyao was somehow concerned about this ordinary Qingyun disciple. The sun and the moon were white and the wind was clear, but suddenly she could no longer bear it.</p>
<p>In my heart, I just want to see Zhang Xiaofan again. Then I sneaked out and touched Qingyun gate&rsquo;s residence. I didn&rsquo;t find Zhang Xiaofan, but Tian linger and others found him and chased him out.</p>
<p>In fact, in the middle of the day, Zhang Xiaofan should have arrived at Liubo mountain, but nobody expected that Zhang Xiaofan had lost his way in the East China Sea for the first time when he went out. After a long delay, Biyao arrived a few days earlier than him.</p>
<p>This night, unexpectedly, she ran into Zhang Xiaofan on the island. Biyao was overjoyed, and she hurt him just now. She was also very sorry.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, after Zhang Xiaofan woke up, he didn&rsquo;t know whether he was hurt or not, but first he saw that this smelly boy would fly for nine days as soon as he saw his elder martial sister. He was so fascinated that he didn&rsquo;t even know who he was. Biyao didn&rsquo;t fight at all. Where is there any apology? I wish I could catch this kid and beat him first!</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan looks at Biyao. Seeing her angry look, he turns to look at her. Seeing Tian ling&rsquo;er and the two elder martial brothers open their eyes wide, there is confusion on their faces.</p>
<p>He was sandwiched in the middle, intending to explain to his elder martial brother and elder sister, but he didn&rsquo;t know what to say. Turning to Baguio, I was excited when I saw the general vision of Shuibo, the girl of the demon sect. Chest a stuffy, unexpectedly is a wow, vomited the mouth blood to come out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; Tian ling&rsquo;er and Bi Yao called out at the same time.</p>
<p>In fact, Zhang Xiaofan is not a big deal. He was hit by four people in the middle of the air just now. Although there are real Dharma bodyguards and fire sticks in front of him to block most of the power, song Daren and others have deeper cultivation than Zhang Xiaofan. Although they found something wrong and collected a few parts of the power, they still smashed him down. Fortunately, it&rsquo;s just below the sea level. It&rsquo;s not a big earthquake. Otherwise, if it&rsquo;s hard, it&rsquo;s enough for Zhang Xiaofan.</p>
<p>At this time, Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s chest was depressed, and he was stimulated by the embarrassing scene. His Qi and blood surged, and even a mouthful of blood gushed out, but it was congestion. Although it was exaggerated, it didn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>But how did Tian ling&rsquo;er and others know that she and this little younger martial brother were very close since they were young. With concern, she immediately ran over. Unexpectedly, her body was still moving, and she saw that the girl of the evil cult opposite was also worried and ran over.</p>
<p>Tian ling&rsquo;er, after all, is a daughter&rsquo;s home. Her mind is delicate and she stops in amazement. But song Daren and Du Bishu read it, but they thought that the evil cult fairy would take advantage of the injury of the younger martial brother and take advantage of the danger of others. With a loud cry, song Daren&rsquo;s &ldquo;ten tigers&rdquo; fairy sword grew bigger in the wind, and he chopped it towards the green Yao.</p>
<p>Biyao is worried about Zhang Xiaofan, but she is stopped by the big man. She is angry for a while, but she can&rsquo;t look down on it. She turned her body into a green awn. Unexpectedly, she passed through the light of the ten tigers when it was urgent. It&rsquo;s just that I haven&rsquo;t flown out for a long time. Suddenly I see the white light in front of me, and a strange square magic weapon comes here.</p>
<p>For a while, Biyao couldn&rsquo;t see what it was. She didn&rsquo;t dare to take it hard. She had to stop. Her right hand was in the wind. A white flower appeared between her jade like fingers. It was her favorite magic weapon, &ldquo;sad flower&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Sad flower, with the Baguio formula, rises up in the air and catches the strange thing. At a glance, Biyao didn&rsquo;t think it was angry and funny. She looked at the six squares in front of her. There were some numbers engraved on them. Unexpectedly, it was a dice. Unexpectedly, there was such a deviant magic weapon in the right way. It was really rare.</p>
<p>Sad flower white light force, when Du Bishu&rsquo;s dice forced back a Zhangyuan, it seems that Du Bishu&rsquo;s Taoism is not as good as Biyao&rsquo;s. However, Du Bishu&rsquo;s cultivation is not as good as song Daren&rsquo;s, but people are more nimble. When they see that the Taoism is not enough, they don&rsquo;t touch it hard. They sacrifice two other dice and fly up and down to harass them.</p>
<p>Three dice gallop as fast as electricity, hit up and down one, turn around and take care of the left and right. Although they can&rsquo;t get into the range of sad flower, Biyao can&rsquo;t get past for a while, only for a moment, song Daren behind has already rushed up again.</p>
<p>Biyao just had a hand with song Daren. Knowing that this man has a deep cultivation, he really wants to fight alone. He has not yet won the battle. In addition to the devil in the front, there is also a &ldquo;elder martial sister ling&rsquo;er&rdquo; in Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s mouth. I don&rsquo;t expect that I can make up my mind tonight. At present, I took a long look at Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s place, and I hated and scolded him: &ldquo;Stinky boy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren is waiting to catch up. But see is fighting with Du Bishu&rsquo;s Fairy body suddenly fly back, in the hand that flower suddenly turned into thousands of strange flowers, for a time to block out the sun, the heart was shocked. Suddenly, she was on guard. Unexpectedly, it was just a blind trick for Baguio. Among the thousands of flowers, she saw the green figure of Baguio rising to the sky and galloping away.</p>
<p>Song Daren is just going after him. Then he heard Du Bishu and Tian linger call out at the same time: &ldquo;elder martial brother, don&rsquo;t pursue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren then came back to him. He quickly put away his magic sword and ran to Zhang Xiaofan with the others.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Liubo mountain in the East China Sea is a grand and precipitous mountain, covering a very wide area. In terms of its size, it is actually the first among the island mountains in the East China Sea. However, the mountain is remote and rarely seen. Therefore, in terms of fame, it is far inferior to the other two famous mountain islands in the East China Sea - &ldquo;Penglai Xianshan&rdquo; and &ldquo;Yanluo island&rdquo;.</p>
<p>However, Liubo mountain at the moment is the most lively time since ancient times. For several days, the devil characters seem to search for something in the mountain. Although the mountains are vast, the people who practice Taoism often encounter unexpected situations when they come and go at such a high speed. Both sides &ldquo;bitter enemy deep&rdquo;, often a meeting to see clearly then shipped magic weapon smashed in the past, one come and two go. The sound is loud, and the fellow Taoist friends come to help each other, so they become a &ldquo;group fight&rdquo; posture, countless brilliant or sinister magic weapons. Flying over Liubo mountain.</p>
<p>For several days, dozens of people were killed and injured in each faction, and the small hills and hills on Liubo mountain were also leveled and smashed.</p>
<p>After meeting with Tian linger and others that night, Zhang Xiaofan finally found the place of Liubo mountain under their leadership. I also saw Shifu Tian and Shiniang Su Ru.</p>
<p>It turns out that the rise of the demon sect has a strong momentum. Not only are some old demons hiding for many years coming out again, but also a lot of new faces are emerging. Moreover, the Taoist practice is not low. It can be seen that in recent years, the demon sect has kept a low profile, which is really a plan.</p>
<p>The enemy is so powerful that people in the right path dare not neglect it. After discussing with Tianyin temple and burning incense Valley, Taoist XuanZhen, the leader of Qingyun sect, sent four elite disciples of dragon head peak, Chaoyang peak, Dazhu peak and Xiaozhu peak, among the seven branches under the sect. The first Taoist of Cangsong and the first field of Dazhu peak were not easy to live in the first place. With the help of several elders, he brought ten Qingyun disciples, together with Tianyin temple and burning incense Valley, and a few other righteous Sanxian To Liubo mountain.</p>
<p>Tian is not easy to see Zhang Xiaofan at first sight. He looks stunned. Although she is happy, she can still hold it, but Su Ru, the teacher&rsquo;s mother, doesn&rsquo;t have so many scruples. She smiles and pulls Zhang Xiaofan aside to ask.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was grateful. Seeing that his teacher&rsquo;s tears were about to come out again, he forced himself to hold back and told the story about it. However, he was afraid of the identity of Bagao, so he hid the story of Bagao and dixue cave. He only said that he was trapped in the belly of the mountain for several days. Fortunately, he found a secret way to escape yunyun.</p>
<p>Everyone listened and sighed. It was a real escape.</p>
<p>This time, four of the disciples of dazhufeng came: Song Daren, he Dazhi, Du Bishu and Tian linger. From their mouths, Zhang Xiaofan learned that eight of them were in the wanbat ancient cave that day, including the FA Xiang and FA Shan of Tianyin temple, Li Xun and Yan Hong of the burning incense Valley, and Qi Hao and Zeng Shushu were safe and sound.</p>
<p>The most dangerous one is Lu Xueqi, who fell into the necrotic abyss with Zhang Xiaofan. She was poisoned by the naked pig demon, and was injured in the fight with the spirit tree demon. Then, in the big &ldquo;tsunami&rdquo; of the ancient Warcraft black water black snake, the whole person was knocked unconscious by the huge wave and fell into the necrotic abyss. However, Qi Hao and others, who took the chance to dive down the lifeless abyss to save people, found Lu Xueqi surrounded by countless spirits by the blue light of the guardian from the God sword of Tianya, which snatched her back from the hall of hell.</p>
<p>At that time, Lu Xueqi just woke up and said that Zhang Xiaofan was still alive and under the abyss of the dead. But they had no clue for several days. Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s remaining poison was not clear and his serious injury was not cured. But somehow, they still insisted on finding Zhang Xiaofan. After a few days, she couldn&rsquo;t support her, so people had to ignore her strong opposition, give up looking, and take Lu Xueqi back to Qingyun Mountain.</p>
<p>This time, Qingyun gate came to the East in a big way. These old acquaintances of Zhang Xiaofan, except for Zeng Shushu, all came here.</p>
<p>Tian ling&rsquo;er said with a smile: &ldquo;if elder martial sister Lu Xueqi knew you were safe, she would be very happy. You don&rsquo;t know how anxious she was that she couldn&rsquo;t find you in the abyss of death! &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was stunned for a moment. Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s appearance appeared in his mind. He thought of how many times she had rescued her under the abyss of the dead spirit. He couldn&rsquo;t help being grateful. He said: &ldquo;elder martial sister Lu is looking after the friendship with her family. I am&hellip; &quot; After saying that, I suddenly thought of something. Turning to Tian ling&rsquo;er, I said, &ldquo;elder martial sister, you were not here at that time. How can I know that elder martial sister Lu is anxious? &quot;</p>
<p>Tian ling&rsquo;er put out his tongue, made a face and said with a smile, &ldquo;I listen to elder martial brother Qihao.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was stunned and looked at the face of elder martial sister ling&rsquo;er, who was smiling and smiling, suddenly. Since I met again, my heart has been boiling, and it&rsquo;s cold.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>The next day, there was another dispute between the two factions.</p>
<p>In the fighting method, the God monks in Tianyin Temple saw the trees were in a mess, and the wild boar, hare, dog, snake and other creatures in the forest were devastated. They sighed and recited the past life mercy curse. After reading, a &ldquo;Amitabha&rdquo;, a wave of Buddha&rsquo;s fingers, a magic stone to hit.</p>
<p>The people in the demon sect dodged and roared. It was a small mountain to pay for the expenses. The life was burnt again, so they had to recite the past life curse again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thief bald ass, dead bald head, some kind of people will close their mouths and fight to the death. They will gabble and chant a bird mantra there all day. I&rsquo;m tired of you if I don&rsquo;t die under your mantra!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amitabha, benefactor of wild dog. You are so sinful that you don&rsquo;t look back. I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ll fall into the abyss after death! &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bah, bah, bah! Thief monk, are you a monk? How dare you curse me directly! &quot;</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan is familiar with the sound after hearing it. Looking closely, it was the strange looking wild dog Taoist in wanbat ancient cave of kongsang mountain that day. At the moment, he is standing in front of the evil cult camp, with a face full of anger and a mouth full of foam, swearing at the halberd finger of a monk in Tianyin temple. At the same time, the elder brother, Lin Feng, Liu Hao and the beautiful young woman are all standing in the evil cult.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was thinking that these guys also came here. Suddenly, someone recited a Buddha&rsquo;s name behind him. &ldquo;Amitabha! How are you, younger martial brother Zhang!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan looks back, but he is an acquaintance. He is the two people of FA Xiang and FA Shan in Tianyin temple. Among the eight people in wanbat ancient grottoes, the two monks of Tianyin temple have always been close to him, especially the Dharma phase. And from Tian ling&rsquo;er&rsquo;s mouth, he also knew that although he had made the decision to leave the dead spirit pit in spite of Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s objection on that day, it was the Dharma phase, but it was said that he could not pretend his deep pain in any way.</p>
<p>After hearing this, Zhang Xiaofan was always grateful. At this time, he saw that they were both good at Dharma and Dharma, and hurriedly saluted: &ldquo;Hello, two elder martial brothers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>FA Xiang looked at him carefully, took a long breath, smiled, and said: &ldquo;the ancients said:&rdquo; blessed people have their own blessings. &ldquo;Now I believe. Younger martial brother Zhang will not die in a big disaster. He is very happy and will be blessed later. &quot;</p>
<p>The tall and big Fasan stood behind the elder martial brother who was a head shorter than him, and said: &ldquo;good luck, younger martial brother Zhang!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was grateful and said, &ldquo;thank you very much for your thoughts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>FA Xiang smiles and nods. Then he looks at the audience. The dog Taoist has started to fight with the monk of Tianyin temple. He reaches out his hand and taps him on the shoulder, saying, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s talk when we have time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan quickly replied, &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>FA Xiang walked out two steps, then turned around and smiled at Zhang Xiaofan. &ldquo;Younger martial brother Zhang, you are free to go to see your benefactor Lu Xueqi. She is very worried about you!&rdquo; Said on the surface micro strip mysterious, and the law good looks at each other and smiles, went together.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan stayed for a while and couldn&rsquo;t help looking at the small bamboo peak of Qingyun gate. This time, in the future of the first Shuiyue master of xiaozhufeng, the female disciples, led by Wenmin, the eldest martial sister, followed the difficult dispatch of Taoist Cangsong and Tian. Lu Xueqi is standing among them at the moment.</p>
<p>After more than a month&rsquo;s absence, Lu Xueqi looks thinner. I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s caused by those injuries. But from here, Zhang Xiaofan still has a sense of amazement. She only feels that this woman is born gorgeous and peerless. Even if she is thin, it seems that the drop of cold dew gently exposed in the blooming lilies is desolate and proud, adding to the beauty.</p>
<p>Most of the female disciples in xiaozhufeng gate are beautiful women, attracting countless eyes around them. In addition to the old monks in Tianyin temple, male disciples such as Qingyun gate and burning incense Valley, all of them consciously or unconsciously look at this place. Lu Xueqi has attracted the most attention. But at this time, she recovered her original coldness and arrogance. When her eyes inadvertently swept over Zhang Xiaofan, they only stopped for a while and then moved away without any other expression.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan seems to have lost something in his heart, but after a while he is still happy. At first, he was afraid of the cold and beautiful woman. Now, seeing that she didn&rsquo;t take care of herself, he was relaxed. Within a moment, his spirit was attracted by Tian linger&rsquo;s &ldquo;giggle&rdquo; laughter, and could not be turned around again. (to be continued. )</p>
