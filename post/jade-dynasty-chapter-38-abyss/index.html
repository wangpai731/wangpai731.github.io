      <p>According to the legend, the world was originally dark. In the following forty-eight thousand years, there was Pangu, a giant god, who opened up the world and turned mountains and rivers. In another forty-eight thousand years, Nuwa made people.</p>
<p>According to legend, the first light between heaven and earth is born in the darkest place.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan only felt that his whole body was cold and cold into the bone marrow, as if it was not only his body, but also his heart, and he was going to die.</p>
<p>But he didn&rsquo;t feel afraid. He didn&rsquo;t have any fear. He just felt that he had never been tired. He didn&rsquo;t even have the strength to open his eyes. It&rsquo;s strange that when he was extremely sleepy and weak, his mind gradually became clear.</p>
<p>It seems that there is something surrounding him, very gentle and careful, but cold as ice, slowly sucking the heat in his body, with a strange comfortable feeling, people can&rsquo;t help but want to sleep so comfortably.</p>
<p>If not, there is a familiar and cold breath in his right hand, like the rising of the guard master; if not, he suddenly feels that in his left hand, he still holds a cold and soft hand.</p>
<p>He opened his eyes one by one in drowsiness!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a light in eternal darkness!</p>
<p>In the endless darkness, but only in front of Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s eyes, there was a little light. It was a kind of quiet light with white color. It was floating in the darkness, twining with Zhang Xiaofan, like the most gentle woman, holding her beloved lover and lingering with him.</p>
<p>It is like a light smoke, with some nihilism, in the mid air, beside Zhang Xiaofan, gradually turned into a beautiful and sad face, toward the young lips, kiss!</p>
<p>That lips, there is a light fragrance, there is a silk meaning chaos, there are, but only cold!</p>
<p>Cold into the heart of the cold!</p>
<p>The firecracker rose. The dark blue light blocked Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s body, and the white face of the smoke like beauty seemed to be afraid of this, and had to back away. Zhang Xiaofan was shocked. Turn over and get up, and then you will come over and cry out: &ldquo;Yinling!&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to the old legend, life is old and dead, only the soul can&rsquo;t be destroyed. At the end of one&rsquo;s life, there will be a soul out of body, to cast into the next life, to live, to reincarnate. However, in the world, there are grievances, which are caused by greed, hatred and ignorance, and by fear, evil and fear. They are attached to the world and look back on the past. Not willing to die, is for the &ldquo;spirit&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Of course, Yin spirit is the thing of Yin spirit. Naturally, it likes to stay in the place of yin and humidity. It&rsquo;s not surprising that there are such ghosts in the abyss of dead spirit. But Zhang Xiaofan has never seen such things in his life. When he was a child, he heard that there were ghosts in the world from the adults in Caomiao village. Later, he heard that elder martial brothers said it was called Yinling on Dazhu peak. He was afraid of it. He saw it suddenly. It&rsquo;s really cold from the head to the feet.</p>
<p>His cry, only in the dark far out, in the surrounding darkness, his voice seems to be light. After a long time, a faint echo came back. It was also with his cry that something seemed to stir, and in the darkness around him, it lit up again silently.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan felt that his heart was beating, and then it was as if the heart in his chest had stopped. He held his breath as like as two peas of white light, which were almost exactly the same as the ghost, and lit up in the darkness ahead.</p>
<p>Then, the light on the left, the light on the right, the light on the front and the light on the back, even when he looked up, even the top of his head also lit up, flashing the faint white light.</p>
<p>There are countless ghosts, as if waking up from a long sleep, feeling the warmth of the human body for the first time in hundreds of years, gathering here.</p>
<p>The white light like smoke drifted indefinitely and turned into countless faces, either male or female, or old or young, or beautiful or ugly. However, at this moment, there is only one feeling in Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s eyes: cold.</p>
<p>He was numb at the thought of the innumerable spirits swarming around him. Fortunately, after the initial horror, he soon found that these spirits seemed to be afraid of the fire stick in front of him, and they did not dare to approach the dark blue light of the fire stick. But before Zhang Xiaofan was relieved, the ghosts who were wandering in the middle of the sky seemed to find something, and they flew to Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s left side.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was stunned for a while, then he lost color. The soft hand he held in his left hand was getting cold. He quickly pulled hard, and a sound of water rang. Lu Xueqi was pulled to his side. With the light around him, Zhang Xiaofan saw Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s face was pale and her eyes were closed tightly, but his breathing was normal. After a rough look, she didn&rsquo;t seem to have any injuries. So he put down his mind and looked around and carefully observed the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>He and Lu Xueqi, who are in a coma, are at the edge of a bay of water. They can&rsquo;t see the size of the water in the dark, and they don&rsquo;t know whether it&rsquo;s a small pool, or a large lake, or the legendary huge deep underground sea. Zhang Xiaofan didn&rsquo;t know why he suddenly had this idea. However, when he was in the water, he felt that the water was not still. A wave of tides, like a gentle hand, caressed his body.</p>
<p>However, the water is really cool!</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan stood up difficultly, then stayed, even if he was not harmed by these spirits, he was afraid that the two of them would freeze to death in the water first. As soon as he stood up straight, he felt dizzy for a while and could not help shaking.</p>
<p>When he was on the platform, he was hit in the back by the eldest brother, the dog Taoist and Liu Hao at the same time. The injury was really serious. At the same time, the dark blue light of the fire staff seems to be inductive, and it is also dark for a while. Almost at the same time, the dim light of countless ghosts around lit up at the same time, and the faces of the illustrious adults revealed infinite desire.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was shocked. He quickly settled down, and the light of the fire stick came back on, shaking the spirits. Zhang Xiaofan laboriously pulls Lu Xueqi to the shore, but this short distance makes him feel so long.</p>
<p>Finally, they reached the hard ground. Zhang Xiaofan sat on the ground and gasped.</p>
<p>Around, countless ghosts are wandering outside the dark blue circle of the fire staff.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan stares at the wandering light, remembers the last memory in his mind before his coma, remembers Lu Xueqi flying over, holding his hand, remembering the endless dark abyss under them when they fell. He even vaguely remembers that before he lost consciousness, there was a familiar Buddhist name. On that platform.</p>
<p>That should be senior brother Faxiang. The four of them are here.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan read this sentence in his heart. With the help of four of them and the practice of Qihao and Zeng Shushu, it should be OK. If elder martial brother Qi is OK. Surely elder martial sister ling&rsquo;er won&rsquo;t be sad, will she?</p>
<p>But, however, Zhang Xiaofan almost asked himself at the same time, if I died, would elder martial sister ling&rsquo;er be sad? Maybe she&rsquo;ll be a little sad, too. After all, over the years, I get along with her day and night, knowing that this elder martial sister, who looks beautiful and strong, actually has a soft and weak side in her heart.</p>
<p>If she heard that younger martial brother Zhang Xiaofan, who played since childhood, died, would she shed some tears? Will it hurt you too? Must also be in the case of not finding the body, in the head of Dazhu peak for him to set up a grave?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how many times she will come to the grave in the future?</p>
<p>If so, will I be like the spirits around me, thinking about her. Not willing to die, only lingered in the grave, quietly looking forward to the memory of the figure.</p>
<p>The youth sighs in the silent darkness, low and unknown!</p>
<p>&ldquo;EH.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>She made a soft call, woke up slowly, and opened her eyes.</p>
<p>For thousands of years, there has been an ancient question: if you wake up after a long sleep, who will be the first person you want to see?</p>
<p>No one knows that Lu Xueqi has ever heard this seemingly boring question, and now. Reflected in her eyes is in the quiet white light, Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s concerned eyes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the only warmth in the dark!</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan looks happy. &ldquo;I wake up, elder martial sister Lu!&rdquo; said Xi</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi didn&rsquo;t answer immediately. She seemed to be in a daze, but soon she was back to normal, and her face was also confused from the beginning. Back to some cold frost. But as she looked around, she couldn&rsquo;t help but move again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ghosts!&rdquo; Just like Zhang Xiaofan, Lu Xueqi called out.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan nodded, comforted her and said, &ldquo;yes, but don&rsquo;t be afraid. They seem to be afraid of my burning and burning sticks. They should be OK for the time being.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the moment, Lu Xueqi also found that countless ghosts around him didn&rsquo;t rush up and just roamed around. It seemed that he was very afraid of Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s black short stick. When he settled down, he couldn&rsquo;t help saying, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s your magic weapon called? Why is it so powerful?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan blushed and said, &ldquo;call, call, I call it to do I don&rsquo;t know how it can be so powerful. &quot;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi said: &ldquo;fire stick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan looked at the woman in front of him in the dark white light. Her skin was like snow. Although she was pale, she was even more beautiful. She lowered her head and said, &ldquo;yes, I am in charge of cooking on the bamboo peak. I use it to make a fire stick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi said nothing for a while, and looked at the ugly black short stick in the middle of the air. For a while, he said in a low voice: &ldquo;fire stick! I have to be preached by my benefactor. I have to practice hard. I have the sword of heaven, but I was defeated by a fire staff. &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan suddenly felt that Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s face had turned white again in this moment, and he could hardly see any blood color. He couldn&rsquo;t help saying: &ldquo;elder martial sister, at that time, Chen won. Moreover, I heard that if it wasn&rsquo;t for Chen, he would have lost a lot of energy in the competition with me, and might not have lost to elder martial brother Qihao in the final&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The more he said it, the quieter it became, and then it gradually became silent. Only because Lu Xueqi looked up in silence and looked at him coldly, he could not speak any more. The faint white light shone on the two of them.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi lowered her head again and took a deep breath, saying, &ldquo;how can we get away with it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan stayed for a while, confused, and said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; Then I thought of something. I pointed my hand at the water and said, &ldquo;but when I woke up, we were both lying there. Would it be because we fell into the water by chance that we didn&rsquo;t die and were washed to the shore by the tide?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi looked in the direction he pointed out. Against the faint white light of the spirit, he saw the water in the distance, and the sound of &ldquo;sand&rdquo; came from the tide scouring the bank. On the other hand, although most of his clothes were dry, they were still wet and cold. It is conceivable that if Zhang Xiaofan had not pulled himself ashore, he would have been frozen to death before he was awake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you very much.&rdquo; Lu Xueqi suddenly whispered.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan stayed for a while, quickly waved his hand and said with a smile, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s OK, it&rsquo;s ok&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly, they both froze.</p>
<p>Between two people, between two hands. Until now, they still hold each other tightly.</p>
<p>It seems to be flesh and blood, as if it has been so many years, there is no sense. It seems that they should have been so, as if they both forgot!</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi slowly drew back her hand, Zhang Xiaofan smiled awkwardly, and put her hand left and right beside her, but she didn&rsquo;t know where to put it.</p>
<p>After a while. Or Lu Xueqi said, &ldquo;before you fell down, you were severely hit by the demons. How do you feel now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan, in case of amnesty, did not seem to blame him for listening to the ice woman, and said: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s OK.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi said, &ldquo;can you still control the sword?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan felt the pain in his body like a needle, smiled bitterly and shook his head.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi took a look at him and said: &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t either. Let&rsquo;s get up and look around to see if there is a way out. Otherwise, we will continue to do this all the time, surrounded by these evil spirits, sooner or later, we will be sucked to do it. &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan took a breath of cool air and nodded, &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi stood up and checked all over the body. There was no major injury. However, the Qi and blood in the internal meridians were a little disordered and the whole body was weak. It seems that it was due to the fight with mountain and river fans. The anti earthquake force was too strong. And she is most concerned about the Heavenly Sword. Now she was well back in the scabbard behind her.</p>
<p>She turned her head to look at Zhang Xiaofan again, but saw that he stood up with some difficulty. His figure was not very flexible, obviously still troubled by the injury. At the same time, I also know how much mental effort he took to pull himself out of the water just now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is your level of Taiji Xuanqing cultivation?&rdquo; Lu Xueqi suddenly said to Zhang Xiaofan.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was stunned for a while, but Lu Xueqi thought that he didn&rsquo;t answer intentionally. He turned around and said lightly, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s ok if you don&rsquo;t say it. But I heard that Shifu said that your cultivation was only at the fourth level. That day, it was all that strange magic weapon. I didn&rsquo;t believe it at that time. Today, I have seen with my own eyes that if you had not been a man of high cultivation and solid foundation of meridians, you would not have been able to stand up under those demons. &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan grabs the head and doesn&rsquo;t know what to say for a while, because he is confused about his practice at the moment, so he is vague. In fact, Lu Xueqi didn&rsquo;t know that Zhang Xiaofan had only the fourth level of cultivation, that is, he just could use the magic weapon. But in Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s body, there was another supreme Buddhist dharma &ldquo;great Brahma Prajna&rdquo;, which was the key to the fact.</p>
<p>In the past five years, Zhang Xiaofan has cultivated the great Brahma Prajna. Although his practice is still shallow, he has a solid foundation in the internal meridians. However, in his day and night practice of the two immortal dharmas of Buddhism and Taoism, he is far better than his younger brother who has the same practice. Because of this, he was hit by the demons of the demon sect. The Taiji Xuanqing road and the great Brahma Prajna were blocked by one layer, which made him lucky.</p>
<p>Then the two stood up, Zhang Xiaofan recalled the fire stick to his hand, and the dark blue light spread out to surround them. Lu Xueqi ponders and points to the opposite direction of the water, and they go to the endless darkness.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how long they have been walking in this direction. After a long time, they are still walking on the open space. Under the lifeless abyss, there is no sign of life except for the big surprise.</p>
<p>Yes, they just fly around them, clinging to the spirit of flesh and blood, floating silently up and down.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan and Lu Xueqi are both getting heavier and heavier. At the same time, they feel like a tide of Yin around them. At the moment, Zhang Xiaofan only feels that Qi and blood are surging and there are waves of dizziness. In fact, although he has a solid foundation, his accomplishments are not high after all. At the same time, he was hit by the elder brother, the wild dog Taoist and Liu Hao, which caused great damage to his internal meridians.</p>
<p>A moment later, Lu Xueqi also found that Zhang Xiaofan was not right. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with you?&rdquo; he said</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan forced a smile and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ok. Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi took a look at him and said, &ldquo;do you want to rest&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The word &ldquo;rest&rdquo; of her rest hasn&rsquo;t been said yet, but Zhang Xiaofan suddenly shakes and falls down. And the fire stick in his hand, along with his fallen body, quickly dimmed.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi was shocked and quickly helped him. His hands were cold. Zhang Xiaofan was stunned. At that moment, she, who has always been famous for her calmness among her disciples and sisters, was also a little flustered.</p>
<p>Then she thought of another, more terrifying question.</p>
<p>The fire stick is useless. What can I use to resist the countless ghosts around me?</p>
<p>Almost at the same time that Lu Xueqi thought about this problem, countless ghosts around seemed to be stunned. Then, in front of them, two living flesh and blood bodies stood there without any defense.</p>
<p>In the darkness, it seems that there are countless voices laughing and roaring proudly at the same time. Countless ghosts seem to freeze for a moment in the air. Then, they rush to these two helpless people standing in the dark like greedy beasts. (to be continued. )</p>
