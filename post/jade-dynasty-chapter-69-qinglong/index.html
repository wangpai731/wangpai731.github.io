      <p>At this time, someone had come to hold the old blood sucking demon. The bald old man seemed to have a lot of friendship with the old blood sucking demon. He came to him and asked him something in a low voice. The ghost king came out empty, smiling but speechless, with a relaxed expression and no sense of hostility at all. The white faced scholar standing next to him looked at him.</p>
<p>Cangsong said, do you remember your grandfather? &ldquo;Suddenly, a hoarse voice came.</p>
<p>The young disciples here frown together, but what they see is that fierce looking dwarf. At the moment, they only see him staring at Cangsong with fierce eyes, just like a wolf.</p>
<p>Cang song sneered and said, &ldquo;demon, do you remember that sword? &quot;</p>
<p>As soon as this speech came out, people saw the midget&rsquo;s face was twisted and gnawed, obviously hated it. But when he nodded slowly, and with his hand in his chest, he rowed obliquely from left shoulder to right, and said maliciously, &ldquo;OK, OK, I haven&rsquo;t forgotten, but I don&rsquo;t expect you to remember, that&rsquo;s great. This sword, of course, I will still be on you. &quot;</p>
<p>Cang song snorted and ignored him. His eyes turned to the two people who had been standing on one side and looked calm.</p>
<p>Su Ru&rsquo;s face is dignified. With her eyes, she can see that all these people are good at Taoism. They are not weaker than the old blood sucking demon just now. I&rsquo;m afraid that most of them are the old demons in the demon sect who haven&rsquo;t been born for a long time.</p>
<p>At the moment, hearing the conversation between Taoist Cangsong and the dwarf, Su Ru whispered, &ldquo;who are these people? &quot;</p>
<p>Tian was not easy to look good on his face. He frowned together and said, &ldquo;this dwarf is called baiduzi. He belongs to the ten thousand poisons sect of the demon sect. That bald old man is the ancestor of Duanmu in Jieshi mountain. He has always been unique in the demon sect. These two people and the blood sucking old demon are the remaining evils of the demon sect that we hunted a hundred years ago. To the two people nearby, one seems to be the leader of the ghost King sect of the demon sect, which Xiao Yicai said, but I have never seen the white faced scholar. &quot;</p>
<p>Su Ru took a breath of cool air. In the battle of Zhengmo a hundred years ago, she failed to practice, and did not go deep into the wilderness with Tian Changyi and Taoist Cangsong. But the names of these people were very similar. In particular, baiduzi and Duanmu ancestor are notorious, and they are better than the blood sucking old demon.</p>
<p>Just at this time, the balding Duanmu ancestor suddenly turned around.</p>
<p>He glanced at all the people in the right way and suddenly said in a sharp voice, &ldquo;ten thousand swords! Why didn&rsquo;t the dog thief come? &quot;</p>
<p>The young disciples of Qingyun sect are all shocked. They don&rsquo;t know what he said, but Tian Jianyi, Taoist Cangsong, Su Ru and others change their colors. It&rsquo;s not easy for Tian Lengleng to say, &ldquo;elder martial brother Wan has a profound way of doing things, which is connected with heaven. It has already emerged. Only the demons and clowns like you can bark here! &quot;</p>
<p>All the people in the demon sect were stunned. Baiduzi and Duanmu, including the old blood sucking demon who had just breathed slowly, lost their voice together and said, &ldquo;dead? &quot;</p>
<p>The ghost king and the white faced scholar standing on one side also seemed to shake slightly.</p>
<p>Wan Jianyi, a name that has never been heard in the ears of the young generation of Qingyun gate, seems to have magic power to these demon giants. I saw these people look at each other. There was a delicate look, especially hatred on their faces, mixed with a hint of fear, but they couldn&rsquo;t cover it. They had a joyful look in the bottom of their eyes.</p>
<p>Duanmu&rsquo;s face was complicated. He touched his bald head with his hand and murmured a few words. People didn&rsquo;t hear what he said, but the last one was quite clear: &ldquo;Hey, I didn&rsquo;t expect that the dog thief would die. Ha ha, ha ha, ha ha ha</p>
<p>He could not help laughing.</p>
<p>People here in Qingyun gate all changed their faces. Taoist Cangsong stared at him and suddenly sneered, &ldquo;what are you laughing at? Although he is not here. But under the Qingyun gate, there are many people who subdue the demons and subdue the demons to deal with the demons and clowns like you. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bah! &ldquo;There was a disdainful voice, but the one hundred poisons said,&rdquo; we can&rsquo;t kill this guy by ourselves. It&rsquo;s really hard to understand our hatred. Sooner or later, we will kill Qingyun, blow him to the bone, and let him die with no peace! &quot;</p>
<p>The old blood sucking demon cried out at the back, &ldquo;yes, just like this, otherwise it will be hard to eliminate my hundred years of hatred! &quot;</p>
<p>All the people in the right way have changed color. It&rsquo;s indignant to see that all the evil spirits of the demon sect are cruel and cruel, and even the people who have passed away have not let go of their words.</p>
<p>Tian ling&rsquo;er whispers to song Daren, the next elder martial brother, &ldquo;elder martial brother, who is Mr. Wan? He seems to be so powerful that even these demons are afraid of him. Why have we never heard of him? &quot;</p>
<p>Song Daren&rsquo;s face moved. He wanted to talk but stopped. He smiled bitterly and said, &ldquo;little sister, when you are free to go back to the mountain, please ask Shifu yourself! &quot;</p>
<p>Tian ling&rsquo;er took a sip of his mouth and snorted. He said slightly angrily, &ldquo;if you don&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;ll ask my mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said he would go forward.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan looked in his eyes and was in a hurry. He stretched out his hand to hold her and said in a low voice, &ldquo;elder martial sister, now the enemy is in the current situation, don&rsquo;t go up. Let&rsquo;s ask later! &quot;</p>
<p>Tian ling&rsquo;er looked at the front and saw that the atmosphere was really tense. He stopped and smiled back at Zhang Xiaofan.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s heart was hot, but suddenly there was a cold hum in front of him, full of anger, but on the other side of the demon sect. Zhang Xiaofan looked up and saw that after the ghost king, Biyao slowly appeared and stared at herself from afar.</p>
<p>Somehow, Zhang Xiaofan was shocked and unconsciously released his hand holding Tian linger.</p>
<p>In the distance, Lu Xueqi slowly takes back her eyes from Zhang Xiaofan and falls on the body of Biyao in front of her. She looks at her silently.</p>
<p>At this time, the great venerable, who has been frowning and silent, suddenly opened his mouth and said, &ldquo;baiduzi, Duanmu old demon, when you were lucky enough to get rid of it, you should change your mind and be a talent again. Today I dare to come out and make trouble, but I&rsquo;m impatient? &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bah! &ldquo;Those people swore together and said obscene things.</p>
<p>The great Reverend changed a little. Suddenly, the white faced scholar who had been standing beside him took a step and smiled, &ldquo;is this the great Reverend of the King Kong gate? &quot;</p>
<p>The great one looked at him and said, &ldquo;yes, who are you? &quot;</p>
<p>The white faced scholar smiled and didn&rsquo;t answer, but said to himself, &ldquo;if Wan Jian had stood here and said what you just said, we, the demons and clowns in your eyes, would have some scruples. But if you can use the magic of the tripods in the Vajra gate, you should hide behind the people in the Qingyun gate! &quot;</p>
<p>All the demons laughed. Even behind them, in the dark woods, there was a faint laugh.</p>
<p>The face of the great Reverend was red at once. He looks very angry, but the Taoist Cangsong of Qingyun gate beside him looks at Tian uneasy and Su Ru, but his eyes are worried. Only from the laughter, we can know that the demon sect has not only come to help. Even in terms of the number of people, there are many more.</p>
<p>This war, I&rsquo;m afraid, is extremely difficult.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bastard! &ldquo;A big drink, suddenly sounded, but the stone standing behind the great venerable jumped up. Unwilling to be humiliated, Shifu&rsquo;s wand of breaking the evil spirit was so golden that he rushed to the white faced scholar.</p>
<p>Tian not easy and others were shocked, and the great Reverend shouted, &ldquo;stone, come back, do not act rashly! &quot;</p>
<p>However, the stone suddenly got into trouble at a very fast speed. In a second, it broke through the evil golden light and rushed to the white faced scholar. However, the white faced scholar did not look flustered, only raised his right hand. There is a flash of blue light in the palm, which is facing the broken evil spirit staff.</p>
<p>In a flash, the golden light was broken like an arrow out of the way. It hit the palm of the white faced scholar&rsquo;s hand. In a flash, everyone saw the golden light flickering and the air was making a noise, but the white faced scholar could not be seen.</p>
<p>The young disciples in the middle of the right way were full of joy, but the Taoist Cangsong and Tian hard to wait for others, their faces sank.</p>
<p>A moment later. The golden light gradually dimmed, and everyone was mute. But the white faced scholar in the field was calm, and he only used one hand to resist the stone&rsquo;s powerful golden light. No matter how the stone moves in the midair, it can&rsquo;t move any more.</p>
<p>Only he smiled and said, &ldquo;young man, go back and Practice for another hundred years! &quot;</p>
<p>Then, with a strong wave of his right hand, they saw another flash of blue light. If the stone is hit hard, the whole person flies back, but the staff of breaking the evil spirit method rises to the sky and flies high after a sharp sound.</p>
<p>The great Reverend rises up and catches the injured stone. After a careful look, he knows that he has suffered some vibration and is not in any way affected. Then he gives up his mind. But his anger increases even more. As soon as he turns around, he will release his hand.</p>
<p>But suddenly a hand reached out and held him, but it was Taoist Cangsong. His face was frosty, and he said coldly, &ldquo;who is it, sir? How can this thousand year old light ring be in your hands? &quot;</p>
<p>The great one was stunned and lost his voice. &ldquo;What, heaven and earth light ring? &quot;</p>
<p>Eight of the ten people, including the demon sect, shrugged and moved. Zhang Xiaofan was curious and asked song Daren in a low voice, &ldquo;elder martial brother, is this magic weapon very powerful? &quot;</p>
<p>Song Daren, still stunned, nodded his head and whispered, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard from Shifu before that this ring is a powerful magic weapon, but it has been missing for thousands of years. I don&rsquo;t want to reappear in the world today! &quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan took a breath of cool air, only to hear the white faced scholar smile at Taoist Cangsong, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a nobody. Now I&rsquo;m a pawn under the leader of the ghost king. &quot;</p>
<p>The ghost King smiled and shook his head. &ldquo;Brother long, you are too modest.</p>
<p>&quot;</p>
<p>Standing beside baiduzi, Duanmu Laozu, and the blood sucking old demon who also came here at the moment, looked at the white faced scholar who was called &ldquo;brother long&rdquo; by the ghost King almost at the same time, but saw that his right hand was locked in his sleeve at the moment, and he could not see the goods in his hand at all. But I heard that Taoist Cangsong was so sure just now, and the white faced scholar didn&rsquo;t deny that most of them really owned this magic ring.</p>
<p>At the thought of all the miracles of this ring in the legend, all the people who practice the way are very serious about the magic weapon, and they are really full of fever. However, although the three of them appeared at the same time as the white faced scholar, they did not come from the same way and did not see this person. Only knowing that shortly after they arrived, there was such a profound Taoist beside the ghost king.</p>
<p>At that time, baiduzi looked at his right hand and turned to the ghost king and said, &ldquo;master of the ghost king, we have never seen this brother before, but we don&rsquo;t know when the ghost king came out so high? &quot;</p>
<p>The ghost King smiled and said, &ldquo;brother Baidu, our ghost King sect is a small sect of holy religion, which naturally can&rsquo;t compare with your ten thousand poisons sect. &quot;</p>
<p>Baiduzi snorted. He belongs to wandumen, one of the four major sects of the demon sect. This time he was entrusted by the sect leader to come to this remote place. Speaking of it, this is the first time he has been out of the mountain in 100 years.</p>
<p>However, he is still clear about the things in the demon sect: today&rsquo;s demon sect is led by four major sects. The Wandu sect, Hehuan sect and Changsheng sect are all the big sects that rose after the death of the black hearted old man 800 years ago, when the blood refining Hall fell down. They have a long history and are deeply rooted. However, the ghost King clan suddenly rose three hundred years ago, and the experts in the sect were springing up. It&rsquo;s amazing that we have shared the world of demon cult with the other three factions in 200 years.</p>
<p>In the demon sect, the forces are everywhere. All the major factions want to reach the time when the black hearted old man was there. The blood refining hall calls the wind and the rain. However, the forces of each sect are quite equal. Even many of the remaining small sects of demon sect are attached to each of the four sects. It&rsquo;s because although they are secretly intriguing, on the surface, they are also reluctant to keep their peace.</p>
<p>Before baiduzi came here. The leader of the ten thousand poisons sect told him personally that he must find an opportunity to spy on the ghost King clan. What&rsquo;s the secret? What is the strength? In the past few years, there has been a rumor in the world of the devil cult that the scripture &ldquo;the book of heaven&rdquo;, which is the supreme Scripture of the devil cult, has fallen into the hands of the ghost King clan.</p>
<p>At this moment, the &ldquo;heavenly book&rdquo; is not in sight, but the missing Millennium light ring suddenly appears, and baiduzi is shocked. I just think the strength of the ghost King&rsquo;s clan is immeasurable. But there was a smile on his face, but it was worse than crying. &ldquo;The Lord joked. Now who knows that the ghost King sect is in the ascendant, but we haven&rsquo;t seen this dragon brother before. We want to know him. &quot;</p>
<p>The ghost King took a deep look at baiduzi, his eyes were shining, and he suddenly smiled and said, &ldquo;brother Dao said that we will meet in the future. You should have known 300 years ago. Under the leadership of the previous generation of the king of ghosts, there are four holy emissaries in our king of ghosts clan, right? &quot;</p>
<p>As soon as baiduzi&rsquo;s face changed, Duanmu&rsquo;s ancestor lost his voice: &ldquo;what, green dragon and white tiger. Zhu Que and Xuanwu are still alive? &quot;</p>
<p>The white faced scholar and the ghost King smiled at each other and said, &ldquo;Hello, everyone, I am Qinglong. &quot;</p>
<p>On the other side of the right way, the reaction is not so fierce, but the people in the evil cult, such as baiduzi, shrug and move. Three hundred years ago. When the ghost King clan just rose, in addition to the previous generation of the ghost king, it was the so-called four holy envoys as the basic strength. In this regard, its power increased day by day. After several battles and clandestine fights in the demon sect, it has experienced countless bloody storms, and finally has today&rsquo;s situation. The strength of these four people can be imagined.</p>
<p>Qinglong suddenly sighed and turned to the ghost king, &ldquo;after all, he is still old. You can see that there are doubts on all the young people in the right direction. Most of them haven&rsquo;t heard my name. &quot;</p>
<p>The ghost king said with a smile, &ldquo;brother long, why worry more? The younger generation, see more than strange. As long as we take time, brother Long&rsquo;s name will be regained. &quot;</p>
<p>Qinglong laughed, and looked to his right hand in the laughter, as if there were still some faint sadness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bang&rdquo;, a loud sound, everyone was shocked. Looking at the sound, it turned out that it was the stone breaking staff that shot into the sky. It didn&rsquo;t fall down until now.</p>
<p>In the field, it was quiet for a while. On the right way, most people frowned and were alert. This time, the strength of the revival of the demon sect has exceeded expectations. In addition, there are more and deeper forces in the situation that are still hidden.</p>
<p>On the other side of the demon sect, however, there are still ghosts in each side. The Duanmu ancestor is better. He has no family and no school, but he is better than the blood sucking old demon, so he stands on his side. However, baiduzi and the blood sucking old demon are both important figures in the ten thousand poisons sect. At this moment, they look at each other speechless and are deeply wary of the ghost King clan.</p>
<p>Only the ghost king and the green dragon stood there calmly. The green dragon seemed to say something in a low voice. The ghost King smiled and shook his head, but seemed to look at Zhang Xiaofan inadvertently.</p>
<p>The night is getting deeper and deeper, the sea wind is howling, and in the vast sea in the distance, the sound of inexplicable long screams in the night seems to be getting closer and clearer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not easy for Tian to look at Taoist Cangsong, and all of them can see that there is a sense of retreat in the other side&rsquo;s eyes. Su Ru coughs and whispers to Cang song, &ldquo;elder martial brother Cang song, now that the evil is powerful, we&rsquo;d better stay away for a while, go back to the mountain and discuss with the elder martial brother, then make a decision, OK? &quot;</p>
<p>Cang song pondered for a while and nodded his head firmly, &ldquo;what younger martial sister said is. &ldquo;Then he took a look at Tian, who nodded slowly.</p>
<p>Taoist Cangsong was about to open his mouth. Suddenly he thought of something. He looked to the left and right, frowned, and whispered, &ldquo;what about xiaoyicai? Why didn&rsquo;t you see him all night? &quot;</p>
<p>Qi Hao, who was standing beside him, heard what he said and walked up one step: &ldquo;master, when I came out just now, elder martial brother Xiao said that he was not well, so he didn&rsquo;t follow me. &quot;</p>
<p>Taoist Cangsong&rsquo;s face sank and snorted, but he couldn&rsquo;t say anything in front of his disciples, so he turned around and was trying to talk to other sects, such as FA Xiang and Li Xun. Behind their crowd came a scream.</p>
<p>The crowd stirred up a confusion, only to see a few young disciples standing behind. Heavily wounded, he stumbled out of the darkness, covered with blood and hissed, &ldquo;there are demons in the back! &quot;</p>
<p>In the dark, in the old forest. As if there were countless shrill laughter, Tian could not wait for his face to change. Since the appearance of the ghost king and others, people&rsquo;s attention has been attracted by the old monsters in the past. Unexpectedly, people in the demon sect are crafty, but secretly they send people to cover the back road and suddenly get into trouble.</p>
<p>Only in this moment, the light in the forest is shining, and countless magic weapons are flying out to kill. People in the right way control the magic weapons to fight back, but they are surprised. Secondly, the disciples of the demon sect are far more than they think, and they are in the downwind.</p>
<p>Taoist Cangsong, with a gloomy face, took a big drink and rose from the air. Unexpectedly, before he could make any move, all the baiduzi and Duanmu ancestors in front of him rushed up together.</p>
<p>The hundred poisons laughed and looked fierce, and cried, &ldquo;Taoist dog, take your life! &quot;</p>
<p>Taoist Cangsong, with his figure in midair, dare not despise these old monsters.</p>
<p>He had to return to fight. At the same time, his red light was shining, but it was not easy for Tian to fight. He caught Duanmu.</p>
<p>Su Ru is standing underground. The brow is tight and wrinkled. There is some sadness on the beautiful face. At present, there are obviously disadvantages in the right way. There are two unpredictable ghost kings and green dragons who haven&rsquo;t fought in the demon sect, while the disciples of the demon sect in the dark don&rsquo;t know how many, and the situation is worrying.</p>
<p>The situation is in chaos. It seems that in the night and in the shadow, there are people in the demon sect everywhere. There will be magic weapons that kill people and kill people everywhere. People in the right way will fall into a bitter battle. People will hum and scream incessantly.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was holding a fire stick, but he didn&rsquo;t start. Song Daren and Tian linger of dazhufeng were worried that he had just been hurt and wrapped him in the middle, so they didn&rsquo;t get hurt for a while. However, the situation was critical and he was generally nervous.</p>
<p>Seeing that the light of the surrounding demons is more and more prosperous, the people in the right way are gradually compressed, mainly in the night, there is no hidden disciples of the demons, which is really a big loss.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan stood at the same place and saw that several senior brothers around him and Tian linger were also under increasing pressure. He was worried and felt that although he was a little tired, he didn&rsquo;t have any problem, so he had to go to the war.</p>
<p>At this moment, I just heard a light roar, such as the Phoenix crowing nine days, the pure sound is sweet, reverberating away. A brilliant blue light rises suddenly. Lu Xueqi rises with the sword, but the light of Tianya divine sword is so bright that it lights up the left and right circles.</p>
<p>The darkness seemed unable to get close to her face and figure!</p>
<p>However, she threw herself into the darkness and went to the sky with a &ldquo;shout&rdquo;. This beautiful woman, like an electric blue light, shot into the darkness of the ancient forest.</p>
<p>A moment later, I saw the blue light shining, the voice of surprise in the dark was heard, and the pressure of all the people in the field was suddenly lightened.</p>
<p>At the same time, just listen to the Buddha&rsquo;s horn array. The palms of the Dharma phase rise together. Above the fingertips, the &ldquo;reincarnation bead&rdquo; flashes the solemn golden light and turns slowly. Suddenly he opened his eyes, and the bead of samsara rushed to the other side of the darkness. A moment later, a dazzling golden light, in the dark, like the day, countless people in the demon sect flew out.</p>
<p>As a result, the situation immediately changed. For example, Qi Hao, Lin Jingyu, Li Xun, Yan Hong, even FA Shan, Shi and so on, are all outstanding figures in the younger generation of Zhengdao. Just now, they were just caught off guard. This time, they started to attack one after another. It seems that there were no experts in the surrounding evil cult, few of them could block their sharp edge, and the situation improved towards the right side.</p>
<p>The ghost king and Qinglong, standing in the distance, frowned in their eyes. Qinglong shook his head slightly and sighed, &ldquo;these young disciples in the right way have all the qualifications. They are much better than our younger generation. &quot;</p>
<p>The ghost King nodded and looked at the distance. Suddenly he said, &ldquo;you can see the magic weapon in the hand of the woman who first shot it? &quot;</p>
<p>The Green Dragon said lightly, &ldquo;is it Tianya? &quot;</p>
<p>The ghost king turned and looked at him. The green dragon smiled and whispered slowly, as if in a low voice, &ldquo;the God sword of Tianya, the God sword of Tianya! &quot;</p>
<p>The ghost king stood with his hand in his hand and said slowly, &ldquo;besides, the monk in Tianyin temple has reincarnation beads in his hand; the white boy in Qingyun gate has a green fairy sword like water, which should be a dragon cutting sword. In the past few years, we have been cultivating young people. (to be continued. )</p>
