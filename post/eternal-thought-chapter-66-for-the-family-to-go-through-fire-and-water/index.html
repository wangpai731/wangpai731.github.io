      <p>In the jungle, as he kept on moving forward, Bai Xiaochun gradually saw some clues. His guess was more certain until he got out of the mountain. A few days later, at this extreme speed, he returned to the Luoxing mountain range and found the Luochen family which had become a ruin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems that Du Lingfei and Hou Yunfei have indeed sent the news back to zongmen.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun recalled the previous tragic, full of regret, turned for a long time, the wind boat appeared, he jumped up and sat down, control the wind boat.</p>
<p>Call a sound, the boat into a rainbow, straight to the distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Back to the ancestral gate!&rdquo; White small pure eyes show expectations, he thought that he should now be to the zongmen made a lot of credit, this time back, the zongmen will be rewarded.</p>
<p>Thinking of this, he was even more excited. He looked down at the storage bag. Along the way, he sorted out the storage bag from the people of the Luochen family. There were a lot of things in it, and some spirit stones.</p>
<p>The most important thing was that he forgot who was in the bag. He found a fist sized seed, beating like a heart. It seemed to contain life, but it was volatilizing and becoming weaker and weaker.</p>
<p>After seeing it, Bai Xiaochun thought about it for a long time, and then he was surprised to recognize that it was an extinct and precious spirit species in the legend. Its name is breeding animal!</p>
<p>It is said that after absorbing the essence of the essence of animals, it can breed itself. For those fierce animals that can hardly leave their offspring, this breeding species is almost priceless.</p>
<p>Especially those friars who have strong spirit animals around them hope to obtain the offspring of spirit animals, but they often only own them individually. At this time, the value of breeding animal species is reflected again.</p>
<p>Although I don&rsquo;t know why this precious thing was in the hands of a certain people in Luochen who pursued and killed him, it can be imagined that each had his own creation. After all, the Luochen family lived in the Luoxing mountains, and the Luoxing mountains Full of mystery.</p>
<p>Moreover, he had been identified for a long time, so the Luochen people who obtained the breed should not have known it. Therefore, there are some problems in the preservation.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun chose some wood with aura all the way, cut it into a wooden box, and put the breed in it. The fluctuation of the breeding animal&rsquo;s life gradually stabilized.</p>
<p>Put the wooden box away, Bai Xiaochun took a deep breath, and controlled the wind boat. He roared in the sky, following the original road of the coming time, getting closer and closer to lingxizong.</p>
<p>A month later, because there were not many Lingshi, the three of them only took the boat at night. But now Bai Xiaochun didn&rsquo;t care about the cost of the stone. So it took only one month to see the gate on the South Bank of lingxizong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This time, I went back and forth for more than half a year, and finally came back.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun stood up on the wind boat, her hair flying, and put on the appearance of a peerless master. Then she suddenly remembered something. She felt that the expression was inappropriate, so she quickly changed into the tattered outer disciple&rsquo;s robe when fighting with the Luochen family.</p>
<p>It is very sad and miserable to look at death for the family. The bloodstained robe shows that every breach is a crisis of life and death.</p>
<p>Just then he felt satisfied and steered the wind boat forward. When he was close to the mountain gate, he was about to penetrate. Suddenly, an invisible barrier suddenly appeared, and in an instant, he would open the wind boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah?&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s body shook and almost fell.</p>
<p>At the same time, in front of him, a rainbow suddenly flew out of the Mountain Gate on the south bank. Inside the rainbow was a young man with a calm look. After walking out, he calmly looked at Bai Xiaochun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you? I don&rsquo;t know why you came to our Lingxi residence.&rdquo; The young man just said this, suddenly frowned, looked at the wind of the boat, and looked at Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s clothes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With my Lingxi clan&rsquo;s wind boat and the clothes of other disciples, I was blocked out by the mountain gate array! Who are you! &quot; The young man&rsquo;s eyes were full of cold light. When he pinched the formula with his right hand, he immediately turned out to be eight layers of condensate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elder martial brother, what&rsquo;s the matter? Why don&rsquo;t you let me in? I&rsquo;m Bai Xiaochun, a disciple of Xiangyun mountain.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun stepped back a few steps and looked at the scene. He was confused about the situation and spoke quickly.</p>
<p>The young man frowned and was about to speak when he was in a daze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you Bai Xiaochun?&rdquo; He looked at Bai Xiaochun carefully, and the more he saw it, the more familiar he felt. When he went to the funeral of Bai Xiaochun, he saw the portrait of Bai Xiaochun on the tombstone. At the moment, his body suddenly shook, especially the bloody clothes on Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s body, which made him gasp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You You&rsquo;re dead, aren&rsquo;t you</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not dead.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun was stunned for a moment, and the young man immediately looked excited. He took out the jade slips and immediately passed the letter to the sect.</p>
<p>When the news of Bai Xiaochun was introduced into the sect, Li Qinghou&rsquo;s closed eyes suddenly opened on Xiangyun mountain. His body trembled and suddenly walked out.</p>
<p>At the same time, the news spread to the leader, and the leader of Lingxi clan was stunned. But soon, his divine sense swept through the south bank Mountain Gate and saw Bai Xiaochun. He was surprised and then pleased and informed the whole clan.</p>
<p>Within the door, that is, the time of breathing, bursts of incredible sound suddenly came out, which could be heard even at the gate of the mountain. At the same time, the bell rang suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bai Xiaochun? Isn&rsquo;t he dead? Why is he alive again? &quot;</p>
<p>Then, countless figures roared out of the sect. Hou Yunfei, the most prominent figure in front of him, came quickly. When he got out of the mountain gate, he saw Bai Xiaochun with an unbelievable look. He had gone through the pursuit of the Luochen family. Although he was unwilling to admit that Bai Xiaochun would die, in fact, in his heart, he knew that no disciple could survive such a brutal pursuit.</p>
<p>At the moment, the whole person tears of excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Younger martial brother Bai!&rdquo; He laughed and his body came in an instant. He hugged Bai Xiaochun and was so excited that he couldn&rsquo;t speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elder martial brother hou&hellip;&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun blinked. At the moment, he understood that zongmen thought he was dead. He was very happy to see Hou Yunfei unimpeded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, let&rsquo;s go back to the ancestral gate!&rdquo; Hou Yunfei was excited and took Bai Xiaochun to the mountain gate. Under his leadership, Bai Xiaochun successfully entered the mountain gate. The young man behind him also followed him. When he looked at Bai Xiaochun, he was shocked. He personally participated in the extermination of the Luochen family. He saw the tragic battlefield and the corpses of the Luochen family members in the jungle. Bai Xiaochun came back alive It&rsquo;s a shock.</p>
<p>Almost in the moment when Bai Xiaochun stepped into the mountain gate, more figures came roaring from all directions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nine fat?&rdquo; Zhang daphou, heisanpang, and the other fat brothers in the office of miscellaneous servants are all excited and trembling at the moment. All of them come, especially Zhang daphou, who hugs Bai Xiaochun with tears.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, what he had done before was worth looking at in his heart.</p>
<p>At this moment, a rainbow comes. It&rsquo;s Li Qinghou in the rainbow. He looks at Bai Xiaochun in disbelief. There is a package in his arms, which contains white Xiaochun&rsquo;s bloody clothes.</p>
<p>He can be said to be the most understanding of all people, Bai Xiaochun encountered the crisis, how deadly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See you, Palmer!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun hurried forward and waited for Li Qing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Live, live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li Qinghou is usually steady, but at this moment he trembles unconsciously. His right hand is raised and placed on Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s head. His eyes are excited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is my home. I&rsquo;d like to go through fire and water for my family!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun held her head high and said in a loud voice. She threw her small sleeve deliberately, revealing blood holes in her clothes.</p>
<p>There are three peaks on the south bank. After seeing Bai Xiaochun from afar, they are all shocked by Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s bloodstained clothes.</p>
<p>Especially at the moment, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s words spread all over the world. After hearing this, everyone was shocked. When they looked at Bai Xiaochun, they felt that Is the real family Tianjiao.</p>
<p>Seeing more and more people coming, a woman&rsquo;s voice of crying with joy came from afar. It was Du Lingfei. She washed her face with tears every day these days, and the whole person was haggard to the extreme. At the moment, when people talked about Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s coming back, her mind suddenly hummed and turned and ran recklessly.</p>
<p>At the moment, seeing Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s figure, she has more tears. She hugs her and cries and laughs. She can&rsquo;t believe that everything is true, which makes her heart warm.</p>
<p>His men&rsquo;s consciousness was about to touch the place where he was up, but when he thought of so many people around him, he held back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elder martial sister Du, I said, as long as I have a breath of Bai Xiaochun, I will never let you get any harm.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun light mouth, raised his chin, a pair of arrogant appearance of the world, said this extremely numb words.</p>
<p>Du Lingfei, however, felt that her body was going to be soft after hearing this sentence. Deep in the tears in her eyes, there was deep feeling and thick honey.</p>
<p>Soon, even the figure of the law enforcement hall appeared. When the first person was Ouyang Jie, he was also shocked when he looked at Bai Xiaochun. His eyes showed a strong interest, especially the clothes on Bai Xiaochun and the words he had just said to Li Qinghou, which made him nod in secret.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bai Xiaochun, I&rsquo;m the law enforcement officer of Ouyang Jie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Bai Xiaochun heard the three words of law enforcement hall, he suddenly felt a tremor in his heart. He thought that he had made great achievements. So he continued to straighten up his chest and give his fist to Ouyang Jie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About the affairs of the Luochen family, you went to see the leader with me.&rdquo; Ouyang Jie&rsquo;s face showed a rare smile. His right hand raised to Bai Xiaochun. At once, a spirit fog appeared at Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s feet. With his body, he went away with Ouyang Jie.</p>
<p>Li Qinghou&rsquo;s eyes showed joy and turned into a rainbow to go with him.</p>
<p>As for the other disciples, seeing Bai Xiaochun leave at the moment, most of them slowly disperse in the bursts of exclamation and discussion. However, the news that Bai Xiaochun is not dead is spreading faster.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, the whole Lingxi clan almost knew about it. Some people were happy and others were worried. Qian Dajin trembled in his cave and his face showed fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn it, he didn&rsquo;t die!! How can you survive such a dangerous and tragic pursuit? &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t know that I arranged this mission for him Yes, he doesn&rsquo;t know&hellip; &quot; Qian Dajin&rsquo;s face was uncertain. At the end of the day, he sighed, worried about gains and losses.</p>
