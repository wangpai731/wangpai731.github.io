<p>Bai Xiaochun left Hou Yunfei&rsquo;s residence with emotion and went back to his yard. He looked at the sky and the earth. He first thought about the inheritance sequence, and then thought about those Xiuzhen families. He thought that the leader and elder martial brother were too overbearing. He could think about it for a second It seems that in this way, although they can not continue to receive gifts, can receive those, also do not have to return. [love to go to the small</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s not my fault. It&rsquo;s the law of the leader and elder martial brother!&rdquo; When Bai Xiaochun thought of this place, she felt comforted. She sorted out the gifts she had received these days. She went down the mountain in exchange for a large number of herbs needed to refine the second-order elixir. She returned to the medicine refining Pavilion and began to practice and refine medicine.</p>
<p>In fact, Zheng Yuandong didn&rsquo;t want to appear in front of Bai Xiaochun and those Xiuzhen families, but he was really shocked. The nine glorious disciples in front of Bai Xiaochun were all posthumous. Indeed, they were all members of the Xiuzhen family. Even if there were no descendants left, there were close relatives of the same family. Therefore, there were no current problems and they were all reasonable Zhang&rsquo;s became a family of glory.</p>
<p>And zongmen for such a family, will also give full protection, focus on cultivation.</p>
<p>But now, Bai Xiaochun is a living glorious disciple. At the beginning, the horror of this identity has not been reflected. However, with the passage of time, after the spread of half a year, many people, including Zheng Yuandong, have ignored a living glory seedling, which is a strong inducement to those Xiuzhen families. Confused.</p>
<p>When numerous Xiuzhen families arrived, Zheng Yuandong was just watching. In his opinion, Bai Xiaochun could choose any family, but he didn&rsquo;t expect that those Xiuzhen families were willing to let their female servants be maids, and they wanted only a blood descendant when they had only one bite of sangduo porridge.</p>
<p>He can imagine that once Bai Xiaochun does not agree enough, then In a few years, maybe there will be dozens of Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s descendants. According to the rules of the clan, the first generation of descendants of honoring disciples are all inner disciples, and everyone in the clan should be vigorously trained, and As a result, tens of hundreds of people will continue to spread their branches and leaves. There will be hundreds of Yaorong families. I&rsquo;m afraid that in a few hundred years, Lingxi clan will all belong to the Bai family The consequences are too serious.</p>
<p>And Bai Xiaochun is still alive. As long as he constantly lets his next generation appear, he will never end this nightmare for zongmen.</p>
<p>In order to do this, Zheng Yuandong held a Presbyterian meeting all night, and even submitted it to the supreme elder. All of them unanimously decided that Bai Xiaochun should not have any Taoist partners in a hundred years. Although this matter was domineering, Zheng Yuandong could not help it. He did not dare to gamble on Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s determination. He only hoped that Bai Xiaochun would grow up and mature after 100 years.</p>
<p>Time flies and a year goes by.</p>
<p>In the past year, Bai Xiaochun almost disappeared on the south bank. Few people saw him again. He spent all his time on refining medicine and practice. In the medicine refining Pavilion, he worked hard to refine the second-order elixir.</p>
<p>Without knowing it, his cultivation gradually improved to the middle of the seventh layer of condensate gas. With his hard work, he gradually solved one after another of the problems in the refining of the second-order elixir.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, he thought that he could make the second grade medicine by changing other medicine apprentices. But here, he had a kind of paranoid persistence. He would never open the next furnace until he solved all the problems.</p>
<p>Finally, on this day a year later, he felt that in addition to different second-order elixirs, he had different problems that needed to be solved temporarily. On the basis of the second-order elixir, he finally opened another stove.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ziqi shenglingdan&rdquo; With blood in his eyes, Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s second-order elixir is suitable for condensing gas below eight layers, which is exactly what he needs now. At the moment, he takes out all kinds of plants and plants, arranges them skillfully, and constantly throws them into the furnace.</p>
<p>At the same time, he controlled the ground fire and observed the furnace, sending out aura from time to time. After three hours, the whole furnace vibrated violently, and a smell of medicine spread instantly. Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s eyes brightened. He quickly got up and went to the stove, patted the stove, and immediately three red pills flew out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s done!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun is excited. She grabs the three pills, but she is stunned when she looks at them. She whispers and observes carefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Ziqi shenglingdan. According to the prescription, it should be purple. How can I make it red?&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun scratched his head and took it to his nose to smell it. The medicine had a strong fragrance and aura. There was a faint smell. The color was wrong. He didn&rsquo;t dare to try to swallow it.</p>
<p>In his meditation, Bai Xiaochun carefully recalled the refining process before, until an hour later, he suddenly opened his eyes and began to laugh bitterly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the Danube flower was put in, the pollen of that Danube flower, a little more, was contaminated with other herbs, forming some strange changes.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun put three red pills aside and refined them again.</p>
<p>This time, as the furnace vibrates, the smell of medicine appears, and a purple pill flies out. After Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s careful identification, she looks satisfied.</p>
<p>So he turned on the stove again and refined it for several days. After all, he took out the three red ones when he took a rest. After all, each of them was worth a lot of money. Now he spent almost all his plants.</p>
<p>&ldquo;According to the saying of refining medicine, as long as a pill is made, it is even a miraculous medicine. The three red purple Qi rising miraculous pills have changed their color due to the increase of Danube pollen. I don&rsquo;t know what their effects are.&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun hesitated, left hand a pat storage bag, immediately appeared a needle in the hand.</p>
<p>The needle is blue and is a bamboo needle.</p>
<p>This is what Bai Xiaochun needs to have when refining medicine from his family. He can simply judge whether the miraculous medicine is harmful to human beings. He slowly stabbed the bamboo needle into the red pill. After a while, when he took it out, the bamboo needle was as usual and did not blacken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No poison!&rdquo; Bai Xiaochun breathed a sigh of relief, but still cautiously did not take, took the pill, left the refining medicine Pavilion, at the moment it was morning outside, he was walking on the path of zongmen.</p>
<p>In the sky, there are also a group of colorful Phoenix birds flying gracefully, sending out bursts of crisp calls. Bai Xiaochun ignores those birds and asks for a Lingwei chicken at the place where the chicken is raised. After returning to the courtyard of the residence, he takes out a red pill and throws it forward and puts it on the ground in front of the chicken.</p>
<p>Lingwei chicken was originally wilting, but when he saw the red pill, his body suddenly trembled and stood up without any hesitation. He pecked at the pill without hesitation.</p>
<p>But at this time, all of a sudden, there was a strong cry in the sky, suddenly came, the wind swept, the spirit tail chicken had not yet pecked the pill, the body was swept aside by the wind.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun was startled and quickly stepped back. When she saw the colorful Phoenix birds that had passed by from the sky, they all went straight to here one by one. On the way, they were fighting with each other. Soon, there was a male bird which was obviously stronger than others. In a flash, he pecked at the pill and swallowed it violently.</p>
<p>After eating, he looked contemptuously at the Lingwei chicken which was rolled up on one side. The Phoenix flew gracefully. Bai Xiaochun couldn&rsquo;t laugh or cry, but then his eyes were staring out and staring at the sky.</p>
<p>I saw the bird flying out of the air gracefully. All of a sudden, the bird&rsquo;s body trembled and screamed. Its eyes turned red. Countless blood threads spread in an instant, and the whole body hair stood upright, as if there was a fire in the body.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more amazing is that this male bird&rsquo;s muscles are swollen. Under the click, the whole body is twice as big as before, especially at the abdomen feather between the two claws. At this moment, a hard stick appears</p>
<p>The male bird&rsquo;s eyes were not right, and he suddenly looked at the other birds around.</p>
<p>All around, the birds trembled one by one. Just as they were about to disperse, the male bird jumped up in a moment like a maniac. Then, there was a shrill cry, which suddenly came out.</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun was stunned and took a breath. Standing in the yard, he was staring at the scene in the sky. He saw with his own eyes that the swollen bird was taking all the other birds Ravaged for some time, finally still red eyes, whole body seems to be angry, straight to him here come.</p>
<p>Frightened, Bai Xiaochun quickly retreats and almost screams.</p>
<p>Fortunately, he found that the bird did not rush to himself, but grabbed the chicken with the spirit tail</p>
<p>For a long time, Bai Xiaochun watched the male Phoenix whining all the way to the top of the mountain. He wiped his forehead with cold sweat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s terrible What kind of pill is this Bai Xiaochun looked down at the remaining two pills of pills and felt that her heart was trembling. She guessed that these two pills should be similar to hair. The effect of love pill is obvious This effect is not generally good.</p>
<p>This day is unforgettable for the disciples of Xiangyun mountain</p>
<p>Because the whole Xiangyun mountain, all the birds, no matter what they were, were trampled by a crazy phoenix of elder Zhou In front of countless disciples, they all saw the bird scream with their own eyes and tried to escape from the devil&rsquo;s paw. However, it was not as powerful as elder Zhou&rsquo;s Fengniao, and could not escape the poisonous hand</p>
<p>Even the evil Phoenix, even the spirit tail chicken, let alone the other birds raised by elder Zhou, all the way up and down the mountain, as long as there are wings On this day, it&rsquo;s like a nightmare.</p>
<p>All the disciples were talking about it. Seeing what happened, everyone trembled. Even ziding mountain and Qingfeng mountain heard the news, and even many people came to watch curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you heard that a phoenix kept by the perimeter of Xiangyun mountain is crazy. When it sees a bird, it pours&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw with my own eyes that the Phoenix is so ferocious that even the Magpies passing by are not allowed to pass by&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did elder Zhou do to make the Phoenix like this&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s disgusting. I also saw the Phoenix, which seemed to be extremely excited. Some birds were attacked by it again and again. It was miserable!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bai Xiaochun walked in the door, heard countless people talking in a low voice, his heart trembled, he was guilty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t blame me, it really doesn&rsquo;t blame me I was going to give it to Lingwei chicken It was the bird that took it by itself Bai Xiaochun was aggrieved and went to the refining medicine Pavilion. No one should know about it.</p>
<p>In the refining medicine Pavilion, he sighed and took out the two red pills, thinking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This pill is so powerful that it may become a killer for me In the future, I will not be afraid of fierce animals. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you want to use it as an assassin&rsquo;s mace, you need to refine a pill that can emit a strong female flavor.&rdquo; In Bai Xiaochun&rsquo;s mind, he fantasizes the picture. When he meets a fierce beast, he throws it out directly. If he throws the other one in another place, he can lead the fierce beast away.</p>
<p>So the heart was moved, but there was no prescription for this pill. He thought hard, and all the knowledge of plants and plants appeared in his mind. He searched one by one and prepared to create a prescription by himself.</p>
<p>When Bai Xiaochun was trying to create a prescription in the medicine refining Pavilion, Zhou Changlao, on the top of Xiangyun mountain, came back from home. He was staring at most of the birds in front of him. Not far away, the male Phoenix was pressing on the body of a spirit tailed chicken, constantly crying.</p>
<p>The old man felt his brain roar and his whole body trembled, as if the earth and the earth were spinning, and sent out an earth shaking roar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who did it!&rdquo;</p>
