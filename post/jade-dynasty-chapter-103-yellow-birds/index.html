      <p>The trunk shakes even more. Even this incredible tree, under the huge body of black water snake, seems to be shaking.</p>
<p>It seems that it is an evil beast from ancient times. The black water black snake wraps its huge body around the trunk of the tree. Where it passes, its branches and leaves are in a mess, and the vines and flowers are withered and broken one after another. It wags its head and wags its tail to move forward. The people in front of it are just like ants at the moment, not worth mentioning.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s face was pale slightly. When she stepped forward, she still stared at the ancient giant beast that was getting closer and closer. She whispered to Zeng Shushu, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu saw the sweat on his forehead and said: &ldquo;just now when we were below, we suddenly met this terrible beast. We only have the share to run in this way. But it didn&rsquo;t seem to care about us at that time. It was just looking for something. It left soon. I didn&rsquo;t expect that it would climb up unexpectedly. &quot;</p>
<p>Everyone looked at each other. Although all the people in the room were people who had achieved accomplishments in the cultivation of Taoism, which was far beyond the comparison of ordinary people in the world, their manpower was exhausted from time to time. Especially in front of this horrible giant beast, any resistance was ridiculous.</p>
<p>At the moment when the black water Xuan snake was getting closer and closer, the Golden Vase suddenly said, &ldquo;no, I&rsquo;m afraid this beast came for the things in the treasure house of the emperor of heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everyone changed color for a while.</p>
<p>The ghost frowned slightly, his face was expressionless, but suddenly he thought that when he just entered the miasma wall of zeneze, he had encountered a huge animal which was so big that he could not see it clearly because of the miasma. However, from then on, he was familiar with the peculiar smell around him. Now it seems that the black animal he met that day was the same Water snake.</p>
<p>Looking at the black water snake moving forward, the huge black body shakes the trunk, almost worrying whether the trunk will be crushed by it. In the middle of the sky, the huge snake head is under the tusks. The bright red bifurcated tongue is constantly stretching in the air, toward the direction of the far away treasure house of the emperor of heaven, with a soft roar, as if excited.</p>
<p>Now. Everyone has seen that the purpose of this giant beast is indeed the thing behind them in the imperial treasure house that day.</p>
<p>Guili looks back and looks at the treasure house of the emperor.</p>
<p>The thick stone gate is still motionless. Originally, it only shines on the sunshine in the flower sea in front of the stone gate. Now it has moved to the gate. The four ancient seal characters of &ldquo;Tiandi treasure house&rdquo; are shining in the sun.</p>
<p>FA Xiangyan looks at the huge snake&rsquo;s body getting closer and closer like a hill. With a sigh, he quickly turns to other people and says, &ldquo;this black water snake is an ancient Warcraft. It&rsquo;s not a human enemy. We&rsquo;re not its opponent. Let&rsquo;s not be strong. Let&rsquo;s go. &quot;</p>
<p>In fact, everyone knows that Zeng Shulin, Jingyu and others nodded, and the gold bottle hummed. Obviously, it was the eldest brother&rsquo;s unwillingness, but she was ready to leave.</p>
<p>All the people in the arena have mastered the magic weapon and are ready to walk around. Meanwhile, ghost Li slowly lights up the dark blue light at his hand. He is about to call back the little ash still hiding near the stone gate, just at this time. All of a sudden, there was a dull roar from the stone gate of the emperor&rsquo;s treasure house.</p>
<p>At this moment, it is the sunshine in the sky. It is on the top horizontal of the word &ldquo;heaven&rdquo; in the ancient seal script of the four characters &ldquo;the treasure house of the emperor of heaven&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roar!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Almost at the same time, the black water Xuan snake suddenly accelerated its speed, and quickly climbed up with a roar in its mouth. Everyone was shocked for a moment. Jin Ping&rsquo;er, Zeng Shushu, Lin Jingyu, FA Xiang and others first flew up.</p>
<p>In the air, the smell is strong. I don&rsquo;t know where the strong wind blows. It blows like a knife.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, the spirit and the body sprang back and flew towards the treasure house of the emperor of heaven. At this moment, the Dharma phase and other people who were already in the middle of the sky were shocked. Looking back, they saw that the black water Xuan snake was furious, its huge eyes were wide, and its mouth seemed to have some black air blowing out. The huge snake body kept twisting, and in a twinkling of an eye, it was in front of the treasure house of the emperor of heaven.</p>
<p>In front of the human beings, the huge stone gate, the treasure house of the emperor of heaven, seems to be only the size of the snake head of the black water black snake.</p>
<p>The ghost li man was in the middle of the sky. He felt that the darkness behind him suddenly came down. The darkness like a mountain rushed towards him. He didn&rsquo;t need to look back. He also knew that the huge body of black water black snake was behind him.</p>
<p>He turned into a green light, flying like electricity towards the stone gate in front of the giant beast.</p>
<p>In front of me, the little gray monkey screams!</p>
<p>A dark shadow smashed down. The huge wind was so fierce that it had blown the ghost&rsquo;s body away before it touched the body.</p>
<p>Ghost Li was shocked in his heart, but he was not that young man who was in the dead spirit abyss. He immediately moved with his mind, as if he had eyes behind his back, to resist the attack of the soul from the body of the black water black snake, and to hide from time to time.</p>
<p>At this moment, the sound on the stone gate of the Tiandi treasure house is gradually high, accompanied by a roar. Under the sunlight, the originally complete huge stone gate suddenly cracks a gap in the middle, and then slowly moves to the side.</p>
<p>The golden and dazzling light came out of the gap. Even in the daytime, it was so brilliant that it could not be forced to stare. Even the rising sun in the sky seemed to be dim at the moment.</p>
<p>As if there was something roaring in the treasure house of the emperor of heaven, roaring in the golden light!</p>
<p>The whole body of the black water Xuan snake suddenly stretched straight, and made a loud roar, ignoring other things. The huge snake head rushed directly to the stone gate of the Tiandi treasure house.</p>
<p>But in the middle of it and the stone gate, the blue light seems to be a step earlier than it, and it is about to enter the treasure house of heaven</p>
<p>If there is no such a sword as bright as autumn water.</p>
<p>A blue light curtain, unexpectedly did not know when to arrive on the ghost Li&rsquo;s head, agglomerates into the huge lightsaber, splits to him. The red light in the eyes of GUI Li is very bright, and the stone gate is in front of him. But if the bright sword can&rsquo;t resist, he is afraid that it will be cut into two sections on the spot. As a result, the green light will reverse. Facing the sky, the blue light will come up. In the black shadow behind him, he will crash violently, and the shapeless wave will fly out to all sides. Even the golden bottle flying in the middle of the sky can&rsquo;t help but change Color.</p>
<p>Although the power is huge, it has no influence on the black water Xuan snake and the strange golden light in the treasure house of the emperor of heaven. The golden light is still dazzling, more and more prosperous, and the black water Xuan snake also rushes over. This man and woman, in the dangerous state of dramatic changes on both sides, are still struggling to support, and no one is willing to give up a little.</p>
<p>Until, each magic weapon&rsquo;s light has covered them. Their faces are becoming paler and paler, but most of all, there is a huge black shadow in the moment of this lightning flint. Rushed to the front.</p>
<p>The magic weapon of human cultivation arouses its own power and disappears under the exciting collision of black water snake.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi and GUI Li fly out at the same time. GUI Li only feels that his chest Qi and blood are turbulent.</p>
<p>There is a buzz in my mind. The whole body&rsquo;s meridians are almost completely turned over by the strong shock of the black water Xuan snake. One mouthful of blood is stuck in my chest. If it&rsquo;s not for the &ldquo;great Brahma Prajna&rdquo; of the Tianyin temple in my body at the moment to protect the heart vessels, and at the same time, I&rsquo;m in a hurry to stop the external forces layer by layer, just in case of bleeding on the spot.</p>
<p>But Rao is so, he still feels sharp pain all over his body. He doesn&rsquo;t know how many bones are broken. He is in the air. Suddenly he forced his head to look at Lu Xueqi.</p>
<p>That cold woman, at the moment, seems to be even worse. She is dressed like a snow-white, with blood stains on her chest, pale cheeks and lips, and blood overflowing constantly. It seems that she spits blood on the spot.</p>
<p>Although the green cloud sect is wonderful, it is in the aspect of strengthening the heart and protecting itself. However, the Brahma Prajna of Buddhism is better.</p>
<p>The righteous people who stayed in the middle of the air were stunned. This only happened in a moment. Before they could react, Lu Xueqi stopped them. A moment later, they were hit by the black water black snake at the same time. I&rsquo;m afraid they were all badly hurt.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi is a disciple of Qingyun. Needless to say, GUI Li was Zhang Xiaofan at the beginning. He had a deep relationship with all the people present. In response to this drastic change, all the people immediately flew down. Although they could not block the black water black snake, the ancient Warcraft, they always hoped to help them.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Golden Vase also flew down from the other side, but under the shadow of the black water Xuan snake, her wonderful eyes only stared at the brilliant golden light in the stone gate of the emperor&rsquo;s treasure house, which was shining.</p>
<p>In the distance, the rising sun is higher.</p>
<p>In the sunshine, the word &ldquo;Tian&rdquo; moved up a little bit from the horizon of the treasure house of the emperor of heaven.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the stone gate, which was about half three feet wide, suddenly stopped moving. A moment later, it began to close, and the golden light in it gradually faded.</p>
<p>The whole body of the ghost and Li is about to split, but they are still awake with Lu Xueqi. However, the collision force of the black water black snake is too strong. He can&rsquo;t control himself in a hurry. He is about to crash into the hard and thick stone gate. At this moment&rsquo;s speed, even though he has three real dharmas of Buddhism, Taoism and demons to protect himself, he is afraid to crash into pieces.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more terrible is that the stone gate is closing in the muffled sound</p>
<p>In the distance, as if in the middle of the sky, came the exclamation of Lin Jingyu and others!</p>
<p>In that moment, there was a trance: faintly, like a woman in green clothes, smiling at herself under the blue sky. Just, her smile, somehow, was a little fuzzy.</p>
<p>Time, in this moment, seems to slow down suddenly.</p>
<p>His body was turning in the air, and he saw the ferocious black water snake coming from behind, the hard stone door gradually closing in front of him, and the woman in white who was wandering in the air like himself.</p>
<p>He suddenly wanted to ask Lu Xueqi: for what, she would not hesitate to risk losing her life, but also to stop herself?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Squeak, squeak!&rdquo; As if it was a sudden scream in his ear, the voice of little grey monkey woke him up. Little grey didn&rsquo;t know when to run to the gap of the stone gate. He kept jumping and screaming. Now, the distance between the gaps of the stone gate is less than two feet.</p>
<p>Looking at it, it will hit the stone gate.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to finish my life.</p>
<p>See, blue sky and white clouds, all to their own pressure down.</p>
<p>If, give up</p>
<p>He bit his teeth, used his last strength, and turned his body around for a few minutes. In a moment, he saw the gap in front of him.</p>
<p>Maybe, you can get out of the way?</p>
<p>He breathed a sigh of relief. The whole man seemed to be dying. He had no strength.</p>
<p>The wind was cold, but he suddenly felt that someone was watching him.</p>
<p>He raised his eyes.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi didn&rsquo;t know when she was awake. Right beside him, looking at her flying direction, she must have hit the hard stone door. However, for some reason, it was on the face of this gorgeous woman. There was no fear.</p>
<p>In this moment of rotation, in this moment of life and death, she could not help flying to death, but. There was no sadness or fear in her face.</p>
<p>As if it were a night&rsquo;s Epiphyllum, in the red blood dotted with her figure, in the distant scream of horror. In front of Guili, no, Zhang Xiaofan, she suddenly smiled.</p>
<p>The pale smile has never appeared gentle, in such a cold wind, her lips gently open and close, staring at the people around her.</p>
<p>There are four words, through the wind, through the blood, more like through the years of time. In ten years, he lingered gently, then, lingering in his ear, echoing in his deep heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You, come back&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>She closed her eyes, and her body seemed to sink suddenly. She looked and wanted to leave him, just like the last strength, which disappeared with the completion of the four words.</p>
<p>Black hair fluttered. In the wind slightly covered the side of her white face, the woman floated with the wind, the corners of her mouth, but it seems that there is a faint smile.</p>
<p>But what is it. Reverberating in the deep heart so intense agitation? Like the surging flood that breaks down all the obstacles, all the things in the world can disappear, but at this moment, the white figure,</p>
<p>How can I give up?</p>
<p>How can we give up?</p>
<p>There was a low, hoarse roar in his throat, and he struggled in the inexplicable tears. In the fierce wind, he struggled, stretched out his hand, stretched out his hand, stretched out his hand</p>
<p>Hold on, hold on!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like ten years ago, beside the abyss of death, in the rain of countless stones, the woman in white came to him recklessly and seized his hand.</p>
<p>Hold on, hold on</p>
<p>He pulled the woman to himself with all his strength before his last consciousness disappeared.</p>
<p>In front, there is only a foot gap between the stone doors, and the golden light in the stone doors has completely disappeared at the moment, leaving only darkness.</p>
<p>There is a touch of warmth in his palm.</p>
<p>He closed his eyes, the boundless darkness, like ten years ago, drowned them and swallowed them.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Stone gate, slamming shut, at that last moment, the monkey ash also with the master rushed in.</p>
<p>Then, the huge stone gate closed again in the loud noise, and the gap in the middle disappeared unexpectedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boom!&rdquo; The huge snake head of black water Xuan snake smashed on the stone gate. The huge force was like a mountain falling into the sea. The trunk of dozens of Zhang thick and thin giant trees was shaking violently, as if it was about to break.</p>
<p>The black water black snake seems to see the delicious food flying to its mouth, falling into an uncontrollable rage, and the huge snake head begins to hit the stone gate crazily, which is so powerful that even the people in the middle of the sky in the distance change color.</p>
<p>The Golden Vase son flies away from the black water Xuan snake and curses in her heart. Just now, she followed the black water Xuan snake in the shadow of the other side to get close to the emperor&rsquo;s treasure house. She wanted to enter the treasure house by chance, but the scene suddenly turned down. That day, the emperor&rsquo;s treasure house closed again.</p>
<p>Jinpinger came a little late, angry, but unable to do it. At the moment, under the fury of the black water black snake, his attention began to turn to all the people in the sky. When jinpinger saw that the beast looked up, he hurriedly retreated dozens of feet.</p>
<p>Sure enough, the black water Xuan snake suddenly opened its mouth wide and spewed out a black venom to all the people in the sky. The smell of it made them vomit. All the people in the right way tried to avoid it. For a while, they were in a bit of a mess. The gold bottle hid faster and was calm. But looking at the black water snake under his feet roaring furiously, he then tried his best to hit the stone gate of the emperor&rsquo;s treasure house with his head. He thought that today, if he could not get any more cheapness, he would wait for a while. On the contrary, all the people in xiangzhengdao were hostile to him. It was better to go.</p>
<p>In such a way, jinpinger left here quietly and flew to the road to come, but she didn&rsquo;t fly far. Suddenly, she was shocked, and only saw on the road to come. The place where the black water black snake just passed was in a mess, but somehow, there was a vine garden, which was intact. In this garden, under the sunlight, it seemed that there was a dark red light flickering quietly, The arrangement is disorderly, but it seems to be mysterious after a close look.</p>
<p>Jinpinger frowned a little and looked at it carefully for a moment. Suddenly, his eyes flashed a fine light. It seemed that he saw something. Then he looked around quickly. At the same time, he sneered and whispered, &ldquo;even they are here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She pondered for a moment in the middle of the air, and finally shook her head and flew away.</p>
<p>Before the treasure house of the emperor of heaven, the rage of the black water Xuan snake was still raging, and it hit the stone gate desperately. The people in the middle of the sky wanted to sneak down to see if they could rescue Lu Xueqi and Lu Xueqi. However, they would be attacked by the black water Xuan snake a little closer. Several times, they nearly hurt the giant beast.</p>
<p>After several times of distress, FA Xiang beckoned to others to stay away, gathered together, and then whispered: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not the way to go on like this. I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s in the treasure house, which makes the beast so obsessed. With it here, we can&rsquo;t get into the treasure house in any case. &quot;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu&rsquo;s face is grim. He stares at the black water snake below. Zeng Shushu is worried, but even though he is smart, he can&rsquo;t do it now.</p>
<p>At the time when people were very anxious, there seemed to be only the crazy roar of black water snake left between heaven and earth. Just then, suddenly, the sky darkened.</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu and others all jumped. Just a moment ago, it was still clear here. How could it change the sky in an instant? I couldn&rsquo;t help looking up.</p>
<p>At this time, they were stunned. Nine days later, suddenly a large orange color appeared slowly, several tens of feet around, covering their heads, even blocking the sun.</p>
<p>Then, it seemed that there was a clear roar of the Phoenix in the sky.</p>
<p>Just now, the crazy black water snake suddenly stopped moving. The huge snake looked up and then seemed to be angry. He opened his mouth, exposed his tusks and roared at the cloud.</p>
<p>The cloud covered the sky and generally fell down. Although it was not as huge as the black water snake, it was similar to it.</p>
<p>In the distance, people can see clearly that this is a big bird with orange feathers. It spreads its wings and flies in the air. Instead of fearing, it seems to attack the black water snake sitting on the tree trunk.</p>
<p>In the face of this strange bird, the black water Xuan snake even put away its indescribable attitude, curled up, hissed its head and waited for it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This one is the legendary nine heavenly bird - yellow bird!&rdquo;</p>
<p>FA looks at the two giant animals in the distance and mumbles.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Note 1: this allusion is taken from the book of mountains, seas, great wasteland, South, Wushan and huangniao: there are Wushan people and huangniao in the West. Imperial medicine, bazhai. The yellow bird is in Wushan, which is in charge of the mysterious snake.</p>
<p>Note: the emperor is the emperor of heaven. The medicine refers to the immortal medicine, that is, the immortal medicine. The black snake is the black water black snake. (to be continued. )</p>
