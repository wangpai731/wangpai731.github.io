      <p>All of them, hold their breath.</p>
<p>The figure, submerged in a huge white column of light, disappeared.</p>
<p>The woman in white standing in the cloud may be over exerting! It was also a stumbling, no longer able to maintain balance, slowly fell down.</p>
<p>But, but, where is the sudden laughter?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so desolate, but extraordinary!</p>
<p>In the white light column, red as blood, the man was soaked in blood, like a maniac general, but out, looking up to the sky and howling.</p>
<p>It was dark.</p>
<p>Scattered hair, broken clothes, spray of blood like fog general, only blood phagocytic beads as bright, lit up the whole night sky.</p>
<p>He looked up and glared straight up.</p>
<p>The wind is cold and bloody. Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s face is as white as snow, and there is no trace of blood. Looking at the coming figure, subconsciously Tianya stabbed out.</p>
<p>Blue light, twinkling of an eye piercing blood fog, in front of his body.</p>
<p>The wound was in front of her.</p>
<p>Tianya trembles!</p>
<p>That look, deep, crazy but so familiar.</p>
<p>Still remember, many years ago, once desperate youth</p>
<p>Red Mansions skyrocketed, drowning the two figures.</p>
<p>Ghosts cry, the sky howls.</p>
<p>People in the right way exclaimed and scrambled to fly. But before they react, there is another strange white shadow, such as the electric fly.</p>
<p>In the red awn, the palm covered with blood, like the claws of a demon&rsquo;s ferocious smile, came to her.</p>
<p>However, Tianya was quietly and powerless.</p>
<p>She stood alone in the wind and rain, facing him, gazing silently.</p>
<p>Bloody palms, pressed on her lapel, roared with fierce Demon power.</p>
<p>The eyes that became crazy and blood red were right in front of her.</p>
<p>Whose heart is beating gently</p>
<p>Red light scattered, a figure. Fall down.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi stood in the air, closed her eyes, and there was a red blood mark on her skirt. see the scene which is dreadful to one &rsquo;s mind.</p>
<p>After the storm, can there be tears</p>
<p>A moment before the man in the right way, the sudden white shadow snatched the unconscious ghost, holding him to move horizontally, it was Xiaobai.</p>
<p>She looked at the fierce wound. Frowning, shaking his head and sighing, he whispered, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stand you, a man. Even if you have heavy feelings, you don&rsquo;t have to be so miserable &quot;</p>
<p>The person who has lost consciousness will not speak without answering.</p>
<p>However, after the initial surprise, people in the right path scolded one after another. Xiaobai looked up, her eyes were bright and beautiful, and immediately smothered them.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi slowly fell down, the bloody handprint on her lapel seemed to be carved. In her white dress, it is particularly striking. People can almost imagine how close the devil&rsquo;s hand was to death to this woman!</p>
<p>However, she even escaped a robbery, the damage is still that demon cult demon.</p>
<p>The outstanding young generation of Qingyun gate is really outstanding.</p>
<p>Xiaobai&rsquo;s eyes swept over all the people, and finally fell on Lu Xueqi. He looked at Lu Xueqi carefully for a moment, nodded, and said with a smile, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s really a beautiful woman.&rdquo;. No wonder men can be crazy about you. After that, she first took a look at the ghost in her arms, and then, intentionally or unintentionally, turned her head and stood aside. Li Xun, whose face is full of pain.</p>
<p>A flash of anger flashed on Li Xun&rsquo;s face. His right hand was beaten back by the force of blood eating demon in the fight just now. Half of his hands were as scorched as before. I don&rsquo;t know whether it will affect his practice in the future. This time, hearing the sudden appearance of the seductive woman, suddenly satirized and said in a rage, &ldquo;who are you. This ghost is a monster of the evil cult. You know how to &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! &quot;</p>
<p>Xiaobai suddenly burst out laughing. Facing all the people in the right path, he deliberately held the unconscious ghost tighter. He immediately made the people around him look sideways. At the same time, he was disdainful. He said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you know what? I&rsquo;ve never known you! &quot;</p>
<p>Li Xun was one of them. For a moment, he didn&rsquo;t know what to say. At the same time, the pain on his right hand became more and more severe, and his heart was even more anxious.</p>
<p>At this time, suddenly a surprised exclamation came from behind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nine tail fox! She is the nine tail fox! &quot;</p>
<p>Everyone was surprised. Lu Xueqi and FA Xiang didn&rsquo;t know the secret of the xuanhuotan in the burning incense Valley, but they just paid it back. However, the disciples in the burning incense valley were in chaos. It was Lu Shun who was the oldest generation on the field.</p>
<p>Xiaobai took a few glances at Lv Shun, thought a little, nodded his head and said, &ldquo;you old man, is that cowardly guy hiding behind the two old thieves, Yun Yilan and shangguance? &quot;</p>
<p>Lu shundeng&rsquo;s face was flushed with anger, and his finger pointed to Xiaobai. He was trembling with anger. In the eyes that peered around him, he said angrily, &ldquo;what are you looking at? I&rsquo;ve caught this demon! &quot;</p>
<p>Xiaobai chuckles and makes a fierce gesture. Lv Shun flies first and intercepts him. Unexpectedly, Xiaobai snorts. The white shadow floats. A faint light flies out of her sleeve and hits Lv Shun&rsquo;s sword.</p>
<p>In the middle of the air, Lu Shunren snorted and turned back. It seemed that he had suffered a little dark loss.</p>
<p>Although Lv Shun&rsquo;s reputation is far less than that of his contemporaries, Yun Yilan and shangguance, Lu Shun is also a character of the older generation of the burning incense valley. However, under the nine tail heavenly foxes, he was blocked back in one round. It is conceivable that the evil spirit is so high.</p>
<p>At that time, everyone yelled and jumped on them. Xiaobai frowned slightly, disdained on his face, and his body swayed by several people. He was about to fly up. Suddenly, there was a pure Buddhist name behind him, and a golden light came.</p>
<p>Xiaobai frowned, his face was surprised for the first time. He turned back and danced with his sleeve robe. A light green light flew out to resist the golden light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great Brahma Prajna,&rdquo; she nodded and said, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe that there are talents like you in Tianyin temple. It&rsquo;s really worthy of being a righteous school comparable to Qingyun. &quot;</p>
<p>Dharma has ten ways: &ldquo;thank you for your praise. Although he spoke politely, the golden light became more and more prosperous after he closed ten. From his sleeve and robe, a golden bead flew out of his sleeve and robe, which was running around and rushing towards Xiaobai.</p>
<p>Xiaobai hummed, and the green light was closed. His whole body floated up and went straight up to the sky. A moment later, the place where he stood just now was hit by the samsara beads. With a roar, the whole ground was made a big pit with a radius of two Zhangs.</p>
<p>No more entanglement. Xiaobai takes advantage of this opportunity to turn around and want to go. Unexpectedly, his body is moving, but he can only see the blue light shining. The &ldquo;hissing&rdquo; sharp sound fills the world in an instant. It is Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s Tianya sword that has arrived. With a cold complexion, Xiaobai suddenly reached out his hand and inserted it directly into the thousands of swords. He only heard the clear echo of &ldquo;Zheng&rdquo;. Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s sword light disappears. She looks surprised. Tianya returns to her hand.</p>
<p>Xiaobai did not hesitate. He was holding the ghost and suddenly disappeared from the sky like a ghost. After a while, some people saw the white shadow like electricity, and they were plunging towards the other side of the river and shouting.</p>
<p>I saw Xiaobai flash into a wooden house. A moment later. Before the crowd arrived, they flew out of the window of the room again. In addition to being fierce, there was a little gray shadow on his shoulder. It was the monkey who was still sleeping</p>
<p>When the crowd arrived, Xiaobai&rsquo;s figure had disappeared. Many people in the right path were angry and scolded, but most of them were shocked. The cultivation of the Nine Tailed Tianhu was so profound that we should not underestimate it.</p>
<p>At this moment, the war in qilidong. Finally, it completely calmed down. What remained was only a burning sea of fire and the painful cry of countless Miao people.</p>
<p>Far away. The wounded tumagu clan leader is shouting, leading a group of people to run up the mountain, obviously to check the condition of the great wizard. On the mountainside, someone had already surrounded the great wizard, and the cry came from far away.</p>
<p>When they returned to their original place, they saw the hot flame around them. The fire devoured the wood&rsquo;s hair, and the crackling sound came out one after another. More and more burned beams and big trees fell down, which was extremely tragic.</p>
<p>FA Xiang shook his head and sighed. His face was full of compassion. He flew into the sea of fire to help the Miao people put out the fire. Influenced by him, other disciples of burning incense Valley followed suit.</p>
<p>At the moment, Li Xun felt that the pain on his right hand had subsided a little. It seemed that as long as he used his power to resist it, there would be no great harm. Then he felt a little relieved and relieved.</p>
<p>Just as he was hesitating whether to join in the fire fighting, a voice came from behind him: &ldquo;senior brother Li. &quot;</p>
<p>Li Xun was stunned. Looking back, Lu Xueqi saw Tianya return to his scabbard and hold it in his hand. His white clothes fluttered in the light of the fire. The bloody handprint on her lapel was so dazzling that she did not seem to conceal it.</p>
<p>At the moment, she looks as indifferent as ever and looks at Li Xun lightly.</p>
<p>Li Xun was not comfortable with her. She said, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter, sister Lu?&rdquo;? &quot;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi looked at Li Xun in silence. After a long time, she said slowly, &ldquo;the wound on your right shoulder is fierce, but you hurt it with a jade ruler? &quot;</p>
<p>Li Xun&rsquo;s mouth suddenly dried up. After a moment, he said frankly, &ldquo;yes. &quot;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi holds Tianya&rsquo;s hand and tightens for a moment. On her white skin, she seems to have light blue.</p>
<p>But her face, still as white as snow and cold, no expression.</p>
<p>She nodded slightly and turned away.</p>
<p>Li Xun&rsquo;s heart suddenly filled with inexplicable anger and said in a loud voice, &ldquo;sister Lu, what do you mean? &quot;</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s body pauses for a while, and her white figure seems to burn under the burning flames around her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good ruler! Awesome! &quot;</p>
<p>Light voice, from the person who did not turn back and carry the body, came over, word by word, very slow, very clear.</p>
<p>Li Xun suddenly lost his voice.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi walked forward. Suddenly, a big house above her had been burning for a long time. With a big bang, a huge beam with a blazing flame hit her head.</p>
<p>Li Xun was surprised, but before he could speak out, Lu Xueqi let out a soft whistle. Somehow, she felt sad and angry. With a wave of her left hand, Tianya sword was swung on the scabbard, and the blue light surged up. In the roar, the giant wood was smashed to pieces, and countless sparks rose to block the sky and block the sun. After a while, it fell like rain, which blocked her and Li Xun, drowning her figure.</p>
<p>Li Xun was stunned by the fire and rain.</p>
<p>The night was deep.</p>
<p>Xiaobai incarnates in the rapid white light, shuttling between the mountains, far away from qilidong. It was about half an hour before she found a quiet place on the mountainside of a high mountain and stopped.</p>
<p>She gently put down the ghost and put him on the ground. She saw that the man was covered with blood, and many of them flowed to his hand. He was slowly sucked in by the blood sucking beads flashing with a strange red light. At the moment, it seems that the blood sucking bead seems to be the spirit attached to the ghost and the spirit of the master is constantly being eroded.</p>
<p>Xiaobai sighs and reaches out to take the demon wand from Gui Li&rsquo;s hand. Unexpectedly, GUI Li is in a coma. But he still held the magic wand tightly in his hand, as if only this thing was his only dependence.</p>
<p>Xiaobai pulled twice, but he couldn&rsquo;t take it from his hand. He shook his head and gave up. But her eyes immediately fell on her hand, her right hand middle finger index finger, originally white jade general finger, now slowly changed into red. There was a little involuntary shaking.</p>
<p>Xiaobai laughed and said in a low voice, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a good Tianya. It really deserves its reputation. It&rsquo;s really a magic weapon &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plop.</p>
<p>A voice suddenly came from her side. Xiaobai was startled. In the twinkling of an eye, it was the drunken ash that fell off her shoulder and fell right next to the seriously injured master. She made two noises in her mouth. He grabbed his head and fell asleep again.</p>
<p>Xiaobai was angry and funny, and said in a loud voice, &ldquo;dead monkey! &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hoo Hoo &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your stupid master is dying! &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hoo Hoo &quot;</p>
<p>「…… &ldquo;Without a word, Xiaobai rolled his eyes at the monkey, kicked the monkey away with one foot, and then squatted down beside the ghost, looked at his injury up and down, and shook his head and sighed.</p>
<p>The night is as cool as water, and the chill is getting deeper and deeper.</p>
<p>That cold, as if experienced many years ago?</p>
<p>When I wake up. The thought passed through my mind.</p>
<p>First of all, open your eyes.</p>
<p>Night sky in southern Xinjiang, at this moment. No more flame, no noise, and finally revealed its original peaceful and peaceful side. Above the curtain of heaven, countless stars adorn it, shining. Or big or small, vaguely like human eyes. Xu is a bit naughty, looking at the world like this playfully.</p>
<p>Severe pain, burst from the right shoulder, and then the whole body, a pain. Even if he is as strong as he is, he can&rsquo;t help but take a breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wake up. &ldquo;A voice of concern was heard beside him.</p>
<p>GUI Li turned his head and saw Xiao Bai&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>He sat up with a brace, but his movements affected the wound and he could not help frowning. Xiaobai took a look at him and said, &ldquo;you are hurt badly. You&rsquo;d better have a good rest first.&rdquo;! &quot;</p>
<p>GUI Li bowed his head and saw that the wound on his right shoulder was wrapped up with white cloth, and other small wounds could be seen to have been treated. There is no one else here. Naturally, it is Xiaobai&rsquo;s credit when he is in a coma.</p>
<p>He whispered, &ldquo;you saved me. Thank you. &quot;</p>
<p>Xiaobai shrugged his shoulders and said, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t do anything. The main thing is that your life is hard. Even I didn&rsquo;t think you could survive in that situation. &quot;</p>
<p>He snorted and recalled the scene of the decisive battle in qilidong. Suddenly, he was so frustrated that he stayed in the same place and didn&rsquo;t want to say anything.</p>
<p>Xiaobai leisurely said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s still the Miao people in qilidong who have the worst luck! Their homes were burned by fire, not to mention the countless deaths and injuries of the clansmen. Even the great wizard they revered, I think it is more or less ominous &quot;</p>
<p>The body suddenly shook.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with him? His voice suddenly became hoarse.</p>
<p>Xiaobai still looked as if he had nothing to do with himself. He said leisurely, &ldquo;I remember that old man fought with a strange man in the sky. Finally, he was exhausted and was seriously injured. Moreover, even their sacred utensils &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is he? Is he dead? &ldquo;He got up and interrupted Xiaobai&rsquo;s words, and obviously he didn&rsquo;t care about the so-called Miao sacred utensils. Just as soon as he stood up, suddenly the pain on the ground appeared. When his feet were soft, the whole person shook and almost fell down.</p>
<p>Xiaobai was just about to reach out to help him, but he was already gasping and barely standing on his body, but on his forehead, he already saw cold sweat.</p>
<p>Xiaobai slowly took back his hand, looked at him silently, and said, &ldquo;Why are you suffering? &quot;</p>
<p>He gasped: &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter with the wizard? Is he OK? &quot;</p>
<p>Xiaobai said, &ldquo;when I took you away, I saw Miao people around the old man from a distance. To be honest, I don&rsquo;t know. &quot;</p>
<p>A look of remorse flashed in his eyes. He gritted his teeth and turned around and left. But he did not take a few steps. Suddenly, he snorted. The white cloth band on the right shoulder wound was already red, and his face began to twist.</p>
<p>Xiaobai was behind him and said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;d better have a rest! The magic sword of Qingyun gate is really a knack to resist thunder. It&rsquo;s not easy to accept it. &quot;</p>
<p>GUI li felt that his internal channels were disordered and his breath was disordered. His own practice of Qingyun sect, the &ldquo;great Brahma Prajna&rdquo; and the secret law of Tianshu were all in a mess. Since he betrayed Qingyun ten years ago, he has fought countless battles in the demon sect, but he is the most wounded today.</p>
<p>Lu Xueqi&rsquo;s practice is really a long journey!</p>
<p>He said this bitterly in his heart, but still forced to resist the pain of his body, he slowly took a step forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want to see that wizard regardless of life or death, for the sake of Biyao? &ldquo;Xiao Bai&rsquo;s voice came from behind him.</p>
<p>GUI Li did not answer, but slowly walked out of the second step.</p>
<p>Xiaobai looked at the stubborn figure behind him, gave a long breath, shook his head and said with a bitter smile, &ldquo;you are powerful, you are powerful! &ldquo;He said, and slowly followed.</p>
<p>Just a moment later, she suddenly said, &ldquo;which one do you like better than the girl in white tonight? &quot;</p>
<p>Guili body a shock, Huoran back, tightly staring at Xiaobai, Xiaobai does not change color, in the Guili even with a trace of fierce eyes, still smiling at him.</p>
<p>GUI Li breathed heavily and turned his head slowly, no longer looking at her. After a while, he slowly, but seemed to be deep in his heart. He said in a low voice, &ldquo;in this world, only Biyao is sincere to me! &quot;</p>
<p>Xiaobai is silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For her, I&rsquo;m dead. What&rsquo;s that? &ldquo;He said slowly, then moved his body forward.</p>
<p>The sky, bright stars, scattered on the world.</p>
<p>Xiaobai youyou sighed, followed up, walked a few steps, and then turned back to the place where he had been resting. He called out, &ldquo;dead monkey, we are going! &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hoo Hoo &quot;</p>
<p>Xiaobai: &quot; (to be continued. )</p>
