      <p>Tian is not easy to stand up, looking at Lin Jingyu in Shangbu, his face is extremely ugly, and he said coldly in his mouth, &ldquo;Good ability! Good murderous!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Qi Hao whispered to Lin Jingyu: &ldquo;Brother, please stay with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu was young and angry, his brows were tight, and he took a step, but said to Zhang Xiaofan who was standing on the side: &ldquo;Xiaofan, I was just wrong. I said I tried my own practice, but I didn’t make a difference. .&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was really worried about his friend, but he said in his mouth: &ldquo;No, nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everyone in Dazhufeng changed his face, and Tian was not even more angry in his heart. He suddenly took a step, and his face flew by with anger.</p>
<p>Qi Hao&rsquo;s face changed greatly. He is different from Lin Jingyu. He has been in the Qingyun Gate for a long time. He knows that although the strength of Dazhufeng&rsquo;s pulse is far less than the other six pulses, the first Tian is not easy to do with his wife Su Ru, but he has amazing magical powers. Dare to despise. The Cangsong Taoist who always looked above the top also told him before his departure: Tian is not easy to be angry, but his practice is very high. In addition, his wife Su Ru is also a famous talent in Qingyun Gate, which is also respected by the real master Xuanzhen. He and his wife scored three points, so don&rsquo;t provoke him before the last resort.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu was totally unaware of this, but looking at him, even if he knew it, he wasn’t worried. At a young age, arrogance is extremely heavy, and most of the time I want to be loved by the Cangsong Taoist.</p>
<p>Tian was not easy to look at him, he was even more annoyed, and he was about to move. Suddenly the figure flashed. Su Ru had stood next to her husband and reached out to hold him. There was a faint smile on his mouth, and he whispered in his mouth: A lot of age, what happened to the juniors, what does it look like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian was not stunned for a moment. He stopped and Qi Hao quickly blocked himself in front of his younger brother, and said with a smile: &ldquo;Uncle Tian Shi has a large number of people, please look at the division of the teacher at home, don&rsquo;t know with our younger people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan saw Lin Jingyu annoyed Master and was anxious in his eyes. In his eyes, Lin Jingyu, also an orphan of Caomiao Village, was like a white brother. Seeing Qi Hao pleading for Lin Jingyu at this time, his heart was hot, and he could not help but ran out and knelt in front of Tian Yiyi. He said, &ldquo;Master, all disciples are bad. Seeing Jing Yu, no, Brother Lin, the sword. Coming here, I wanted to see his spiritual practice, so I started, everything is a disciple&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Nan was depressed in his heart, unable to vent his anger, and forced it down. Qi Hao was okay, but he saw that Xiao Fan was kneeling in front of him too, with a lot of tongues and tongues. It seemed stupid and impatient, and he felt angry in his heart and said angrily: &ldquo;Shut up, useless things!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Speaking of the sleeve robe, Zhang Xiaofan only felt that the wind was blowing, and suddenly his body was light, and the gusts of wind were up and down, and the surrounding air seemed to disappear. He was top-heavy. Immediately, a huge stream of mountains and seas poured in, and the whole body flew backwards involuntarily, rushing straight to the wall on the side of the Shoujingtang. With a loud bang, it hit the wall firmly and fell down. Zhang Xiaofan felt dizzy, his throat was sweet, and he wowed out a bit of blood.</p>
<p>In Shoujingtang, everyone was stunned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad!&rdquo; Tian Ling&rsquo;er shouted first, rushed up to support Zhang Xiaofan, Lin Jingyu almost rushed at the same time, seeing Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s chest blood stains, rushing upward, if he was injured, it might not be so annoying, but he Seeing that Zhang Xiaofan pleaded for himself but ended like this, Lin Jingyu no longer ignored it, and turned back to Tian, ​​who was not easy to shout, &ldquo;Shutty, what are you doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the talk, the Dragon Sword seemed to sense the master&rsquo;s mind, and the blue light returned to prosperity.</p>
<p>Tian was not easy to raise his eyebrows, fearing that he would not be angry with this chunky man, and his sleeves waved, and the sound of &ldquo;shoo&rdquo; disappeared in front of everyone.</p>
<p>Qi Haoji shouted: &ldquo;Brother, be careful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu had already taken precautions in her heart. At this moment, when she saw that Tian was not easy to look like ghosts and ghosts, she immediately cut the Dragon Sword Sacrifice in front of her and protected her whole body with a sword-like blue light.</p>
<p>It was just a flower in front of him, that Tian Tian was not stupid, and his body looked like Dao Ling, and Qingguang was like nothing. Huo Ran appeared in front of him. All the swordsmanship of Qingguang was three feet away from his body. Lin Jingyu&rsquo;s heart jumped, and Tian was not easy to get angry, almost clinging to his face, and panicked in his heart, &ldquo;pedaling&rdquo; backwards, Rao is so, the dragon sword is not messy, volley Protect the Lord in front of you.</p>
<p>Tian is not easy to sneer, his right hand is stretched out, and he is suddenly inserted into the sword gas, a layer of red awns is raised on the palm, resisting the blue light, and in the blink of an eye, he actually grabbed the dragon sword.</p>
<p>Qi Hao immediately grabbed the court and shouted, &ldquo;Uncle Tian, ​​be merciful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian is not easy but does not chase, let Qi Hao guard Lin Jingyu behind him, only looking at the dragon sword in his hand.</p>
<p>At this time, almost all the blue light of Jian Qi had dissipated, but the Dragon Sword seemed to be spiritual, and the sword in the Tian Tianfa fat hand flickered, struggling, and half of his body was green, but he still could not break free.</p>
<p>Tian was not easy to raise his eyes and looked forward, and said coldly: &ldquo;The Dragon Sword is certainly a nine-day god soldier, but it is not necessarily invincible!&rdquo; As soon as the words fell, his five fingers suddenly exerted force, and if the Dragon Sword was severely hit, he immediately obediently refused. After a few moments of play, the whole sword suddenly regained its blue sword spirit, and it was dazzling. I don’t know how much brighter it was in Lin Jingyu’s hands. Qi Hao lost his voice: &ldquo;Uncle Tian Shi&hellip;&rdquo; Tian is not easy to face. Frost, no more words, squeezing the dragon sword with his right hand, striking the sky from top to bottom in the direction of Qi Hao and Lin Jingyu, the sharp sound of breaking the sky sounded, the sharp scream suddenly, the green mania was violent Like a mountain, it turned out to be a large green gas column of two people.</p>
<p>Qi Hao gritted his teeth and lifted his sword together with both hands. With the sound of &ldquo;Zheng&rdquo;, a white fairy sword was quickly sacrificed. It was his &ldquo;ice&rdquo; that had long held the name of rose.</p>
<p>When it was time and time, it was only a blink of an eye, and Tian Green&rsquo;s green man&rsquo;s sword gas burst out of the air. Qi Hao guarded Lin Jingyu several steps back and forth, and his right-hand sword tactics continued to lead. The &ldquo;Hengbing Sword&rdquo; white light flashed rapidly, and the chill was strong. For a moment, seven ice walls were connected in front of him.</p>
<p>Just listening to the &ldquo;bang, bang&rdquo; sounded continuously, the green man&rsquo;s sword gas has already hit the ice wall, but it is very different from the previous Lin Jingyu Yujian hit the ice wall. This time the dragon sword is actually like a bamboo, the sound is ice breaking, for a moment. The seven ice walls were smashed, the ice was splashing, and the green man&rsquo;s sword gas was not reduced by half, the momentum was stronger, such as the angry dragon roaring, and the teeth rushed towards Qi Hao.</p>
<p>Qi Hao&rsquo;s face was pale, avoiding inevitable, and had to do his utmost to move his fingers together. The ice sword gave off ten thousand white lights and condensed into a shield to block in front of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boom&rdquo;, with a loud noise, the green man&rsquo;s sword slammed against the white light. Although he did not smash it immediately, he immediately pressed the white mang back, Qi Hao&rsquo;s eyes widened, and he tried all his energy, finally finally forced it. It seemed that the unstoppable green man&rsquo;s sword gas was blocked in front of him. At this moment, he just felt that the green gleam in front of him was dazzling, the wind was screaming, and was close at hand, as if facing a fierce beast in the face, it was horrifying.</p>
<p>Before he had settled his mind, the surging pressure of Green Mango was overwhelmed. Qi Hao tried his best to maintain the white light, but his feet could no longer be supported, and he was pushed back by the power of the British University. Go out.</p>
<p>From the beginning to the present, Tian Nanyi has been standing in the same place, and has not moved, but the green mansword spirit inspired by the dragon sword in his hand is farther and stronger. Qi Hao and the two were pushed straight to Shoujingtang by this force. Outside the door, I still couldn&rsquo;t help pushing backwards, especially when I went out of the Shoujingtang to the open space, and the green mansions were even more prosperous. Wherever I passed, the open space was cut by a huge blade, and the depth was one foot deep. The huge ravine is shocking.</p>
<p>Such amazing green mansword gas was continuously shot from the Shoujingtang, pushing Qi Hao and the two back backwards for a full three feet. At this time, the white light in front of Qi Hao had been compressed to less than half a foot from his body, and he himself was short of breath, his face turned from red to green, and his feet fell into the ground somehow. After a moment, Qi Hao finally shouted, unable to support, the white light dared, the ice sword was hit by the great force and lost control.</p>
<p>Qi Hao and Lin Jingyu had no blood on their faces, and they saw the fierce green mansword rushed to their eyes in a blink of an eye. When they were sentenced to death, they suddenly stopped and stopped in midair.</p>
<p>Qi Hao sweated in his palm and did not dare to move.</p>
<p>After a while, the green mang seemed to have lost control and slowly dispersed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zheng&rdquo;!</p>
<p>At the sharp noise, the ice sword fell down again and inserted in front of the two. Qi Hao was frightened, and quickly hurriedly said to Shou Jingtang: &ldquo;Thank you Master Uncle Tian for mercy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu on the side saw that the unsurprising Tian Tian was not so capable, and could not help but bow his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Squeak&rdquo;, the sound of breaking the sky sounded again, the two were frightened, but they saw a flash of green light, and something flew out of the Shoujingtang. The blue light flickered. It was the dragon sword and the volley. He fell unbiasedly in front of the two, inserted on the ground, right next to the ice sword, and the two swords were crossed and trembling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo; Tian Nan&rsquo;s uneasy voice returned to calm, and came from a distance from the hall, the indifferent meaning clearly revealed.</p>
<p>Qi Hao hurriedly responded, and pulled Lin Jingyu, who was still looking at the hall, and the two put away their fairy swords. They dared not stay longer and Yukong went away.</p>
<p>In Shoujingtang, the disciples saw that Tian was not easily moved by thunder, and all of them did not dare to breathe, especially Zhang Xiaofan, who for the first time saw Tian was not easy to use magical powers and admiration. He almost forgot the chest injury and dragged the wound when he lost his mind. At that moment, the pain was so loud, &ldquo;Oops,&rdquo; he cried out, his teeth grinning.</p>
<p>Tian is not easy to hear Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s name pain Lu and looked at him. Zhang Xiaofan gritted his teeth and endured it, bowing his head. Tian didn&rsquo;t easily look at him, but he didn&rsquo;t say anything, and he looked at the disciples who lined up side by side.</p>
<p>Everyone lowered their heads and dared not look at him.</p>
<p>Tian Duan sighed deeply, shook his head slightly, carried his hands on his back, and walked to the back hall. Su Ru, who was standing aside, looked at her husband&rsquo;s back and said to everyone, &ldquo;Go ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The disciples responded, and Tian Lingji stepped up to support Zhang Xiaofan. Go out with everyone. When everyone walked out of the Shoujing Church, Su Ru walked into the back hall alone. After passing through the door, he saw that Tian was not standing on the corridor and stared at the green bamboo in the courtyard.</p>
<p>Su Ru walked over. Came to her husband and said softly: &ldquo;How come there is such a big fire today?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian is not easy to shake his head slightly. Do not answer the question: &ldquo;When Shicailing Linger and Lin Jingyu started, Qi Hao condensed ice into a wall to block the dragon sword, can you see clearly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru sighed. Tao: &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t sacrifice the ice sword.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Hao snorted and said: &ldquo;In the last seven-pulse trial, Qi Haoshang had to rely on the power of the magic sword and magic weapon to condense the ice wall. It was only a few decades later that he had already repaired this state.&rdquo; , He turned to look at Su Ru. Said, &ldquo;You watched it just now. What did you think of his practice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru said lightly: &ldquo;He was calm and spared when casting spells. At least he had reached the eighth floor of Yuqingjing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian was not easy to move his mouth, and he continued to speak, but Su Ru said for him: &ldquo;Under the gate of Dazhufeng, no one is his opponent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Zhuan took a deep look at his wife, slowly turned his head, and looked at the green bamboo in the garden. As the winter approached, they gradually withered and turned yellow. Unconsciously startled.</p>
<p>After a while. He suddenly said: &ldquo;How is the seventh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru looked at him, a smile appeared on the corner of his mouth, and said, &ldquo;What else can you do, he was spitting blood on you as a big fairy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian didn&rsquo;t seem to suffocate, and the chunky body moved. But he didn&rsquo;t look back, said lightly, &ldquo;Tonight you take a big yellow pill and go to see him, lest he pretend to be dead tomorrow and we will have no food.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru smiled and said nothing.</p>
<p>At night, it became dark.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan slowly walked back to the house and pushed open the door. He followed the monkey Xiaohui who was behind him and rushed into the room for the first time. Then, only a day later, Dahuang, who was intimate with Xiaohui, also followed. One monkey and one dog clamored in the room, and the sounds of &ldquo;Wang Wang Wang&rdquo; and &ldquo;Squeak&rdquo; came one after another.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan smiled a little at the corner of his mouth, walked to the table and sat down. His chest was still hurting faintly, but his head was full of all kinds of magic tricks when Tian Yi and others were fighting, and he couldn&rsquo;t help but sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How sighed well?&rdquo; A soft and peaceful voice rang from the door.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was taken aback and looked back, but it was Su Ru who stood at the door. Nocturnal practice, blowing her clothes to dance lightly, slightly moving hair, looks like a fairy. He quickly stood up and said, &ldquo;Madam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru walked up to him, put his hand on his shoulder, and smiled, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright, sit down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was flattered and didn&rsquo;t dare to violate his orders. He sat down, Su Ru looked at his face carefully, then reached out to his chest to probe, nodded, and said, &ldquo;Fortunately, it&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo; Take a small white bottle from her arms, pour a yellow pill with the size of a finger from the middle, and hand it to Zhang Xiaofan, saying: &ldquo;Take it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan hesitated and swallowed it. After a while, he felt a warmth first emerged from Dantian, and then spread to the top of his limbs. The whole body was very warm and comfortable. Even the faint pain in his chest disappeared.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was shocked and delighted, stood up and moved around, and as expected, everything worked as usual, and the elixir worked wonders. With joy in his heart, he quickly said to Su Ru: &ldquo;Thank you, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru nodded with a smile. Put away the vial and sit down in another chair, saying, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to thank me, your master told me to take Da Huang Dan for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was startled and said, &ldquo;Master, doesn&rsquo;t he blame me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru glanced at him and smiled, &ldquo;He asked me to come to see you. Naturally, I don&rsquo;t blame you. But I don&rsquo;t know if you blame him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was startled, and quickly said: &ldquo;Nothing, madam, I will not dare&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru raised her hand and stopped Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s words and said softly, &ldquo;Xiaofan, can you listen to me, please?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan suddenly jumped in his heart for no reason, whispering, &ldquo;Yes. Madam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Rudao said: &ldquo;During the day your master started to beat you, it was indeed his fault. I saw clearly on the side, and he regretted it when he started. Only his temper&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a light pity on her face, and then she said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just that he is always strong, and he has a very heavy face, so even if I have regrets in my heart, I won&rsquo;t say it. Resent him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan shook his head and said, &ldquo;Sister, I don&rsquo;t dare to blame Master. I only blame myself for being too stupid, which makes Master angry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru glanced at him and sighed, &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t really matter to you. Cultivation and cultivation of Taoism, it depends on the qualifications of each person. Although it is said that diligence can make up for it, it is worse. After all, your Master is in his heart. Understood, it’s not this that bothers him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was surprised: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the trouble with Master?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru smiled faintly, and there was a trace of helplessness between the eyebrows and said: &ldquo;Talents like Qi Hao and Lin Jingyu have always been encountered but not sought, but now in the Qingyun Gate, Dazhufeng&rsquo;s veins are gradually fading. Your master practice Although he is tall, he is often ridiculed by his uncles because of his disciples. He has a strong temperament and is very uncomfortable in his heart, and he is worried that after he has gone to emperor immortality, Dazhufeng is only afraid of never turning over, which is even more sorry. Patriarch has been listed. This heavy burden is placed on his shoulders, and he is actually very bitter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was speechless, Su Ru immediately woke up, shook his head and smiled bitterly: &ldquo;Really, I said to you a 14-year-old little hairy boy what to do?&rdquo; He stood up, patted his shoulder, said: &ldquo;early Take a rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan responded and said, &ldquo;Yes, madam, you walk slowly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru nodded and went out. Zhang Xiaofan had been delivered to the door, watching Su Ru&rsquo;s back disappear, and then returned to the room.</p>
<p>It was just that he had just entered the room door, and suddenly his eyes lit up. I saw a table in the house, the lights were swaying, and there was a woman in red, with a face like a hibiscus, and a peach and plum, not a thing.</p>
<p>He stared blankly, his heartbeat suddenly accelerated, and his mouth screamed, &ldquo;Sister!&rdquo;</p>
