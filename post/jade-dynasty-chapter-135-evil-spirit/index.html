      <p>Two hundred Li to the north of &ldquo;Xianyong mountain&rdquo; in central Turkey is the tall &ldquo;Huqi mountain&rdquo;. Looking up from the foot of the mountain, you can see that the rock falls through the sky, which is abrupt and precipitous. However, there was no vegetation on the whole mountain, which was extremely desolate. On the left side of the mountain range, a river, called Shengshui, emerges from an underground spring in the middle of the mountain. It flows to the northeast. Along the way, there are more and more tributaries, and the river grows bigger and bigger. Three hundred miles away, it flows into another big river, Fenshui. It has been said since ancient times that there is a kind of Dark Jade in this river, but no one has ever seen it.</p>
<p>The general Hall of the &ldquo;ghost King sect&rdquo;, one of the three major sects of the demon sect, is built in the hard and thick rock belly of this mountain, which has always been little known. Under the Guili&rsquo;s leadership, Xiaobai and the great wizard finally arrived here after a 15 day trek.</p>
<p>Because the big wizard was too weak, he had to go down. The three people and monkey ash had to walk. On the way, GUI Li once hired a car to let the wizard ride.</p>
<p>The long-distance hardships made all three of them look sleepy and dusty, but they were completely different in the great wizard and GUI Li.</p>
<p>The fierce injury is getting better day by day. Maybe it&rsquo;s a young man!</p>
<p>On the other hand, the great wizard&rsquo;s looks are more and more ugly than he was when he left qilidong in southern Xinjiang 15 days ago. His face looks like ashes. Since he entered the mountain road, there is no coach to ride. Although he has the help of ghost and Xiaobai, he still takes a few steps to catch his breath. His physical strength is very poor. GUI Li was very anxious in his heart, and sometimes he could not help but be afraid: if he had not arrived at Huqi mountain, the great wizard who saved his life should die in case he died on the way.</p>
<p>Fortunately, this afternoon, under the warm sunshine, the three finally saw the bare top of Huqi mountain.</p>
<p>He stopped. Although he had not reached Huqi mountain, he was still relieved. He turned to the wizard and said, &ldquo;master, the barren mountain ahead is where we are going. Go a little further from here. We should be at the foot of the mountain later tonight</p>
<p>The great wizard let out a long breath, raised his eyes and looked at the mountain range, and laughed wearily. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry! Young man, I will not die until I see your sleeping friend</p>
<p>He was stunned, then he apologized and said in a low voice, &ldquo;master.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t mean to&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>The old eyes of the great wizard drew back, reached out and patted him on the shoulder, and shook his head with a smile: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean anything else. I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m a bit more anxious than you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master, we&rsquo;ve been walking for a long time. We&rsquo;ll have a rest here for a while, and we&rsquo;ll have to go on our way later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The great wizard seems really tired. He nodded, and with the help of the ghost, he found a flat stone by the mountain path and sat down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Squeak!&rdquo; Has been lying on the shoulders of the small ash called twice, jumped down, fell on the ground. Along the way, it is small ash is the most energetic, never tired color.</p>
<p>At the moment, the monkey looked around and saw the sparse woods on both sides of the road, and called twice. He ran in and disappeared in a twinkling of an eye.</p>
<p>Ghost Li to the direction of small ash to look at, also do not care, looking back to plan to find a stone to sit down and rest. All the way to today. Although he was seriously injured in qilidong, his muscles and bones were not injured, and he was getting better and better. However, there was still a faint pain in the wound on his right shoulder. He stroked the wound on his right shoulder with his hand. Li Xun&rsquo;s figure of burning incense Valley flashed before his eyes, and he snorted coldly in his heart.</p>
<p>Just a moment later. Behind Li Xun, there is another graceful figure, white as snow</p>
<p>Ghost Li shook his head, a moment of frustration, is thinking, suddenly listen to Xiaobai&rsquo;s voice suddenly rang in the side: &ldquo;Huqi mountain how so desolate, I have been watching for a long time, not even a plant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>GUI Li frowned and said, &ldquo;since I arrived here, it has been so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaobai stood beside him, silent for a moment, shook his head and said, &ldquo;when I left here, Huqi mountain was full of green and lush vegetation, which was definitely different from the present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ghost Li shook his head and said, &ldquo;then I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Besides, Xiaobai didn&rsquo;t turn around.</p>
<p>Ghost Li looked at Xiaobai, and knew that she had been recuperating here with the fox demon clan thousands of years ago. She had a different feeling for Hu Qishan, but she didn&rsquo;t know what to say. Moreover, he didn&rsquo;t want to talk more because of his mood at the moment.</p>
<p>As long as you think of Biyao in that mountain range, and maybe tomorrow this time, she may be able to rebirth. With this in mind, GUI Li couldn&rsquo;t help but feel his blood boiling, and he couldn&rsquo;t think of anything else.</p>
<p>The three took a rest for a while. When the great wizard regained his strength, he led the two to go on. In fact, he was only the big wizard.</p>
<p>Xiaobai was walking alone in front of her. Her face was quiet and silent, but she seemed to get familiar with the road around her. When she met some ghost questions, she just started to follow.</p>
<p>Later, it seems that the memory of the past has begun to wake up in Xiaobai&rsquo;s heart. Naturally, she turns into a leading figure and walks along the mountain road leading to Huqi mountain.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know when the monkey came back from the woods, and a few more wild fruits from unknown places were in his hands and gnawed.</p>
<p>Behind Xiaohui, there is also a big wine bag, which was stolen from Miao people in southern Xinjiang. At first, there were two wine bags, but they drank intermittently all the way. The monkey&rsquo;s drinking capacity was also growing. On the 15th day, he drank a large bag of liquor and never got drunk again.</p>
<p>On the way, Xiaobai saw that the monkey was always dragging the wine bag to and fro, which was really troublesome, so he sewed a belt on the wine bag with cloth belt, so that the small ash was carried on his body. This is good, Xiaohui is more happy, all day carrying wine bags around.</p>
<p>Three people and a monkey, in this way, in the sound of monkeys eating wild fruit, each with heart in mind to move forward silently.</p>
<p>As the sun began to slant westward, it was getting dark. Just before dusk arrived, they finally reached the foot of Huqi mountain.</p>
<p>Almost at the same time, the big wizard and Xiao Bai&rsquo;s bodies were shocked. The wizard seemed to feel something. He took a look at Xiaobai standing beside him and whispered, &ldquo;do you also feel it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaobai&rsquo;s eyebrows wrinkled slightly. With her thousand year old spirit Fox&rsquo;s way, this spiritual power and feeling are not trivial, extremely keen. Almost when she arrived at the foot of Huqi mountain, she suddenly felt the mountain, under the seemingly ordinary desolation. A strong evil spirit was revealed.</p>
<p>This evil spirit is so strong that even her high morality can&rsquo;t help being afraid of it. But after carefully feeling, she even with her own sharp spiritual power, aware that there are two more spiritual power of depression. Although unwilling, but also can only accept life in general, surrender in the evil spirit.</p>
<p>There is a big secret in this mountain!</p>
<p>Slowly put away the surprised color on the face, blink of an eye to restore the usual expression of small white to the big wizard. But I didn&rsquo;t expect that this seemingly sleepy and dying old man still had such a keen sense. It seems that witchcraft in southern Xinjiang is indeed unique.</p>
<p>She nodded slowly, lowered her voice and said, &ldquo;what a heavy evil spirit!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The great wizard was silent for a moment and nodded. At the same time, they both looked at the ghost, but they only saw the ghost&rsquo;s face, and there was a strange look.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s between his sleeves. The blood sucking beads on the black soul swallowing suddenly lit up, and the blood red light flowed ceaselessly, even the sleeve robe could not block it.</p>
<p>GUI Li slowly took out the Soul Eater and held it up to his body. At the front end of the magic wand, the light of the blood sucking beads appeared in a strange way. The bright red light was slowly emitted in circles. The blood vessels on the beads became clear one by one. And along his wrist. The blood sucking bead is a cold and exciting breath that goes all over his body.</p>
<p>He looked up at the mountain in front of him with a strange light in his eyes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a sign that the blood sucking beads are dying for blood!</p>
<p>To him, this is already familiar.</p>
<p>The ghost king himself stood at the entrance of the hall. It is not difficult to imagine how much he attached importance to the great wizard who was brought back by the ghost.</p>
<p>After the three of them appeared in front of them, the ghost king and GUI Li nodded at random, which was a greeting, and then walked quickly to the big wizard. Looking at the wizard, he said, &ldquo;master, your body&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a faint smile, the great wizard said, &ldquo;this is the fate of the dying old man. Today, I just want to do my best. It depends on the will of God. &quot;</p>
<p>As soon as the ghost king bowed to the ground, he made a deep salute and said in a deep voice, &ldquo;master is an expert in the world. I don&rsquo;t want to talk about the common saying any more. It&rsquo;s a hard journey, and it&rsquo;s late tonight. Please go to this cave in the mountains for a short time. I&rsquo;ll have a rest and ask the master tomorrow. &quot;</p>
<p>The great wizard nodded and looked at him. He was really tired.</p>
<p>The ghost King waved his hand, and someone nearby had already run over and helped the great wizard in. A group of people all made way for the road. After a moment, the figure of the wizard disappeared in the middle of the mountain.</p>
<p>The ghost King slowly turned around. At the moment, the man standing in front of him, in addition to the ghostly, there was a strange charming woman behind him. As for the monkey Xiaohui, he kept his three eyes open and looked at the people in front of him.</p>
<p>The ghost King&rsquo;s eyes stopped for a moment on Xiao Hui&rsquo;s body, and then looked at Xiao Bai behind GUI Li. Finally, he returned to the young man in front of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you hurt?&rdquo; Ghost King slowly tunnel.</p>
<p>He just nodded.</p>
<p>The scene suddenly quieted down. The two men stood face to face in a strange atmosphere. For ten years, the ghost king has taught GUI Li with great care, but there seems to be an invisible deep groove between them.</p>
<p>Behind the ghost king stood Qinglong, Youji and many other disciples.</p>
<p>There were many faces that he recognized, because many of them were he who destroyed the evil cult sect and received these forces under the guiwangzong banner. At the moment, the old man of the blood refining hall and others were standing in the crowd.</p>
<p>Only the wild dog Taoist is not among them. I don&rsquo;t know if he is still wandering around the world with the fortune teller, the immortal master and the sun?</p>
<p>The power of the ghost King clan seems to be growing stronger and stronger.</p>
<p>Mountain wind blowing, I do not know who snatched up the clothes, whirring. Deep inside the mountain, it seems that there is a black shadow, vaguely shaking.</p>
<p>GUI Li withdrew his eyes. Although he could not see clearly, he knew who the man in the dark place was - Mr. ghost!</p>
<p>This mysterious figure seems to hide in the dark forever, hiding behind the ghost king.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this girl your friend? Did you bring it back? &quot; The ghost king asked faintly, and he could not see a trace of strange look on his face.</p>
<p>He hesitated for a moment and said, &ldquo;she said it&rsquo;s your old friend. She wants to come back to see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost king was stunned. The answer was unexpected. He could not help looking at Xiaobai more, but he could not remember when he knew such a woman. &ldquo;This girl, did we ever know each other in the past</p>
<p>Xiaobai took a step, sighed, and then said with a smile: &ldquo;Xiaochi, is she OK? Is it the same as before. From time to time in a daze, looking at a flower will also see silly</p>
<p>The ghost King&rsquo;s body was shocked, and there was a rare look of astonishment on his face. Not only he, but also behind him, followed him for a long time, such as Qinglong and Youji. At the same time, his face changed a lot, and an expression of disbelief appeared on his face.</p>
<p>The ghost King stared at Xiaobai and said for a long time: &ldquo;who are you? How can you know Xiao Little fool? &quot;</p>
<p>Xiaobai&rsquo;s eyes wandered over the crowd and looked up leisurely. In the dusk, the shadow of Huqi mountain was desolate and tall, with a desolate scene.</p>
<p>How much time, between the fingers quietly like sand sliding</p>
<p>&ldquo;You remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The name of this mountain?&rdquo; she said</p>
<p>The ghost King&rsquo;s eyes were bright and his eyes were bright, but he was more surprised and said, &ldquo;you are white&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a white fox!&rdquo; said Xiao Bai</p>
<p>Mountain wind &ldquo;Wu&rdquo; a blow, rolled up the light dust on the ground, toward the distance quietly fly away.</p>
<p>In the secluded stone room, the furnishings are very simple, with tables, chairs, beds and simple furniture. This is the bedroom of the Lord of the ghost King clan.</p>
<p>The only one that&rsquo;s a little conspicuous. This is the red sandalwood desk placed against the stone wall. There are three stacks of books on it. There is a white jade penholder on the table top, and a small writing brush with a wolf hair on it. The ink on the inkstone beside it is not dry. And a little farther away, there is a blue and white brush wash, bright and translucent, containing half a basin of water.</p>
<p>In all these ways, we can not help but give people a refined demeanor. There is absolutely no trace of it. People in the world imagine the appearance of the Lord of the great sect of the Chinese devil sect.</p>
<p>Ghost king and Xiaobai. Standing in the room at the moment, there was no one else but them.</p>
<p>On the other side of the room, on the stone wall, hung a fine painting of gold. In the picture, a beautiful woman is carefully examining a blooming flower with a pair of butterflies flying. It&rsquo;s just that the woman in the painting looks so carefully and attentively that all her spirit is on the flower, and she doesn&rsquo;t notice the appearance of butterflies nearby.</p>
<p>The fine brushwork of this painting is exquisite. The meticulous and slow depiction of fine brushwork style are fully displayed by the painter. The woman in the painting is almost like she has come back to life. Her expression of being infatuated with flowers is even more obvious.</p>
<p>Xiaobai looked at the woman in the painting in silence. After a long time, he sighed and said, &ldquo;your painting skills are really great. You can make Xiaochi&rsquo;s paintings so lifelike that you can see people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Standing behind Xiaobai, the ghost king is also looking at the painting. In his eyes, there is tenderness that has never been shown in front of outsiders. He shook his head in silence, then whispered, &ldquo;I just wish I couldn&rsquo;t save her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiaobai&rsquo;s eyes did not leave the painting, and he said: &ldquo;I have never known that the man who is trying to save is you and Xiaochi&rsquo;s daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost King laughed miserably and said, &ldquo;when Xiaochi went, I couldn&rsquo;t catch up to see her for the last time. Over the years, every time I think about it, I feel like a knife in my heart. Now she has nothing left, only Biyao But she also</p>
<p>Xiaobai said faintly: &ldquo;she didn&rsquo;t read the wrong person. It&rsquo;s her blessing to choose you. I don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;ll regret it before she dies. &quot;</p>
<p>The ghost king was silent.</p>
<p>Xiaobai takes a step and reaches out his gentle finger. His fingertips gently caress the delicate and beautiful face of the woman in the painting. His eyes gradually show a light crystal light, with a bit of sadness and love.</p>
<p>Monkey small ash &ldquo;squeak&rdquo; a strange cry, jumped to the bed above. Back to the haunted bedroom of huqishan, which has not been seen for a long time, it seems that it has no strange feeling at all. It jumps on it for several times, and suddenly remembers something. It reaches out and moves the wine bag from behind, pulls out the stopper and drinks a big gulp of liquor.</p>
<p>After a while, the monkey &ldquo;Hoo&rdquo; a long breath, squint eyes, a face of happiness and satisfaction.</p>
<p>GUI Li stood in front of the bed and looked at the monkey&rsquo;s expression. He was silent. He slowly shook his head and sighed. He turned and walked to the door. He opened the door and went out. Then he closed the door with his backhand.</p>
<p>The corridor is deep and extends forward. He walked slowly in the tunnel in the middle of the mountain. All the way, people who saw him bowed their heads. But his face was indifferent, his eyes were only looking ahead, as if there was a place calling for him.</p>
<p>After passing the corner and the passage, the shadow of the ghost King sect&rsquo;s disciples gradually disappeared. When he came to the familiar icestone chamber, he saw only a silent figure like a ghost.</p>
<p>The black veil on Youji&rsquo;s face moved, turned around and looked at the ghost.</p>
<p>Fierce eyes swept from her black veil and fell on the stone door behind her. The next moment, he did not have the slightest hesitation to go over, opened the stone door and went in.</p>
<p>The stone gate closed slowly behind him. You Ji&rsquo;s figure was still, standing alone at the door.</p>
<p>In the stone chamber, on the cold stone platform, in the rising silk white gas and light smoke, the beautiful woman is lying there peacefully, and the corner of her mouth seems to have a faint smile.</p>
<p>Ghost Li back against the stone gate, suddenly, his indifference and strong, like a sudden relaxation down in general, a little loose, a little bit of peeling. The rest, only a Xiao Suo figure, slowly walked up and sat down beside her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m back, Biyao&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The light smoke curls up from the cold stone platform, which makes the body of Biyao seem to have some unreal feeling. Her face is so beautiful, her smile is so warm, isn&rsquo;t she also know the man&rsquo;s return?</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are saved, Biyao.&rdquo; His voice, deep and slightly trembling, &ldquo;ten years, ten years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I let you lie like this for ten years. I&rsquo;m useless. You must blame me No, it won&rsquo;t. how can you blame me! You&rsquo;re just smiling at me, aren&rsquo;t you? &quot;</p>
<p>There was no answer, only wisps of light smoke, slowly converged and separated in front of his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will save you, Biyao. You will wake up.&rdquo; He said in a low voice, &ldquo;we will be together, Biyao. We will be together all our lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the light smoke, the deep words scattered, floating in the stone chamber, and then gently dispersed, leaving no trace.</p>
<p>Note 1: &ldquo;shanhaijingshanjingbeishanjing&rdquo; Huqi mountain: Yongshan County, another 200 miles north, said Huqi mountain, no vegetation, more green. Shengshui comes from Yan, and the Northeast flows with Fenshui, among which cangyu is more. (to be continued. )</p>
