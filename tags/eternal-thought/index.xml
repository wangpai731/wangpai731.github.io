      <description>In the second area, the ghost tooth retracts the two fingers that he has stretched out to deal with others. He only needs one finger, but Gongsun Yun in front of him can resist his first finger.
At the moment, Gongsun Yun looks pale, quickly retreats, and bitterly admits defeat. Resistance to the first finger is the limit. He can&amp;rsquo;t be hurt too much. Even if he can&amp;rsquo;t fight for the first, he has to fight for the second.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Too Too strong
&amp;ldquo;This ghost tooth, I&amp;rsquo;m afraid even the inner disciples can crush it directly. It&amp;rsquo;s really the first person to build the foundation!&amp;rdquo;

Only with the mysterious and unpredictable mind can we have this kind of terrifying power!&amp;rdquo; After a brief silence, low voices came out from the south bank and the north bank.</description>

      <description>With the departure of beihanlie&amp;rsquo;s master and apprentice, all the disciples on both sides of the battle platform are stunned. They are buzzing in their minds. They don&amp;rsquo;t know what to say. They are full of pictures of the big dog crawling on beihanlie
Not only are they confused at the moment, but even the leaders on the terrace and the heads of the peaks, as well as the elders, are all stupidly looking at the innocent face of Bai Xiaochun on the battle platform below.</description>

      <description>Almost at the moment when Bai Xiaochun looked up, beihanlie, one of the five Tianjiao on the north bank, suddenly gave a smile. He was already handsome. At the moment, such a smile made many of the young disciples on the south bank shine brilliantly.
With a smile on his face, he patted the ferocious and ferocious nocturnal beast lying beside him, and walked forward. The nocturnal beast&amp;rsquo;s head shook, and his eyes showed a dark light, and he stood up.</description>

      <description>Almost at the moment when Zheng Yuandong&amp;rsquo;s words came out, all the disciples on both sides of the Taiwan Strait were shocked and subconsciously looked up at the terrace above.
Almost as soon as they saw it, there were four earthshaking thoughts of divine consciousness, which suddenly appeared from the top of Zhongdao mountain and the snow covered forbidden area, sweeping all the people.
After being swept away by these four divine senses, all the disciples of the outer sect, including Bai Xiaochun, trembled.</description>

      <description>As time went by, Bai Xiaochun was shut up in his residence and could not get out of the house. Ten days later, when the solemn bell echoed the whole clan gate, waves came from his jade slips.
The Tianjiao battle between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait was officially held on the 10th day after the qualification competition!
Every half of Jiazi&amp;rsquo;s outer gate Tianjiao battle is carried out on Zhongdao mountain.</description>

      <description>Bai Xiaochun was frightened all the way. He ran down the mountain or even out of the zongmen. He wandered around for a long time in the city outside the Zongshan gate of Lingxi.
&amp;ldquo;What to do.&amp;rdquo; Bai Xiaochun has a sad face. He is deeply aggrieved. When he thinks of it, it is clear that the bird came by himself and took the pill. But now he can&amp;rsquo;t explain it clearly, and elder Zhou is unreasonable</description>

      <description>Just when Zhou Xinqi was shocked, the wind came again from behind her. Zhou walked with a big stride and a smile on her face. She nodded to Zhou Xinqi when she passed by.
At the same time, with this smile, there was a vicious voice in my mouth.
&amp;ldquo;Bai Xiaochun, I changed my mind again. After catching you, I&amp;rsquo;ll starve for a month, and then I&amp;rsquo;ll lock you up with a group of birds and a large number of fierce animals!</description>

      <description>When Bai Xiaochun heard the roar, he was startled. He turned around and saw elder Zhou, who had rushed to kill him. His eyes suddenly widened, and he only felt that he was out of his wits.
In particular, Zhou Chang was ferocious. Although his words didn&amp;rsquo;t mean Bai Xiaochun&amp;rsquo;s life, he could feel the sadness of the Phoenix in person. When Bai Xiaochun thought that the Phoenix had almost all the birds in Xiangyun mountain all day, even the Lingwei chicken, he felt creepy.</description>

      <description>Not only did Zheng Yuandong notice Bai Xiaochun. After all, other people were in an uproar, but Bai Xiaochun stood beside the statue and posed as an elder. The temperament of the whole person was different, especially obvious.
&amp;ldquo;Bai Xiaochun has also reached the eighth floor of condensate gas, and even died in the first battle of the Luochen family. I think this son must be in the top ten today, and even hope to compete for the top five.</description>

      <description>In the past thousand years, the south bank has always been oppressed by the north bank. Most of the top ten disciples of the outer gate Tianjiao battle are the north bank disciples, which makes the south bank unable to raise its head, let alone the first place. For thousands of years, it has been taken away by the north bank.
Among them, there are four peaks on the north bank and three mountains on the south bank.</description>

      <description>Zhang Dazhou was nervous at the bottom of his heart. After hearing Bai Xiaochun saying that, he felt that there was some reason, so he nodded quickly.
&amp;ldquo;Yes, the master also said, let me not see failure and success. Junior brother nine, please go back to the room and try to be spiritual.&amp;rdquo; Zhang Dazhou coughs, so he said calmly.
Bai Xiaochun turned and walked quickly. After returning to the room, he saw the sword in his hand, frowned, worried about hitting Zhang Dazhou, and did not try it easily, but pinched the key and immediately appeared the tortoise pot.</description>

      <description>With enough spirit stones, Bai Xiaochun doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to think about the little turtle any more. His heart is full of wounds, so he can only be immersed in the medicine refining pavilion to recover slowly.
Gradually, the second-order elixir in Bai Xiaochun&amp;rsquo;s hands has been perfect, and the success rate has been raised to an amazing level. Only then did he begin to try to refine the third-order elixir.</description>

After a while, on Xiangyun mountain, Bai Xiaochun limped, his head was erect, his face was a little dark, and he crawled back to the yard with fear. At the thought of countless lightning chasing him, he felt a shiver in his heart and immediately swore that he would never fly in thunderstorm days.
It&amp;rsquo;s not flying, it&amp;rsquo;s playing with your life!
In the wooden house, Bai Xiaochun grinned, and it took a long time to settle down.</description>

      <description>On the south side of Xiangyun mountain, the pharmacist&amp;rsquo;s Pavilion is surrounded by green trees and a winding blue stone road, which connects with the main road of Xiangyun mountain. When there is no promotion assessment in this area, almost no one comes here. Only when there is a promotion assessment, can there be a large number of visitors.
In addition to the students to be assessed, most of them are friends of these people, or those who want to participate but feel uncertain.</description>

But today, around the alchemy Pavilion, the disciple who was guarding there suddenly stood up. In an instant, he found that countless ants appeared on the ground.</description>

      <description>Bai Xiaochun was excited. He got up and moved his body. He also controlled the small wooden sword to fly back and forth in the courtyard. Sometimes he quickly roared away, sometimes he stopped suddenly, which implied a sense of great importance.
The whole wooden sword is unpredictable in this yard, and soon forms bursts of sword spirit. It seems that a strong wind is blowing out of thin air, which makes Bai Xiaochun more excited here.</description>

Not only are the hearts of the people around complicated, even Du Lingfei is jealous of Bai Xiaochun&amp;rsquo;s luck. Chen Ziang and others are the same. The four of them have entered the top five, and each battle has its own consumption. If this time, the four of them have got the qualification of being in the air and have a rest, they will certainly have a great advantage in the later battles.</description>
