      <description>The rain stopped for the time being, but the dark clouds in the sky were still very low, layer by layer, which made people feel breathless.
The north gate of Heyang city was opened, and countless people poured out of the city and went northward. Crying was heard all the way. No one knows where the road ahead is?
Xiao Yicai led the disciples of Qingyun to maintain order all the way, constantly comforting the worried and panicked people, telling people around again and again that this time is just a temporary departure.</description>

      <description>The low hissing and roaring came from all directions. On the plain 200 miles away from Qingyun Mountain, more and more strange beasts gathered in southern Xinjiang, and some of them kept roaring to the sky. Among the herds, there are six or seven monsters, which are especially huge, far more than the surrounding ordinary beasts. They are standing in the herd and roaring, and the surrounding demons seem to be particularly afraid of them.</description>

      <description>In the early morning, when the sky was just bright, the sky around Qingyun Mountain was covered with dark clouds, and rain drops soon fell. The rain increased from a small age, and soon became gray between the sky and the earth. The sound of rain was everywhere, enveloping the towering mountains in a water mist, which was hazy and mysterious.
The sound of rain beating green bamboo leaves seems to have not changed for thousands of years, and it always seems lonely on Qingyun Mountain.</description>

      <description>In the face of the ghost, although Mr. ghost still did not appear from the coffin, he was obviously more cautious. The ghost fire in the air was silent burning, and gradually became bright and bigger, reflecting the faces around him turning green.
Staring at the dark green light, he stepped on a step without expression. Almost at the moment when the ghost&amp;rsquo;s body was moving, the ghost fire seemed to be stimulated by something, and suddenly it was full of light.</description>

      <description>Zhou Yixian and other three were shocked. In this gloomy night, they only felt that their backs were like thorns and their hair was standing up. A faint green fire in that room was burning quietly, and the light was slowly emanating from the cracks of the house. It was strange and unpredictable. With the sound of the night wind around, it was more and more like the sound of ghost crying.</description>

GUI Li silently looks at the Biyao lying on the ice stone platform, the woman sleeping in the curling white smoke. The corner of her mouth seems to always have a trace of smile. Can she still feel at the moment, but does she know that someone is guarding her side?
Or, in her heart, she had no regrets, so she fell asleep peacefully?
He never knew the answer and didn&amp;rsquo;t dare to think about it.</description>

The lingering shadow appeared in the face and heart of everyone in Huqi mountain.</description>

The door of the shrine was still open, and the cold night wind blew through, blowing out the burning candles on the hall, casting strange shadows on the ground. In the distance outside, in the silence, it seems that there is something whispering, crying, laughing, and it seems that the wind is blowing the trees, which makes people not really listen to it, but feel a little chilly in their hearts.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Get out of my way! &amp;ldquo;The Lich was silent for a long time and said slowly.
The evil spirit looked at him coldly and said, &amp;ldquo;don&amp;rsquo;t you regret before the goddess statue? &amp;quot;
The Lich&amp;rsquo;s black clothes moved slightly again. It seemed that he was very excited under the black clothes. However, he did not look back to see the stone statue woman.
&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m right. My mother is wrong! &amp;ldquo;He said in an astringent voice.</description>

      <description>Qilidong, an altar of Miao nationality.
The new day, as if even the sun shining on the altar platform, feel as if there is a new flavor. GUI Li and Xiao Bai stood on the platform in front of the altar in the middle of the mountain, looking at the land ravaged by the war.
Among the ruins that can be seen everywhere, Miao people come in and go out. From a high point of view, they are like ants busy for their own homes.</description>

The corner of his eyes twitched for a moment and said, &amp;ldquo;the five ethnic groups in southern Xinjiang have a large population. Why do you have to ask for help from an outsider?&amp;rdquo;
The great wizard shook his head and said in a bleak voice: &amp;ldquo;since the division of the five clans, the witchcraft has been declining day by day.</description>

Lying on the shoulder of the small ash, now seems to be a lot of quiet, as if the surrounding solemn atmosphere, let it also be honest.
Through the long corridor, to the stone house deep in the altar, the young wizard nodded slightly, did not say anything to them, turned around and walked away.</description>

Although the Dharma is high in humanity, he has been busy for a whole night, and there are some scorched marks on his body. Some disciples of the burning incense Valley who have a slightly lower level of Taoism also have some black ashes on their faces.</description>

Half an hour later, when he was sure that no foreign people would follow him, he slowly fell down to the cloud, returned to the ground, and landed in a valley.
At the moment, both the Li and the Miao are in a state of failure. However, ahetai seems not eager to find the remaining Li people.</description>

There was a knock on the door, but there was no one outside. Grimly frowned, walked over and opened the door.
Standing at the door was a 13-4-year-old Miao boy with a childish look on his face. He carried a basket in his hand with some meat, wine and vegetables in the middle. It seems that the leader of tumagu clan sent someone to deliver food.
The boy handed the basket over and nodded grimly, &amp;ldquo;thank you very much.</description>

Deep in the dark and silent hall, the still sober ghost and the great wizard did not speak. Only the burning fire made a crackling sound from time to time. In addition, in the quiet altar, there is a strange sound.

&amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re drunk.&amp;rdquo; When he said this, he couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but have a little sweat on his head.
Xiaobai&amp;rsquo;s body, at this moment, seems to have been completely unable to stand, all the weight is leaning on the ghost. But see her white teeth gently bit a red lip, lazy there is a trace of tender pity, the mouth of a low voice * *, as if hook people&amp;rsquo;s soul general amorous feelings, slowly, her head against the ghostly shoulder.</description>

Over time, the Inns that had not existed in southern Xinjiang also appeared in the most bustling towns under the influence of the Chinese and Turkish merchants.</description>

      <description>The dead swamp, the top of the great tree.
Lu Xueqi, FA Xiang, Lin Jingyu and Zeng Shushu slowly fell on a huge tree trunk which was in a mess. They saw cracks and numerous branches around. Even after a long time, they still made people shrug and move towards the fight between the two ancient giants.
But at this moment, their attention is obviously more focused on the people in front of them.</description>

      <description>He opened his eyes slowly in the dark.
Around a dark, and then, not far ahead, slowly lit up a faint light, like a faint candle in the night, quietly burning.
He looked at it silently. The light was light lavender, then turning blue, then slowly turning dark green. Then he kept changing and flashing all kinds of lights. It was very beautiful.
&amp;ldquo;Squeak, squeak&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;
All of a sudden, just beside him, there was the low voice of the little grey monkey.</description>

      <description>The trunk shakes even more. Even this incredible tree, under the huge body of black water snake, seems to be shaking.
It seems that it is an evil beast from ancient times. The black water black snake wraps its huge body around the trunk of the tree. Where it passes, its branches and leaves are in a mess, and the vines and flowers are withered and broken one after another. It wags its head and wags its tail to move forward.</description>

      <description>The wind blows, countless flowers shake together.
Lu Xueqi stood in the sea of flowers with no expression, silently looking at the ghost that landed opposite her.
Faint fragrance, dark floating.
Ghost Li lightly shrugged his shoulders, small ash swished from his shoulders, opened his eyes to see the master, looked at Lu Xueqi in the opposite direction, grabbed his head, and ran to one side.
His eyes fell on the tall stone gate behind Lu Xueqi, and he suddenly smiled and said, &amp;ldquo;this is what we are looking for?</description>

      <description>In addition to the dead water, on the ancient road to the West from Dawang village, on Monday, Xianhe and Xiaohuan walked slowly.
Xiaohuan&amp;rsquo;s bright eyes looked around, only to see that the ancient road was overgrown with weeds and desolate. I walked out of Dawang village for a long time, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t even see a human figure.
Looking from afar, I can see that this place is located in the wilderness.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s getting brighter.
The rain stopped and the wind stopped. The first light of the morning came down through the thick clouds in the sky and the mist floating in the dead water.
The forest is full of silence, but slowly, with the light, gradually began to make noise. In the unknown place, there was the first bird song. All of a sudden, the whole forest seemed to wake up from the deep sleep of the night, or far or near, full of early morning cheers, to welcome the new day.</description>

The rain is not big, and the sky is a little yellow. It has been raining for the second day in a row.
Xiao Yicai frowned tightly, turned his head suddenly, and said to the nearby man, &amp;ldquo;younger martial sister Yan, do you have any discovery?&amp;rdquo;
It was Yan Hong in the burning incense Valley who stood with him. Xiao Yicai entered the neize after all the people were separated in the miasma on that day.</description>

      <description>Qin Wuyan&amp;rsquo;s eyes turned, and he looked at the four people who were equal in law one by one. From his eyes, he naturally saw that these four people were outstanding talents. If he acted according to the real way, he was afraid that he would not get benefits from them.
It&amp;rsquo;s just that the ten thousand poisons sect has always been practicing the eccentric sword. There are so many strange methods or devious ways.</description>

Although Lin Jingyu and Zeng Shushu are not very familiar, they first get close to each other when they see their classmates in such a strange place. Secondly, he knows that Zeng Shushu and Zhang Xiaofan were good friends at that time.</description>

      <description>Dawang village.
Xiaohuan stood at the entrance of the village and looked at him with some worry. He saw only the direction of him. In the morning, there was still a clear sky. Now it was getting dark. It seemed that there would be another heavy rain.
Late last night, she and her grandfather, Zhou Xian and Jin pinger, were in the dead water together. But after Jin pinger went out for a visit, she looked very tired and sent them out of the dead water overnight.</description>

      <description>The night is dark and cold.
Suddenly, a ray of light crossed in the dark, flying quickly and incomparably from afar, but from afar, the light seemed to tremble faintly, showing signs of instability.
On the ground, Meng Ji is walking back and forth anxiously. Behind him are the remaining disciples of the longevity hall. Roughly speaking, there are about fifty or sixty people. They look scared one by one and look forward to the future.</description>

      <description>All of a sudden, things suddenly changed in the dark. The disciples of the longevity hall were shocked for a moment, and didn&amp;rsquo;t react immediately.
In this moment of lightning and stone fire, the people who had been prepared for the right path appeared one after another, and each of them controlled the magic weapon and killed them. It&amp;rsquo;s a great advantage to kill those who don&amp;rsquo;t want to. All the disciples here are excellent successors from all schools.</description>

      <description>The wild dog Taoist followed Guili and walked to the deep of the dead water.
Because just after a heavy rain, the soft land is now more muddy. But somehow, after meeting Qin Wuyan and Jin pinger just now, he insisted that he would not control the magic weapon again, but walk on the ground.
It seems that, like the Golden Vase, he is secretly afraid of something.
In the past, even though the wild dog Taoist didn&amp;rsquo;t swear, at least he complained.</description>

The fur on little grey monkey&amp;rsquo;s body is wet. It&amp;rsquo;s attached to his body. Now he curls up and hides in Xiao Huan&amp;rsquo;s arms motionless. He only has a pair of smart eyes. He still drips and turns. He looks at the distance and Xiao Huan.
The rain fell all over the sky, and the originally dark swamp was now more gray, and the surrounding area was gray.</description>

There is a faint path between the marshes where there are many weeds. It extends to the inside.
Zeng Shushu and other disciples of Qingyun sect stood at the entrance of the death swamp and looked inside.</description>

She carefully looked at the white paper in her hand, and the three words &amp;ldquo;Qin Wuyan&amp;rdquo; on it were written with neat workmanship, upright and mellow strokes, and the connection corner was introverted and smooth, which was quite beautiful.
Xiaohuan blinked, smiled suddenly, and said: &amp;ldquo;my guest, your name has&amp;rdquo; Yan &amp;ldquo;, which is the power of double fire to Yang, but in the middle of the word&amp;rdquo; no &amp;ldquo;to suppress, turning around, it&amp;rsquo;s Yin and soft; and the word&amp;rdquo; Qin &amp;ldquo;lies in the west, and the Lord, you go to the west, where it&amp;rsquo;s Yin and cold!</description>

The ghost King took his eyes away from the mirror like water, sighed a little, turned around, smiled and said, &amp;ldquo;I haven&amp;rsquo;t looked in the mirror for a long time, but I see more white hair today.&amp;rdquo;
Standing behind him, the ghost face was expressionless, and said lightly, &amp;ldquo;you have more than one heart.&amp;rdquo;

The cloud is ethereal in the mountains, like the gentle white ribbon, changing gently. In the early morning, the moist air and the fresh and cool wind swept over the green bamboo forest and the mountain top of Dazhu peak.
The building centered on Shoujing hall stands quietly in the morning light. Everything seems so peaceful
Just a burst of barking sound suddenly came, mixed with &amp;ldquo;squeak&amp;rdquo; in the middle, breaking the silence here.</description>

He couldn&amp;rsquo;t help shivering
Countless pairs of eyes staring at the figure, it is very poor and lonely, but he accidentally insisted, shaking hands holding the black heart, still very tight, very tight.
This appearance suddenly had some familiarity, as if many years ago, that stubborn and stoic young man had inexplicable persistence.</description>

In the wilderness, there is no village before and no village behind. There is only one ancient road extending from afar, and it extends to the distance alone.
In the dark clouds of the night sky, there was a low thunder sound, and the rain between the heaven and the earth gradually increased.</description>

When everyone was completely quiet, the Dharma phase slowly went on.

The haggard old man standing in front of the ancestral hall stared at the brilliant light and was stunned until Lin Jingyu asked him, &amp;ldquo;old master, is that the treasure of Qingyun sect, the ancient sword
The old man nodded silently, and suddenly turned around, as if he didn&amp;rsquo;t want to pay attention to anything more, and said in a low voice: &amp;ldquo;once the immortal is killed, it&amp;rsquo;s on the Qingyun Mountain.</description>

At the same time, there were several loud voices of Qingyun disciples outside the Yuqing hall, but only a few of them were brushed. It seemed that some high-ranking people came to fight against the sky. Then there were several thumps. Several Qingyun disciples fell in and rolled to the ground.
At the door, there are four figures. They are the four masters of the demon sect.
Yuyangzi and poison God stood in the middle, the ghost king and Sanmiao fairy stood on both sides, four people looked at the hall and walked in slowly.</description>

When Shuiyue and his three disciples came back, they saw that they were separated, but Zhang Xiaofan was still kneeling on the ground alone. Lu Xueqi seemed to hesitate for a moment, but after Shuiyue&amp;rsquo;s stern eyes swept over, she finally stood behind her in silence.

      <description>The bamboo shadow is whirling, and the sun is shining down, and it falls on the open space in the bamboo forest.
Zhang Xiaofan looked at the bamboo forest in the distance and said in a low voice: &amp;ldquo;actually, I sometimes think I&amp;rsquo;m stupid. Elder martial sister she obviously likes elder martial brother Qihao, but I still However, at that time, I saw her standing in front of Kui Niu, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t know what to think, so I rushed up.</description>

      <description>On the bamboo peak of Qingyun Mountain.
Zhang Xiaofan sat in his room, stunned.
It was a sunny afternoon. Soft light came from the window of the room and sprinkled on the bluestone floor inside. Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s because there&amp;rsquo;s some lazy breath in the air. The rhubarb and ash in this room are also a little lazy at the moment.
Rhubarb lies at Zhang Xiaofan&amp;rsquo;s feet, buries his head on his two front feet, his eyes are half closed, his ears are drooped down, his whole body is up and down, only his glossy tail swings from time to time.</description>

      <description>See blue clouds again.
When Zhang Xiaofan saw Qingyun Mountain again, it was several months since he went down with Lu Xueqi, Qi Hao and Zeng Shushu last time.
The mountain, which is still towering and straight into the cloud, is still ethereal and solemn, but Zhang Xiaofan&amp;rsquo;s situation has completely changed.
After discussing with Taoist Cangsong and xiaoyicai, Zhang Xiaofan was temporarily taken back to dazhufeng by Tian, and Taoist Cangsong and xiaoyicai went back to report to Taoist XuanZhen, the leader, in detail, before making a decision.</description>

      <description>This dream seems to have passed another millennium.
He walked alone in the dark until he saw the village, where the sun was shining and familiar. He galloped away, the familiar faces smiling at him, joking.
The fresh air seemed sweet to his heart. He could not help rolling freely on the grass near the village and laughing heartily.
All around, suddenly, there were many more children, who rushed over. The always bright surprised feather laughed and said, &amp;ldquo;do you agree with this, or not?</description>

The red light flashed, and Tian linger was shocked. However, he saw the red light around the dark red iron tap trembling, but it was still under the protection of the red light.
In a moment, all the people around had already responded. The people in black rushed to Tian ling&amp;rsquo;er one after another.</description>

The sea breeze comes, along with the whistling, reverberates in this late night.

      <description>In the forest in the middle of the night, the light that has been emitted by countless magic weapons is like the day. From the depths of the forest to the most intense open space, it seems that there are sharp lights flying everywhere. Under the colorful and beautiful light, the bright red blood is constantly rising and sprayed on the slightly trembling trees.
It coagulates into blood beads and drips silently.</description>

The white faced scholar standing next to him looked at him.</description>

As soon as his hands vibrated, the red flashing skull in front of him &amp;ldquo;whine&amp;rdquo; across the air, flying rapidly around him, and his eyes began to turn red.

      <description>This hideous old man is an old devil in the demon sect who has been hidden for many years. He is called &amp;ldquo;the blood sucking ancestor&amp;rdquo;. People in the right way, including many people in the demon sect, privately call him &amp;ldquo;the blood sucking old devil&amp;rdquo;. The main reason for this is that the &amp;ldquo;blood sucking method&amp;rdquo; of the evil sect he practiced is to suck the blood essence of the living people into the body before he can practice it, which is very strange and terrible.</description>

      <description>When the atmosphere began, it seemed a little depressed. Tian could not slowly straighten his body. His face was cloudy and clear, and he could not see what he was thinking.
Xiao Yicai was silent for a while and said, &amp;ldquo;Uncle Tian, I&amp;rsquo;ve been hesitating about this for a long time, but I can&amp;rsquo;t keep it from you.&amp;rdquo;
Tian could not breathe deeply and nodded, &amp;ldquo;I know what you mean, nephew Xiao.</description>

      <description>Zhang Xiaofan looks at the middle-aged scholar in front of him, the &amp;ldquo;ghost king&amp;rdquo; who is suffering from serious problems. His mind is in chaos. These days, from time to time in his heart, he has little doubts about his past beliefs, which are actually rooted in a conversation in the tea stall at the foot of kongsang mountain.
Now, seeing the old man again, this mood is really complicated, which almost makes him forget the situation here and now for a while.</description>

A group of people from the demon sect, who were just loud, immediately calmed down when they saw Baguio coming out. They seemed to be very afraid of Baguio. Even the wild dog Taoist who looks like he is not afraid of the earth has no voice at the moment.
For a moment, no one dared to speak to her.</description>

A light shout, Zhang Xiaofan woke up from a dream, panted in the dark, and felt his whole body was wet with cold sweat.
These days, it seems that Zhang Xiaofan suddenly began to dream about his childhood nightmare when he heard the words &amp;ldquo;general wisdom&amp;rdquo; mentioned by FA Xiang. The scene of the village, which was deeply engraved in his heart, rushed to him, as if to swallow him up.</description>

Zhang Xiaofan has been kneeling at the entrance of the cave for nearly six hours. Most of the disciples of other sects have gone to sleep. Even the last light in the dazhufeng cave, which was lit at the end of the day, has gradually died out.
In the cave, Tian didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to say a word. Tian linger almost immediately called out, &amp;ldquo;Dad!</description>

A little disciple of Qingyun sect, who is not in the mainstream, dare to question the morality handed down by his ancestors. It&amp;rsquo;s beyond his capacity.

Looking at the jade and the stone, he found that their faces were not very good-looking either. I think they had never experienced such a scene before.
However, the countless creatures around them did not make any action to attack them. Apart from a few angry tigers and leopards roaring twice, there was basically no movement, just watching in silence.</description>

Stone beside see Zhang Xiaofan look some strange, strange way: &amp;ldquo;Xiaofan, who is this person?&amp;rdquo;

      <description>It was not easy to shake the dirt under his feet. Zhang Xiaofan turned around and saw that the little girl had come to the old man&amp;rsquo;s side. At the moment, she said something gently to the old man. The old man listened, nodded slightly and smiled.
Zhang Xiaofan blushed, wondering if they were laughing at him there, hesitated for a moment, or walked over and said, &amp;ldquo;old gentleman, what do you mean when you just said I have a fierce face?</description>

      <description>Zhang Xiaofan looked deeply at the middle-aged scholar who called himself &amp;ldquo;ten thousand people&amp;rdquo; in front of him, with a bad premonition in his heart, but at the same time, there was another power in his heart, which made him involuntarily ask: &amp;ldquo;please give me some advice.&amp;rdquo;
Ten thousand people took a deep look at him, and said slowly, &amp;ldquo;the black short stick is very powerful. The black light is moist and introverted.</description>

      <description>When Zhang Xiaofan woke up, it was already dark. I was afraid that she had slept for at least five or six hours, but Biyao was still awake. She held his clothes tightly with both hands, and looked like a frightened and timid child. No one wanted to get her. She was actually an important thing in the demon cult!
Zhang Xiaofan put his hand under his head and listened to the &amp;ldquo;whirling&amp;rdquo; sound of the trees blowing by the mountain wind in the forest.</description>

      <description>This past event of Biyao seems to her to be a deep pain. She has been deeply buried in her heart in recent years. Unexpectedly, at this critical moment of life and death, she looks back again. Her mind is agitated. In addition, her food is scarce and her body is weak these days. She has been in a coma for a long time.
Zhang Xiaofan looks at the young devil cult girl who is still clinging to her sleep.</description>

      <description>After that terrible nonsense, I don&amp;rsquo;t know whether Zhang Xiaofan&amp;rsquo;s body was originally strong, or whether Biyao&amp;rsquo;s comfort had an effect. The high fever that had been going on gradually subsided. Zhang Xiaofan&amp;rsquo;s mind slowly recovered, and people were awake, but the illness was still not light, mostly lying down and resting.
On this day, Baguio wandered in the cave without any business. Finally, she went to the four sentences left by Mrs.</description>

      <description>After a pause, Biyao looked at them carefully again, and saw that the strokes of these four lines were more meticulous, which was quite different from the Tianshu stone carving in the stone room just now. It seemed that it was the work of another person.
But the meaning of this is like the words of an infatuated woman, but how can it appear in the &amp;ldquo;blood hole&amp;rdquo; of this demon sect?</description>

      <description>I saw Biyao stand up and take a look at Zhang Xiaofan. He looked elsewhere and stood still. His brow frowned, but he didn&amp;rsquo;t say anything. He said lightly, &amp;ldquo;let&amp;rsquo;s go!&amp;rdquo;
Zhang Xiaofan had some good feelings for the woman when he came in the tunnel, but when he saw these two evil gods, he thought of the difference between the sects and the teachings of his teacher since he was a child.</description>

      <description>Zhang Xiaofan didn&amp;rsquo;t expect that Biyao had such a big reaction. She was shocked and pointed to the top of the cave and said, &amp;ldquo;there are some red stones&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;
Biyao immediately approached and looked at the top of the cave. Sure enough, through the water drop, there were seven and a half palm sized red stones inlaid in the top of the cave. The texture of the stone was the same as the stone beside, except for the color.</description>

      <description>The waves of the merciless sea gradually subsided, but the fear in the hearts of the people did not abate at all. The huge body of the black water black snake is coiled in front of the eyes, standing there like a demon from ancient times.
It seems that the snake head of this behemoth is slightly swinging. I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect to encounter the breath of living people in the lifeless abyss.</description>

      <description>At this time, the young girl also saw Zhang Xiaofan and Lu Xueqi, who were still unconscious beside him. Obviously, she didn&amp;rsquo;t expect that there were still living people under the lifeless abyss. When her face changed, she was surprised.
Then, she saw Zhang Xiaofan&amp;rsquo;s face clearly, stupefied for a while, a trace of surprise flitted across her face, and then she smiled.
&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s true that we don&amp;rsquo;t meet each other in life!</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Zheng&amp;rdquo;!
It was a crackle in the dark!
Lu Xueqi&amp;rsquo;s face was as cold as frost, and she stood in front of Zhang Xiaofan and pulled out her sword.
Out of the sheath!
Blue light, pure and brilliant light, reflects the dark world.
In an instant, all the dark lights of the spirits lost their luster in front of the blue light. However, the spirits seemed to be fearless and rushed from all directions.</description>

      <description>According to the legend, the world was originally dark. In the following forty-eight thousand years, there was Pangu, a giant god, who opened up the world and turned mountains and rivers. In another forty-eight thousand years, Nuwa made people.
According to legend, the first light between heaven and earth is born in the darkest place.
Zhang Xiaofan only felt that his whole body was cold and cold into the bone marrow, as if it was not only his body, but also his heart, and he was going to die.</description>

      <description>Zhang Xiaofan watched them fall into trouble, and rushed up at once. In his eyes, the big man turned his head slightly and shot out a red light, rushing to Zhang Xiaofan.
Zhang Xiaofan has no way to go back. Although Qi Hao and Zeng Shushu are in his eyes, they can&amp;rsquo;t do anything when it comes to the end. So he has to sacrifice the fire stick to meet them.</description>

      <description>In the distance behind, the roaring and fighting sound was heard all the time, and the light was shining. It was obvious that the three of Qingyun sect were fighting fiercely with other demons in the dark. But here, Zhang Xiaofan suddenly fell into a strange silence.
Zhang Xiaofan was stunned, but the owner of the Yellow flying sword and the gray tusk in the dark witnessed the strange scene with his own eyes.</description>

      <description>The Dharma phase stood in front of him and whispered a Buddha&amp;rsquo;s name. A moment later, a round bead flashing with Zhuang&amp;rsquo;s serious Mu Jinguang sacrificed from his hand. At first, the light seemed to be attached to the Dharma phase. But with the urging of Dharma phase, the golden light was very prosperous. The golden light rushed to all directions like tide water with the bead as the center. Zhang Xiaofan stood in the same place and almost mistakenly felt the &amp;ldquo;shout&amp;rdquo; in his ear Roaring, the Golden Circle of light had passed by him.</description>

      <description>Four people finally came out of the mountain of bat corpses, but they were all in a mess. They were covered with filthy and dark blood. Even the smell was very bad.
All four of them are from Qingyun family. They are always clean, especially Lu Xueqi from xiaozhufeng. At this moment, it&amp;rsquo;s worse than cutting her three knives.
The four of them are busy walking to the distance. At the moment, they just want to be as far away from the disgusting bat corpse as possible.</description>

At the moment, he saw that she was still dressed in a suit of water green clothes, and her skin was like snow, beautiful and fairy like under the moonlight.
The young girl put the newly folded flowers on her nose and inhaled deeply. Her face was intoxicated and even more breathtaking.</description>

Immortal daoxuan looked at the four people in the hall and said with a smile, &amp;ldquo;let the four of you come here today.</description>

Xiaohui naturally won&amp;rsquo;t say anything to Zhang Xiaofan, but &amp;ldquo;squeak&amp;rdquo; twice. Look at its monkey face. The owner is hurt. Not only is he not worried about it, but he looks more like gloating.</description>

The wind is strong, and the clouds are whirling. Thunder rumbled, electricity darted.
Zhang Xiaofan deceiving himself to fly in, the dark light of the fire staff flickers, which is noticeable under the dark clouds. Lu Xueqi looks at Zhang Xiaofan&amp;rsquo;s figure in the green light, and her jade face is white.</description>

Zhang Xiaofan couldn&amp;rsquo;t sleep, and the monkey Xiaohui beside him also opened his eyes, blinked at him. As for other senior brothers, they had already snored a lot, that is rhubarb. Now they are sleeping on the ground.
Moonlight, like water, came in through the window and sprinkled on the ground like frost and snow.
Zhang Xiaofan stealthily gets up, and Xiaohui rushes into his arms.</description>

Tian is not easy to walk in front of Su Ru. Zhang Xiaofan&amp;rsquo;s injury seems to get better overnight. He looks flattered when he walks among the people.

The brilliant light of amber and Zhuling and the endless blue light of Tianya divine sword make it look like a fairyland on earth, which is extremely beautiful. But what is more beautiful is the two young women who are flying in and out of the clothes. From morning till now, an hour has passed, and the two sides still haven&amp;rsquo;t won.</description>

Zhang Xiaofan looked into the kitchen carefully, only to find that it was much more spacious and bright than dazhufeng&amp;rsquo;s kitchen. He looked at it carefully and said, &amp;ldquo;although I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen them in the morning, I guess it&amp;rsquo;s mostly here!</description>

After a careful inspection, he found that he was in good condition and showed no signs of poisoning. It seemed that he was severely damaged by the magic weapon of the immortal family and his inner organs were severely shaken.
He frowned, stood up and looked at Zhang Xiaofan.</description>

Under the stage, Taoist Cangsong clenched his fists and said coldly, &amp;ldquo;sister Shuiyue, you are really cruel. It&amp;rsquo;s not enough to win, but you have to rely on the magic weapon to produce and destroy other people&amp;rsquo;s immortal swords.</description>

Suddenly, Zhang Xiaofan was slapped heavily on the shoulder.
Zhang Xiaofan&amp;rsquo;s whole attention is focused on Tian linger, who is going away. He doesn&amp;rsquo;t notice the situation around him at all. He is shocked. The whole person jumps aside and looks at it in a twinkling of an eye, but it&amp;rsquo;s Zeng Shushu that he just knew in the morning.
I saw Zeng Shushu smiling and relaxed, looking up and down at Zhang Xiaofan, and then my eyes moved to the monkey Xiaohui beside him.</description>

The man was caught off guard and almost caught his face. Fortunately, he responded quickly, and he tilted his head back, hiding from it when he could not let it go.
Zhang Xiaofan was taken aback, quickly stopped Xiaohui, and turned to look at the man.</description>
