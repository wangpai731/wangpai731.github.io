      <p>I saw at the edge of the Bishuitan, the water beast that had been sleeping fast, suddenly woke up, turned around fiercely, his huge eyes showed endless fierce light, the hair roots on his back were raised, and a blood basin was opened. Big mouth, showing two long sharp fangs, actually put on an attacking gesture. And its goal is the disciples of Qingyunmen standing on the steps.</p>
<p>This water unicorn is a wilderness spirit, an ancient beast, this power, I suddenly saw the change of wind and clouds, the blue sky had darkened in an instant, and as it took the first step to the steps, it was originally calm. The mountain breeze turned into a violent wind, screaming sharply, rolling over the peak of the sky. In the Bishuitan, which is the closest to the water unicorn, the water surface changed even more. From the level of the wave, it began to tremble, and then suddenly turned violently. The entire pool of water spun rapidly, turning out a deep vortex around the center. Deep in the vortex, there seemed to be a rumbling sound. After a while, the crowd only heard a loud noise, and a column of water rose from the depths of the vortex. The three of them embraced thickly, and they were condensed but not scattered. They made a turn in the air, and they fell in the air, as if they were receiving something. Like driving, it fell in front of the water unicorn, as if it were a dragon, crystal clear, swimming in the air.</p>
<p>At this time, all the Qingyunmen who stood on the steps, including Qi Hao and others who were the most sophisticated, no longer remained calm, all changed their colors, and some even paled and trembling slightly.</p>
<p>The reason why the water unicorn can be a powerful help for the green leaf ancestors in removing the demon and the demon thousands of years ago, and was respected by the Qingyun Gate for thousands of years, its strength is fully revealed at this moment. Among the five elements of gold, wood, water, fire, and earth, the water unicorn is the superb spirit of the water system. Just looking at its ability to control water out of thin air, it has no power to call out the thick and condensed water column, even Wandering in mid-air without endless effortless look, strong spiritual power, pure mindfulness, has far surpassed the ordinary man of self-cultivation, it is the master of the Qingyun Gate, not to say pure pure mindfulness At this point, there are few people who can obtain this level by using the treasure.</p>
<p>At this moment, but when the world was dark and the storms were tumbling, the disciples of Qingyun Gate saw Ling Zunshui Qilin suddenly had no thunder rage for more than a thousand years, and they were all stunned and overwhelmed. When I was talking about time and time, I saw Shui Qilin&rsquo;s mouth roaring, his eyes widened, and the color of anger and hatred in his eyes became stronger and stronger. It seemed that he felt something deeply hatred or extreme hatred, and he had to fight against it with death. And the large water column hovering in front of this giant monster is also moving faster and faster. Suddenly, there was a loud noise, &ldquo;boom&rdquo;, the huge water column with endless momentum, overwhelming the green cloud disciples on the steps.</p>
<p>At this critical moment, I only heard a cry from mid-air: &ldquo;Ling Zun breathes anger!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A dark green figure appeared as if it appeared out of thin air, and suddenly appeared in midair between Shui Qilin and Qingyun disciples. I haven’t seen him for five years. His crane bones haven’t changed at all. It’s just that his brows are tight at the moment. Obviously, he is also extremely puzzled by the sudden problem of Shui Qilin, but the situation is urgent. Behind him is the best young man among dozens of Qingyunmen. The disciple, and the waves of light in the water column roaring in front of him, the shadows of all kinds of fierce monsters are faintly revealed, apparently the fierce beasts killed by the water unicorn in the past, and the soul was ingested into the body by the water unicorn after death. At this moment, it was driven by the water unicorn in the water column, and it was more powerful. With Dao Xuan Zhenren&rsquo;s ability to penetrate the sky and earth, he was also shocked.</p>
<p>Seeing that the water column was approaching, Dao Xuan avoided inevitable and had to take a deep breath. He recited in his mouth: &ldquo;Numerous Tianzun!&rdquo; His hands were raised and he held the ball in the void. I drew a tai chi picture in a virtual way. In a moment, the pattern glowed in the sky, and the white light bursts, the air was full of vigor, and immediately Daoxuan turned back, and the dark green robe on his body drummed himself without a wind. Huo Ran floated down from him, and the tai chi picture in the air immediately If driven, he rushed on the robe, and then it was burnt on the robe at that time. This dark green robe appeared to be a treasure of the fairy family. After receiving the tai chi picture, when he cried, the wind would grow, and it would be ten times larger in a moment. Not only, across the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow&rdquo;, with a loud sound, the water column of Shui Qilin Emperor hit the magnificent dark green robe, only to hear the roaring in the water column, it seemed that the monsters and souls screamed out loudly. Backed a few feet away, the center of the robe that was hit by the water column bulged deeper, and the force was huge.</p>
<p>The young disciples of Qingyun, who were almost dumbfounded on the steps, only felt that a strong wind suddenly came, and all of them were unsteady. In addition to a few deep practitioners, they also barely supported. Most people actually fell left and right. Everyone couldn&rsquo;t help but lose sight of it. If there was no Daoxuan Zhenren&rsquo;s shot to block the water unicorn&rsquo;s thunder blow, I really don&rsquo;t know what the consequences would be.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s face was pale, and he was unsteady, and he fell to the side. Lin Jingyu saw in the corner of his eye that he just wanted to reach out to help, but he turned to the other side, but he turned to the other side.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was shocked, and unconsciously let go of his hand holding the &ldquo;burning stick&rdquo; in his arms, desperately reaching out to find a place to support it, and did not notice that his hand left the burning stick. The cold feeling disappeared.</p>
<p>In the air, Daoxuan Zhenren&rsquo;s face was solemn, and he was waiting for him. But behind him, &ldquo;brush, brush, brush&rdquo; appeared a few times, and more than a dozen figures appeared. The volley stood behind him, headed by Cangsong real person, and the rest were The first of the six veins and the elders of each vein, Tian Nan and Su Ru are among them, and each looks serious.</p>
<p>Qingyunmen masters are here at this moment. Looking at the world, anyone who encounters this kind of situation is afraid of seven points first, but this water unicorn looks at the first elder of the deep head of the Qingyunmen, and there is no fear at all. Color, but under the eyes of everyone, Shui Qilin&rsquo;s eyes, which were originally burnt in anger, calmed down suddenly, showing a strange look, seeming puzzled, and the huge water column in front of him slowly shrank and finally lost. Controlling and falling to the ground, &ldquo;La La La&rdquo; made the ground wet.</p>
<p>At this time, the water unicorn had no momentum, but the huge body stood on the spot, which was still quite scary. I saw it ignored the elders in the air, and his eyes only stared at the young disciples on the steps, his eyes swept. , And sniffed in the air with his nose again, as if he didn&rsquo;t smell anything. After a long while, after this weird behavior was repeated many times, the water unicorn seemed to finally give up, shook its huge head, turned around, walked to another open space, and lay down. , Leaning your head on your legs, squinting your eyes, and after a while, there was another snoring sound.</p>
<p>Everyone at Qingyun Gate looked at each other, dumbfounded.</p>
<p>The Cangsong Taoist recovered as quickly as possible, and quietly moved to Dao Xuanzhen, whispering, &ldquo;Brother Master, it is not appropriate to let disciples stay here more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tao Xuan awakened, glanced at Cangsong, and nodded, said: &ldquo;You take the disciples up first, I&rsquo;ll go and see what happened to Lingzun?&rdquo; After finishing his body, he flew towards the water unicorn.</p>
<p>Cangsong turned around and said loudly: &ldquo;Lingzun just gave you a joke just now. You don&rsquo;t have to be nervous. Now all the disciples who participated in the Wuwu Test will go to the Yuqing Hall in turn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A group of disciples responded in unison, restored order, and walked up. But in my heart, seeing the shocking blow of Shui Qilin just now, I&rsquo;m afraid that few people would believe it was a joke.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Following behind everyone, Zhang Xiaofan and Lin Jingyu entered the majestic and spacious Yuqing Hall. Standing inside the hall, Zhang Xiaofan suddenly felt that the memories of five years turned up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jing Yu.&rdquo; Zhang Xiaofan whispered suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Lin Jingyu looked at Zhang Xiaofan.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan said in a low voice, &ldquo;I suddenly remembered something. Have you seen Uncle Wang in the past few years?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu&rsquo;s face suddenly dimmed, and he shook his head immediately: &ldquo;No, today is also my first time to return to Tongtianfeng. Three years ago I asked Brother Qi Hao about the situation of Uncle Wang Er, and I heard him say that he was still insane. , Running around Tongtian Peak all day, but there is no problem with the care of the brothers of the long door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was silent for a while and said: &ldquo;When the comparison is over this time, I want to see him. Do you go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu nodded and said, &ldquo;Okay, I also want to see him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment, suddenly the green shadow flashed above the hall, but Daoxuan Zhenren flashed in from outside. The eyes of the elders of Qingyun Gate all fell on him. Cangsong Taoist walked and asked, &ldquo;Brother Master, Spirit Venerable&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Daoxuan raised his hand to stop and gave him a wink. Cangsong Taoist immediately understood it and said nothing. Then Daoxuan Zhenren turned around casually, and Yan Yue said to the dozens of Qingyunmen young disciples standing in the hall: &ldquo;Everyone is here, okay, okay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The disciples bowed down to salute together and said, &ldquo;I have seen the real person in charge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dao Xuan Zhenren smiled slightly, walked back to his seat, and glanced at Cangsong Taoist. Cangsong Taoist then stepped forward and said loudly, &ldquo;You, you are all leaders of the younger generation of Qingyunmen. So far, it has been more than two thousand years. It is really the orthodox Taoist leader. But the ancients said: karma is industrious and indifferent. There is also a cloud: sailing against the current, and retreating if you don’t advance. People, and supporting young disciples, passed down the grand event of Qimai Huiwu, which has now been twenty years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; there was a burst of exclamation among the disciples of Qingyunmen. For the 20th session, one Jiazi counted for one thousand two hundred years.</p>
<p>The Cangsong Taoist people looked at the people&rsquo;s reaction with satisfaction, and said, &ldquo;Today, my Qingyunmen, under the leadership of Brother Dao Xuan, is thriving and prosperous, far superior to the previous life, and there are countless outstanding people among the younger generation. After the first consultation between the brothers and the various veins, the number of large-scale trials was increased to 64, so as not to regret the relics of the sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hearing this, Zhang Xiaofan couldn’t help but look to Tian, ​​and it was difficult for Tian to sit under Daoxuan Zhenren without expression, but with an impatient look in his eyes. After all, the increase in the number of contestants was said to be the first in every vein. Negotiations, in fact, it is not Daoxuan real person and Cangsong real person have the final say.</p>
<p>Only the Cangsong Taoist then said: &ldquo;This time, the number of people has doubled, so there are some changes in the lottery. Please see you,&rdquo; said, he pointed his hand over the open space on the right side of the hall, everyone saw Going, I saw a big mahogany box placed there, boxy, and only a small hole was opened on the upper side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the mahogany box, there are sixty-three wax pills, each of which is wrapped with a note, and the numbers from one to sixty-three are written on it,&rdquo; the disciples suddenly made a noise, and the Taoist Taoist ignored it and said : &ldquo;After the lottery is completed, the comparison will be based on the numbers, and the number one will be sixty-four, two pairs sixty-three, three pairs sixty-two, and so on. In the second round, the numbers one and sixty The four winners, and so on to the winners of No. 2 and No. 63, until the final battle. Do you understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The disciples of Qingyunmen standing under the hall were silent for a while, and suddenly someone shouted, &ldquo;Ask Uncle Cangsong, there are obviously 64 people, but why are there only 63 wax pills?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cangsong Taoist seemed to have prepared for this problem long ago, and coughed, saying: &ldquo;The rules of this competition were originally nine people from each of the seven veins of Qingyunmen, of which there was one more person from the Nagato, but, cough, because there is one There were only eight disciples in Maitongmen, so there was one less person, so there were only sixty-three.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a time, everyone&rsquo;s eyes fell on Da Zhufeng&rsquo;s first Tian Yi&rsquo;s face. Tian Yi&rsquo;s face flashed a rage, but he sat in place and did not move at all. The clamor of the Qingyunmen disciples came to an end, and there was a lot of discussion.</p>
<p>When everyone&rsquo;s voice calmed down a bit, Cangsong real talent said right: &ldquo;But this is not a difficult thing. Of the sixty-three wax pills, as long as one of the disciples wins the number one, it is extremely lucky, because There are no opponents on the 64th, so he has a bye in the first round.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as this remark came out, there was another uproar among the disciples of Qingyunmen, but Qingyunmen was a famous school after all, and the tutoring was strict. Although this method seemed quite funny, there was no objection.</p>
<p>Dao Xuanzhen stood up and looked around. His respected master was silent all around. Dao Xuanzhen nodded his head and said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, let&rsquo;s go to draw lots.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Above the main hall, everyone’s eyes fell on the mahogany box. First, Nagato walked out of the nine disciples, and walked next to the box, and each took out a pill of wax, then Longshoufeng A disciple.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu greeted Zhang Xiaofan and went out. Zhang Xiaofan glanced at his back and then looked at the first seven seats and the elders. Among these people, from Dao Xuan Zhenren, Cangsong Taoist, Tianyun Taoist, Shang Zhengliang, Zeng Shuchang, etc., the first one he had seen five years ago, only one sitting on the last chair on the right The female Dao Gu never met, but looking like this, it is probably the famous Shuiyue Master who is the famous Xiaozhufeng.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan often listened to his brother-in-law when talking about this uncle, and heard that Xiaozhufeng was the only one who only accepted female disciples in Qingyun Gate. Master Shuiyue&rsquo;s own deeds were also very deep, and he was very famous in Qingyun Gate. The disciples from Xiaozhufeng have also performed well in all the seven-pulse meetings and martial arts tests.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan glanced at Master Shuiyue for a few more times, only to see that she looked about thirty or so, similar to the sister-in-law Su Ru. She had an oval face, thin eyebrows and nose, a pair of apricot eyes, she was wearing a white robe. Going is actually graceful. But behind her, there is no elder generation standing, but a female disciple standing in white clothes like snow, with a beautiful appearance, carrying a long sword behind her, the sheath of the sword and the handle is sky blue, and the color is bright, There is a faint wave of light faintly, and at first glance it is a treasure of the fairy family.</p>
<p>He was looking at himself. The young woman seemed to feel his gaze, and suddenly turned her head, her gaze was like electricity, staring at Zhang Xiaofan coldly. Zhang Xiaofan felt a shock in his heart, as if he was shocked by electric shock. He was startled, his face reddish, but when he saw the woman&rsquo;s expressionless face, but there was a contempt in his eyes, he quickly lowered his head. At this embarrassing moment, someone suddenly reached over and pulled him, only listening to Tian Ling&rsquo;er&rsquo;s voice: &ldquo;Xiaofan, what are you stupid, let&rsquo;s go to the lottery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan hurriedly said, &ldquo;Yes, yes.&rdquo; Then he dared not take a glance at Master Shuiyue and turned to follow Tian Ling&rsquo;er to the red wooden box. At this time, only Dazhufeng and Xiaozhufeng were left in the main hall, and the lottery was not drawn. Dazhufeng, headed by Song Daren, walked to the box in turn, pulled out the wax pill, and then walked back to the hall. Afterwards, while everyone was checking what number they had drawn, Xiaozhu Feng stepped out of the vein with eight female disciples Wen Min also among them, and the woman in white standing behind Master Shuiyue bowed her head to Master Shuiyue. , Master Shuiyue nodded and said, &ldquo;You go too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman in white responded with a cry, walked among the daughters of Xiaozhufeng, smiled with the men of Wenmin, and walked to the mahogany box together, and pulled out the last nine wax pills.</p>
<p>At the moment, above the main hall, all the disciples checked the wax pill, and the elders of the veins sitting on the head could not help getting nervous. Their eyes were fixed on the disciples of the main vein, hoping that the disciples would draw a good sign. The &ldquo;One&rdquo; note is naturally better.</p>
<p>As if responding to the mood of the teachers, the young disciples of Qingyunmen under the hall uttered their voices one by one: &ldquo;Ah, I am twenty-six.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m thirty-three, hey, how much are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m forty-seven, I don&rsquo;t know what number the opponent is, I count&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>I just watched the disciples talk for a long time, but no one said that they had drawn the precious No. 1 note.</p>
<p>Cangsong Taoist frowned, coughed twice, and said loudly, &ldquo;Who got the number one sign?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His voice was loud, and all voices were suppressed for a while. There was silence in the hall for a long time. There was a small voice among the crowd, with a trace of surprise and caution, which seemed to be a tone that he did not even believe. Back, back to Uncle Cangsong, here, here with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When everyone looked at it together, they were stunned and saw Zhang Xiaofan standing in the crowd, holding a note in his hand, staying in place, but his sight was not easy for Tian, ​​timid and authentic.</p>
