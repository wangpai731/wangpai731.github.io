      <p>At this time, everyone in the hall was talking, as if talking about something. The young priest who led Zhang Xiaofan and Lin Jingyu came to the front of the door in a robe, and said in courtesy: &ldquo;Master, fellow uncles, disciples often arrows, ordered two young&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t finish his words. Suddenly above the sacred and solemn hall, a shouting cry broke out, interrupting him: &ldquo;Ghost, evil spirit! Ghost!&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chang Jian was taken aback, but Zhang Xiaofan and Lin Jingyu were even more surprised. Although the voice was sharp and unpleasant, it was very familiar. Zhang Xiaofan couldn&rsquo;t care so much, he rushed into the palace and shouted loudly, &ldquo;Uncle Wang, Uncle Wang, are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In his anxiety, there was a bit of anxiety and a bit of crying in the shout, and everyone felt a little unbearable in his eyes. I saw a middle-aged man dressed as a woodcutter in the corner of the side of the main hall behind the crowd. He held his head in his hands and curled up tightly in the corner. His whole body shivered. From the gap between the pens and handwritings, he said, &ldquo;ghost, ghost&hellip; &hellip;.&ldquo;the sound of.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan and Lin Jingyu, who followed in, immediately recognized this person as a woodcutter in the village of Caomiao, with the surname Wang, the second child, a kind person, who laughed all day, and was also great for their class of children. In addition to firewood, he will bring some wild fruits to the children.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan didn&rsquo;t think about it, rushed over, ran to Uncle Wang&rsquo;s shoulders, and firmly grasped his shoulders, shouting: &ldquo;Uncle Wang, what happened? Why are everyone in the village dead? And, my mother, My father, how are they? You say!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle Wang heard Zhang Xiaofan questioning in a pile of sounds, seeming to be touched, and temporarily stopped saying the words &ldquo;ghost, ghost&rdquo;, slowly raised his head and looked at Zhang Xiaofan in front of him.</p>
<p>All the people in the hall shook their heads, and all of them were quiet. Even the people sitting on the chairs couldn&rsquo;t help but stood up and looked at it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that Uncle Wang&rsquo;s eyes are red, all in fear and confusion. He looked at Zhang Xiaofan for a long while, but he didn&rsquo;t say a word, frowning tightly, what seemed to be thinking about it?</p>
<p>At this time, someone in the Qingyun Gate couldn&rsquo;t help but take a step and was about to speak, but was quietly pulled by the person beside him.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan saw that Uncle Wang had not responded for a long time, but just looked at himself deadly. He was very anxious in his heart and said loudly: &ldquo;Uncle Wang, what&rsquo;s wrong with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, Uncle Wang shouted loudly, shivering all over his body, and his face was terrified, and the whole person suddenly rolled to the side, rolling his hands with his head, shrunk into a ball, and kept wailing in his mouth: &ldquo;Ghost, ghost, Ghost!&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a sudden sigh in the hall, all the faces of the Qingyun Gate were disappointed, and those who had just stood up sat down again. Zhang Xiaofan was still to be questioned, but was caught by Lin Jingyu on the side.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan didn&rsquo;t answer his head, but saw tears in Lin Jingyu&rsquo;s eyes, and said sadly: &ldquo;Useless, he is crazy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan banged in his head, stunned in the area, and could not make a sound.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu was one year older than him, and his thoughts were more detailed. He glanced at the people in the hall and saw that everyone in the field was dressed in Qingyunmen. Most people are armed with swords, mostly long swords. Among them, the six people sitting on the chairs are more outstanding and outstanding. There are three common customs among these six people, especially the man sitting in the middle in the dark green robe, crane bone fairy wind, warm and bright eyes, naturally is the famous Qingyun Gate master Dao Xuanzhen.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu was less talkative at the moment, pulled Zhang Xiaofan, ran to the six people, knelt down against Dao Xuanzhen, and knocked on more than once.</p>
<p>Dao Xuanzhen looked at him carefully and sighed slightly, saying, &ldquo;Poor boy, you get up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu didn&rsquo;t get up, looked up at this fairy-class figure, and said sadly: &ldquo;True man, my two are young and ignorant. Suddenly undergoing this great change, I really don&rsquo;t know what to do. Your old man is supernatural and capable. Knowing the past and the future, please make the decision for us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan wouldn&rsquo;t talk as much as he did, and at the moment his mind was in a mess, and he also said: &ldquo;Yes, Grandpa God, you have to be the master!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everyone listened, and couldn&rsquo;t help smiling. Zhang Xiaofan was ignorant, but then everyone&rsquo;s eyes fell on Lin Jingyu&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu was a young man, in a state of great change, and faced with the famous people like Daoxuan Zhenren, he still spoke in a well-organized and organized manner. This calmness is far better than ordinary children, let alone nothing. As far as I know, Zhang Xiaofan, who also regarded Daoxuan as a fairy</p>
<p>The massacre in Caomiao Village is something that Qingyunmen hasn’t seen and heard of for thousands of years. The incident happened at the foot of Qingyunmen, and Qingyunmen sent shocks. After receiving the report, Daoxuan Zhenren was furious and immediately summoned the first of the remaining six veins to discuss. At this moment, except for the first master of Shuiyue, the first pulse of &ldquo;Little Bamboo Peak&rdquo;, the other five pulses are all in the seat.</p>
<p>The person who can serve as the first person in Qingyun Seven Veins is naturally the top person in Qingyun Gate; and the top person in Qingyun Gate is also the most outstanding person in this world. All the people present looked like torches. At this moment, they all said in their hearts: &ldquo;A good piece of jade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Daoxuan Zhenren smiled slightly and said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about this in the future, but you live under the Qingyun Mountain, and I will not ignore the Qingyun Gate. It&rsquo;s just that I have a few questions to ask you and hope you can answer them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu nodded and said: &ldquo;Yes, the disciples know everything. Please ask the real person to talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Daoxuan Zhenren nodded and said, &ldquo;How did you escape this robbery?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu stayed for a while and said, &ldquo;Return to the real person. I remember sleeping in my bed last night, but I woke up in the morning and lay with Xiaofan under a pine tree in the wild. I didn&rsquo;t know what happened. When I was awakened, we ran back to the village together, and when we saw that, that, that scene, we were scared and fainted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dao Xuan Zhenren frowned and looked at Zhang Xiaofan, saying, &ldquo;You wake him up, how about you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan thought for a while and said, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know how to do it and went there. When I woke up and saw Jing Yu beside me, I woke him up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dao Xuan Zhenren and everyone else looked at it for the first time, and there was confusion in their eyes. If an expert rescues, why only save these two children, if not, they can&rsquo;t justify it anyway!</p>
<p>Daoxuan Zhenren pondered for a while, and said, &ldquo;That means, you know nothing about last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two were on the same channel: &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dao Xuanzhen sighed and sighed: Song Daren. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The disciple is here.&rdquo; A Qingyun disciple came out, tall and burly, dressed as a layman. The position he was standing behind was just behind a sitting fat man, who appeared to be his disciple.</p>
<p>Dao Xuanzhen said: &ldquo;It was the first thing you discovered about Caomiao Village, so you can repeat the situation that day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren said loudly, &ldquo;Yes. This morning, the disciple and several brothers from the same discipline returned home and returned to the sky. When passing the sky above Caomiao Village, the disciple bowed his head inadvertently and found that there were more than 200 in the village. The corpses piled up together, and it was terrible to see. The disciples and others hurriedly went down to check. They only found the two children after the village. When they saw that they were unconscious, they first sent a younger brother back. Later they were in the latrine by the village,&rdquo; Uncle Wang Er, who shrank his hand at the corner, said, &ldquo;I found this man. It was just that his eyes were dull and he was in a trance. No matter how his disciples asked, he didn&rsquo;t answer, and he just repeatedly said: ghosts, ghosts, evil spirits. &quot;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu shook her body and said with a tremble: &ldquo;This big brother, have you counted the number?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren had sympathy and said, &ldquo;I found a brother who trades firewood with your village on weekdays. He is very familiar with the situation of the villagers in your village. After he recognized it, we passed the count and Cao Miao Village was forty. There are a total of 247 people in the two households, but all three of you are dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Despite the premonition in my heart, after hearing Song Daren&rsquo;s affirmative words, Lin Jingyu and Zhang Xiaofan couldn&rsquo;t help but the eyes were black and almost fainted again.</p>
<p>Dao Xuanzhen sighed softly, flicking with his left hand, a red bead flew out of his sleeve robe, and flew in front of Zhang and Lin, rolling a few times on their foreheads, and suddenly a cool breath, Into the body. Somehow, the tense nerves in their hearts seemed to be loose, and they felt like they were exhausted. They couldn&rsquo;t help but lay on the hall and slept.</p>
<p>Daoxuan Zhenren waved his hand, and the disciples who were standing saluted one after another, then stepped back out in turn. Within the hall, only six of them remained.</p>
<p>At this time, the chunky man said: &ldquo;Brother Master, you are now using &ldquo;Ding Shenzhu&rdquo; to temporarily stabilize them, but when they wake up, what are you going to do with it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Daoxuan Zhenren pondered for a moment, then turned to the Daoist sitting first on the left, and asked, &ldquo;Sister Cangsong, what do you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cangsong Taoist is tall and solemn, and is the first of the &ldquo;Dragon Head Peak&rdquo; in Qingyunmen. In the Qingyun Gate, in addition to the long door of Daoxuan Zhenren, he was the most powerful with the pulse of his dragon head. Cangsong is severe in nature. In addition to managing his disciples, he also manages the punishment in Qingyunmen. Qingyun&rsquo;s disciples admired Dao Xuanzhen who is the master of the day, but the most feared thing is this unsmiling Cangsong head.</p>
<p>The Congsong Taoist frowned two times, and after a while, he said: &ldquo;There are many doubts in this matter, and I am anxious to find out. But the villagers in Caomiao have always been simple, and we must not ignore their orphans. The two of them will go to the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Daoxuan Zhenren nodded and said, &ldquo;Yes, I mean that too. These two children are in a lonely life, and we have to take care of them. It&rsquo;s just that I haven&rsquo;t accepted students for many years. I don&rsquo;t know which teacher can receive them under the door?&rdquo; &quot;</p>
<p>At this time, the short and stout person, the first field in the vein of Qingyunmen&rsquo;s &ldquo;Dazhufeng&rdquo;, was not easy to say, &ldquo;Brother Master, in my opinion, it is best not to let them both fall under the same door. They are close in life, If you stay together, you will remember the past every time you see the other party.</p>
<p>Dao Xuanzhen thought about it for a while and said, &ldquo;Sister Tian is justified. The two of them are very young. Because of this great change, we should resolve their resentment. It is really not suitable for them to live together. It takes two A younger brother has come to take them in.&rdquo; He said, and looked at the crowd.</p>
<p>I saw the first of the other five veins, headed by Cangsong, Tian Yi and others&rsquo; eyes fell on Lin Jingyu&rsquo;s body almost at the same time, wandering around and refusing to leave, but no one ignored Zhang Xiaofan on the side.</p>
<p>Qualification is extremely important in the way of cultivation. There are often so-called genius enlightenments in the world, which is better than a century of cultivation. The Qingyunmen people have a deep understanding of this. When Qingyunmen was at the end of its desperate journey, only a young and beautiful ancestor who was awe-inspiring. Although young, but talented, he broke through the scrolls of his predecessors, and his practice was far better than that of his ancestors. To make a small green cloud gate full of vitality and prosperity, it is now the leader of the world.</p>
<p>In addition, the famous teacher is hard to find, but the disciples with high qualifications are also rare. Lin Jingyu is highly talented and has a very good root. This is the first one of the Qingyunmen&rsquo;s veins.</p>
<p>After being quiet for a while, Na Tian was not easy to cough and said, &ldquo;Hey, brother, you know that my Dazhufeng has always been thin, so I will solve one for you this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said that he was about to point at Lin Jingyu, but he was preempted by Shang Zhengliang, the first &ldquo;Chaoyang Peak&rdquo; beside him, and stood in front of him. He said to Dao Xuanzhen, &ldquo;Brother Master, today I saw this kid I am very close to him. I think that if I have a long-term relationship with him, then let him join me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Qingyun Gate has a long history, and all the veins on the surface are calm, but inside it means competing with each other. Seeing this Lin Jingyu&rsquo;s superior qualifications, no one can be sure whether it will be the next Green Leaf Patriarch, not to mention the worst income under the door. It’s just multiple disciples, but it won’t give every other vein a chance. Originally Dao Xuan Zhenren&rsquo;s prestige practice, no one dare to argue, but Dao Xuan himself refused to accept, where can such good things be missed?</p>
<p>As soon as the voice of Shang Zhengliang fell, the first Tianyun Taoist of Luoxia Peak said: &ldquo;Brother Shang, there are already two hundred disciples under your door. If all of you have a fate with you, your fate is also inevitable. Too much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shang Zhengliang blushed and was about to speak. Tian Tian was not easy but preemptively said: &ldquo;Brother Tianyun is right. When it comes to the number of disciples, the least you have are more than a hundred. My Dazhufeng has only seven people, too It&rsquo;s not like it. It&rsquo;s better&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this time, the Taoist Cangsong interrupted him and said, &ldquo;Brother Tian, ​​these two children are so pitiful in life. We want to give them the best care, not the number of ourselves.&rdquo; After that, he said Turning his head to Dao Xuanzhen, he said, &ldquo;Senior Master, this child is indeed a good piece of material. Please let me take him under the door. I will teach him carefully and make him a talent to comfort the undead in Caomiao Village. .&rdquo;</p>
<p>Realist Dao Xuan pondered for a while, Tian Yi, Shang Zhengliang and others all secretly murmured, and after a while, Realistic Dao Xuanren really said: &ldquo;Sister Cangsong also makes sense, then let him invest in your Under the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cang Song smiled slightly and said, &ldquo;Thank you, Brother Senior.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the eyes of everyone, they had long been in the same door as Cangsong. They knew that Cangsong was always unsmiling. Today, smiling is extremely joyful, and he can&rsquo;t help being secretly annoyed. Only Daoxuan Zhenren said something, and Cangsong&rsquo;s Dragon Head Peak had a great strength, so he had to swallow this breath.</p>
<p>Daoxuan paused for a while, then said: &ldquo;Then this other&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shang Zhengliang coughed and closed his eyes; Tian Yun looked at the ceiling of the hall and suddenly found that the pattern there was particularly beautiful; Tian An Hey laughed aloud, and suddenly fell asleep, he had to fall asleep; The other line of &ldquo;Fenghuifeng&rdquo;, the first line of &ldquo;Fenghuifeng&rdquo;, whose mouth has been snatched away, is simply settled, and seems to have ignored the matter from the beginning.</p>
<p>Only the triumphant Cangsong Taoist looked at everyone coldly, but all eyes were smiling.</p>
<p>Realistic Dao Xuan can&rsquo;t help but feel a little embarrassed, but what kind of character does he naturally say nothing about this bad qualification? Don&rsquo;t you just don&rsquo;t want it, just a thought, and immediately found a substitute for the dead ghost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brother Tian.&rdquo; Dao Xuanzhen&rsquo;s smile seemed so kind at the moment.</p>
<p>Tian was not easy to jump, immediately jumped up, and was about to speak, but was preempted by the real people of Daoxuan: &ldquo;The matter of Caomiao Village was first discovered by Song Daren, a disciple under your door. Fate. Hey, you got the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian was not in a hurry, Zhang Xiaofan was of average qualification, and he saw it at a glance. It was just a burden to receive the door, and he was naturally unhappy. He was about to distinguish, but how did Daoxuan willingly give him the opportunity to speak and snatch: &ldquo;Okay, this matter comes to an end. Your fellow students should pay attention to investigate this matter, do you understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cangsong and others stood up together and said in unison: &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dao Xuanzhen nodded his head, coughed a few times, and quickly walked into the apse without looking at Tian&rsquo;s difficult appearance. After his figure disappeared in the hall, the Qingyunmen Yuqing Hall suddenly burst into laughter.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Song Daren, a disciple under Dazhufeng’s door, had been waiting outside the door of Yuqing Hall. Finally, he waited for the teachers to come out and greeted him, but when he saw Master Tian holding Zhang Xiaofan in his hands, he couldn’t help but say, “Master, what’s wrong?”</p>
<p>Tian was not easy to see him, and he felt annoyed, and said angrily: &ldquo;What is it? Is it silly? Isn&rsquo;t it quick to pick it up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren quickly took over Zhang Xiaofan, who was still asleep, Tian was not angry, but his eyes were aimed at Shang Zhengliang, Tian Yun and other people who were walking out at the same time, and he laughed at himself, and he was even more annoyed and shouted to Song Daren. : &ldquo;Hurry up, what&rsquo;s going on there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>No matter what else he said, his right hand stroked the void, the red light flashed, and a red long sword was sacrificed by him, and no matter how he moved, he fluttered the sword and broke away.</p>
<p>Song Daren was puzzled for a while, but at least he understood that he had an additional younger brother. He looked at Zhang Xiaofan in his arms and couldn&rsquo;t help saying: &ldquo;Little brother, I don&rsquo;t know your name yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan, however, was awake from sleep, unaware of his own destiny, and turned a big bend unconsciously.</p>
