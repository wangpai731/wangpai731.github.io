      <p>Song Daren froze for a moment, the sound lingered in his ears, just like fairy music. After a while, he woke up like a dream and turned around like lightning, only to see five or six female disciples standing behind him. In the Qingyun Gate, under the door of Xiaozhufeng who always only accepted female disciples.</p>
<p>The first to face them was a beautiful woman with a melon seed face, her hair like clouds, her skin like snow, and a faint smile on the corner of her mouth. Zhang Xiaofan looked at the woman, and wanted to go back and ask her sister who was in the same line. When she looked back, she saw that from Wu Dayi to Zheng Dali to He Dazhi, all of them had strange smiles and thoughts. When I moved, I looked at Song Daren again, but when I saw this savvy and able-bodied master, he looked smirking and dumbfounded. I didn&rsquo;t seem to know what to say. He turned to think about it, and guessed the woman&rsquo;s identity.</p>
<p>Sure enough, He Dazhi and others on the side were waiting to see a good show, but unexpectedly Song Daren suddenly fell into a state of dementia. That kind of dullness was not only unbearable to everyone at Dazhufeng, but even all the female disciples across Xiaozhufeng were laughing. The beautiful woman who stood in front of Song Daren slightly fainted and whispered, &ldquo;Brother Song.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren hadn&rsquo;t responded yet, and the impatient He Dazhi had already said: &ldquo;Haha, Sister Wenmin, you and I haven&rsquo;t seen you for many years now. How are you doing lately?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wen Minmei moved to the lean man and stopped for a moment, then smiled and said, &ldquo;This is Brother He Dazhi and Brother He?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He Dazhi nodded again and again, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s right down there, Master Sister memorable. You and I only met in front of a Jiazi, and I still remember it down, which really surprised me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wen Min smiled slightly and said, &ldquo;Senior Brother He resisted the strong enemy in the last competition and showed his talents. I naturally remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He Dazhi&rsquo;s face was blushing. In the first round of the seven-pulse meeting, he met a master of Changmen Tongtianfeng in the first round of the competition. Although he tried his best, he still defeated, but he was smart. When the next laugh came, he said: &ldquo;Those old things, don&rsquo;t mention it, these little brothers are so shallow that they are far less than those of Sister Wen and our brothers. Speaking of it, since the last big test , Our brothers miss you all the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wen Min&rsquo;s face was reddish, but she didn&rsquo;t answer. She only pointed at Song Daren with the corner of her eyes, but the young teachers and sisters behind her had already laughed. Song Daren, a tyrant man, was embarrassed like a shy teenager at the moment, and quickly responded: &ldquo;No, no, sometimes I&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Before he finished speaking, he was interrupted by a young woman behind Wen Min opposite him. &ldquo;So don&rsquo;t you miss our sister Wen Min?&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a jump in his heart, Song Daren secretly raised his eyes and looked at Wen Min. We saw that Wen Min was also looking at him, and his eyes were not blinking. Anxious in his heart, he blurted out: &ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s not, I miss it&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;what!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dazhufeng and Xiaozhufeng laughed together, especially the young women behind Wen Min, who smiled particularly loudly and loudly, causing other disciples in the neighborhood to look a bit more here.</p>
<p>He Dazhi treated everyone with a little laughter, and said to all the women of Xiaozhufeng: &ldquo;Sisters, in fact, our brothers mean this, he is not missing Sister Wenmin, but he does not always miss&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; Xiaozhufeng a female disciple asked loudly.</p>
<p>He Dazhi glanced at the woman and smiled, &ldquo;He remembered Sister Wen once after a moment, and read her name once again after a moment, so he said that there was no time to miss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everyone laughed, Song Daren stared at He Dazhi fiercely, but looked at Wen Min in the corner of her eyes. She saw a smile in her mouth, but she seemed not angry, and she couldn&rsquo;t help being secretly happy, but she said in her mouth: &ldquo;Sister Wen, they Just kidding, you, don’t care.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wen Min smiled a bit, turned his head to stop the sisters behind him who were laughing and shaking, and then gave him a deep look and said, &ldquo;So what do you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren bit his face bitterly and said &ldquo;I, I, I&rdquo; a few times, but couldn&rsquo;t say anything. Looking at him, the women couldn&rsquo;t help but laughed again. Wen Min shook his head, glared at him, ignored him, walked to Tian Ling&rsquo;er, took her white jade palm, looked at her carefully, and said, &ldquo;Are you Lingling&rsquo;s sister?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Ling&rsquo;er wondered: &ldquo;Yes. Sister Wen, how could you know me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wen Min said with a smile: &ldquo;You often visit Master on our Xiaozhu Peak with Uncle Su Rusu. We have known you for a long time. I haven&rsquo;t seen you in a few years, and I really look more handsome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Ling&rsquo;er took Wen Min&rsquo;s hand and smiled, &ldquo;Where, how can I compare with the flowery appearance of Sister Min above?&rdquo; At this point, she lowered her voice and leaned in front to whisper: &ldquo;My brother can do Sister Wen, you’re upset.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wen Min glanced at Song Daren, and Song Daren immediately showed a smirk. She shook her head and whispered: &ldquo;Your brother, you really are an elm head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Linger laughed out loudly, and immediately felt that it was too late to meet this sister Wenmin. When Xi Minmin gently pulled, Tian Linger followed her to the middle of the group of women in Xiaozhufeng, chatting a few words. He immediately became very familiar, laughed and laughed, and from time to time came out from among the group of women, but left Song Daren and others aside.</p>
<p>Song Daren stood aside and wanted to step forward to speak with Wen Min, but he didn&rsquo;t know how to speak for a moment, so he had to stand on the spot. Not talking about others, Zhang Xiaofan looked at him and shook his head.</p>
<p>At this moment, Zhang Xiaofan suddenly heard Du Bishu beside him, &ldquo;Eh&rdquo;, said: &ldquo;A lot of people have come again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan felt strange in his heart, and suddenly looked shocked. I saw a group of people walking in the distance, a total of more than 30 people, all dressed in white, full of vigor, in other words, they were all high-spirited. But the first few people are extraordinary, especially the first one, white clothes like snow, handsome and elegant, not who is that Qi Hao?</p>
<p>Qi Hao!</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan stared at the group of people who came over and repeated the name in his heart. He also heard the four brothers beside him suddenly smile, and whispered: &ldquo;Longshoufeng&rsquo;s veins are really many people. &quot;</p>
<p>Qi Hao also saw everyone at Dazhufeng at this time, and immediately came over, and everyone behind him also followed. As he approached, he smiled at Song Daren: &ldquo;Brother Song, you and I met again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren did not dare to neglect, and said back: &ldquo;Brother Qi, you are also here. I don&rsquo;t know if you can participate in this big test?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Qi Hao said with a smile: &ldquo;The original younger brother did not want to participate, but the teacher thought that the younger brother still needs to practice, and ordered me to participate, so he took up a place in the main vein.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren nodded and said with a smile: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so good, with Brother Qi&rsquo;s talents, you won&rsquo;t be the winner this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Qi Hao shook his head again and again and said modestly: &ldquo;Where and where, Brother Song is too rewarding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two of them were talking on the facade, but Zhang Xiaofan searched behind Qi Hao with his eyes widened. Sure enough, within a moment, he saw Lin Jingyu standing behind Qi Hao also swept his eyes, apparently also What are you looking for. The two of them touched each other&rsquo;s eyes with great joy, and came out at the same time, holding each other&rsquo;s hand as if they had a thousand words, but they could not speak for a while.</p>
<p>For a long time, Lin Jingyu said: &ldquo;Xiaofan, did you participate in this big test?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan nodded and smiled, &ldquo;Yes, my Master treats me very well, and Kai En let me participate, how about you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu said: &ldquo;I also participated, hum, what good is your dwarf master, I went to you two years ago, he treated you like that&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan quickly said: &ldquo;No, he is not like that on weekdays, he was just angry that day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu and his friends from this time have a rare reunion, unwilling to let these boring topics disturb their moods. When the conversation went off, he smiled and said, &ldquo;You guys haven&rsquo;t seen each other for two years, but they have grown so high?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan gave him a punch and smiled and scolded: &ldquo;Why, you can grow up, don&rsquo;t you allow me to be tall?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu laughed. The two of them talked on their own, and this time there was no teacher next to them, they talked happily, and others ignored them. It was only during the conversation that Zhang Xiaofan looked back inadvertently, but saw that Qi Hao saw Tian Ling&rsquo;er and Wen Min&rsquo;s group of women standing aside and was walking over to say hello. His heartache was unprovoked, and his face also changed. .</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu looked in his eyes and was surprised: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong, Xiaofan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan shook his head and said with a strong smile: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay.&rdquo; But despite his words, his eyes still looked at Qi Hao&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>Qi Hao had already come to Tian Ling&rsquo;er and Wen Min at this time. He smiled and said to Tian Ling&rsquo;er first, saying, &ldquo;Sister Tian, ​​do you remember me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Ling&rsquo;er has been happily talking with everyone such as Wenmin and Xiaozhufeng. At this time, Qi Hao suddenly appeared, somehow, his face was red, and his voice also became quieter: &ldquo;Yes, Brother Qi.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From a distance, Tian Ling&rsquo;er&rsquo;s clear face was slightly reddish, and her watery eyes were at first glance like dreams, but this beautiful face reflected in Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s eyes in the distance. Generally, the pain is deep in my heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Xiaofan, what&rsquo;s wrong with you, why did your face suddenly become so white?&rdquo; Lin Jingyu didn&rsquo;t know, so she cared seriously: &ldquo;Are you sick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s okay, I&rsquo;m fine.&rdquo; Zhang Xiaofan said lowly.</p>
<p>In the distance, Wen Min was so keen on thinking how he looked at Tian Ling&rsquo;er, and his heart was roughly counted. Now he said to Qi Hao: &ldquo;Brother Qi, why don&rsquo;t you only recognize Sister Tian, ​​we don&rsquo;t have our sisters in Xiaozhufeng in your eyes?&rdquo; &quot;</p>
<p>After she said this, the women behind her all rallied, and Qi Hao quickly said, &ldquo;Where is Sister Wen, how dare I neglect Sister Zhuzhu so much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wen Min chuckled and said, &ldquo;Brother Qi will participate in the Qimai Wushu again this time. Presumably, I will get it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Qi Hao&rsquo;s eyes flashed with precision, saying: &ldquo;Sister Wen has passed three barriers in the last big test, but unfortunately it was defeated by the elder Xiao Xiaocai, the elder brother Xiao Xiao. Master Shuiyue&rsquo;s careful cultivation, now as the first master of Xiaozhufeng, must also come to the laurel of this big test.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wen Min smiled and said, &ldquo;Dare not dare, how dare I fight with Brother Qi, and I can&rsquo;t afford the title of Xiaozhufeng&rsquo;s first master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Qi Hao frowned: &ldquo;Sister Wen, you are so polite&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wen Min said with a smile: &ldquo;Fei Ye, Master Master Shuiyue is a man of heaven and earth. My qualifications are dull. I can&rsquo;t get a true story from her old man. There are other wizards and sisters in this line. Brother Qi should be careful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Qi Hao&rsquo;s eyes were brilliant, but he smiled on his face: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so much better, it must be a genius who is willing to worship the wind, and it must also be a wizard who is not born. The younger brother really wants to see it soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wen Min chuckled, nodded, and said no more, pulling Tian Ling&rsquo;er, who was not too willing to walk, to the side.</p>
<p>At this moment, there was a scream suddenly over the square, thunderous and shaking the audience. Hundreds of Qingyun disciples on the square looked up and saw a red light shot, and stopped a moment above the square, a red fairy sword exuded Dao Xianqi, across the air in the square, standing above a long gate of Tongtianfeng Taoist, he said to the disciples standing on the square:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brothers, the real person in charge has orders with you first, please speak to the Yuqing Hall of the brothers who participated in the Qimai Wuwu test.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mountain breeze blew, and the white clouds were misty. The Qingyun disciples of the hundreds of people in the square commotioned for a while, and then some people came out one after another and walked toward the front of the square.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan thought that the disciples who cultivated to the depths would sacrifice the magic weapon to the sky, but when they looked at the crowd, they seemed to have no intention and walked one by one honestly. He walked with Lin Jingyu and looked to the left and right. He saw Tian Ling&rsquo;er and Xiaozhufeng Wenmin and other women walking together with a smile on his face, and he seemed to be in a good mood. Song Daren and other Dazhufeng disciples followed them.</p>
<p>As for Longshoufeng&rsquo;s veins, seven or eight of them came out of the group of people in Qi Hao, but at this moment they went elsewhere and greeted other disciples who also came out, especially Qi Hao, who was familiar with I shouted the names of other disciples and greeted each other, and all the disciples met with smiles, and they seemed to have a wide range of friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brother Qi, he is very good at making friends,&rdquo; noticed that Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s eyes were always on Qi Hao, Lin Jingyu walking beside him, &ldquo;And he is a deep man, and he is respected by the master. He is very trustworthy, so everyone in the Qingyun Gate gives him a face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan heard nothing in his ears, but nodded slowly.</p>
<p>At the end of the square, there was the &ldquo;Hongqiao&rdquo; in the six sceneries of Qingyun. Zhang Xiaofan and Lin Jingyu walked here when they were rescued on Qingyun Mountain five years ago. They revisited the place at this moment and couldn&rsquo;t help feeling.</p>
<p>Stepping on the magical bridge body of Hongqiao and watching the clear water flowing down the sides of the bridge, it still reflects the psychedelic and beautiful colorful rainbow. Five years ago, the two boys who did not know anything about the world are now disciples under the gate of Qingyun. Walking at the end of the crowd, Lin Jingyu suddenly sighed lowly: &ldquo;Five years!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan said nothing in silence, but walked forward. The scenery in front of me was the same as that of the past. With the rise of Hongqiao, the white clouds gradually fell under my feet, and the blue sky was clear and clean, and it was overhead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you go up to the sword?&rdquo; Zhang Xiaofan said suddenly.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu was slightly surprised, and said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know that our disciples&rsquo; generations are not allowed to pass by Yujian near the main hall of Tongtianfeng. I heard from Brother Qi Hao that this is for Show respect for the long gate and walk up in the holy place of Yuqingguan; Secondly, I heard that at the beginning of our Qingyunmen school, Qingyun Patriarch had set up a very strong prohibition on the top of Tongtian Peak in order to protect this place, named ' &ldquo;Zhu Xian Jian Zhen&rdquo;, as long as anyone unauthorized fly to the sky above Tongtian Peak, they must be killed by &ldquo;Zhu Xian Jian Zhen&rdquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was taken aback, and said: &ldquo;No wonder there are so many masters in the same class, there is not even a sword. By the way, is that &ldquo;Zhu Xian Jian Zhen&rdquo; powerful?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu glanced at the mountain towering high in front, saying, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen it yet, but I think it&rsquo;s extremely powerful. I heard that the &ldquo;Zhu Xian Jian Zhen&rdquo; was passed down from Qingyun Patriarch, and to Qingyun Patriarch a thousand years ago It will be perfected again, with great power. Since then, I have never heard of anyone who dares to come to our Qingyun Mountain to spread wilderness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan followed his gaze to the majestic tall mountain and sighed, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s amazing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two of them walked as they said, and followed the dozens of people across Hongqiao. Along the way, Zhang Xiaofan looked at these younger generations of Qingyunmen, but seeing more than 60 people, men accounted for the majority, and female disciples estimated that there were only 13 or 4 people, and most of them were wearing Xiaozhufeng costumes. of. However, regardless of whether they are men or women, in the eyes, almost all of them are magnificent, men are magnificent, women are beautiful and generous, handsome men and beauties are everywhere. Anyone who has read it will have to say that Qingyunmen has a successor and a bright future.</p>
<p>After crossing the Hongqiao, you will arrive at the Bishuitan where the mountain spirit beast &ldquo;Water Unicorn&rdquo; in Qingyunmen Town lives. Different from when Zhang Xiaofan and Lin Jingyu first came five years ago, this ancient beast, known as &ldquo;Spirit Venerable&rdquo; by Qingyunmen disciples, did not hide in the pool water at this time, but had been lying on the edge of the pool for a long time. The sun is shining on the ground. But looking at its lazy look, it is no different from five years ago.</p>
<p>Qingyun disciple walked down the Hongqiao, saluted the behemoth one by one, and then stepped on the steps by the lake, and walked toward the main hall of the Yuqing Temple high above. Lin Jingyu and Zhang Xiaofan followed the crowd and whispered to Zhang Xiaofan: &ldquo;Do you remember what happened when we first came?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan nodded and said with a lingering fear: &ldquo;Remember, I was drenched in water, but that&rsquo;s enough, seeing such a big monster scared me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu smiled a little at the corner of his mouth and said, &ldquo;That is, when we had seen this kind of thing before when we were in Caomiao Village, I thought that the biggest animal in the world is the bear on Qingyun Mountain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan laughed aloud, and everyone looked back for a while, Zhang Xiaofan was startled and quickly stopped the laughter. Lin Jingyu was also taken aback, coughing twice, and his face was red.</p>
<p>Others glanced a few times, then turned their heads and continued to walk, Zhang Xiaofan was relieved, and then looked at Lin Jingyu, their eyes met, and they all smiled.</p>
<p>The first dozens of people quickly walked past. Zhang Xiaofan and Lin Jingyu walked down the Hongqiao and came to the Bishuitan, respectfully paid a respect to the water unicorn. However, from the beginning, this water unicorn seemed to have slept particularly dead, and no one responded to the salute. At this moment, he buried his head and slept, snoring sounded like thunder. Ten out of ten did not know that these two Qingyun juniors were saluting to it.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan and Lin Jingyu did not think that Shui Qilin would answer them. After saluting, they walked up the stairs. Zhang Xiaofan said: &ldquo;Jing Yu, the last time you came to Dazhufeng, in a hurry, I did not congratulate you. I didn&rsquo;t expect you to have such a high morality just a few years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu smiled and said, &ldquo;This is my mentor, Cangsong Real, and all of my brothers, and he taught me carefully.&rdquo; At this point, his voice stopped, and his voice gradually became low, saying: &ldquo;In fact, in the first few years, I When I worked hard, I thought of the bloody corpses in the village of Caomiao, and I felt uncomfortable, so I worked hard to practice, hoping that one day I would have a grudge against my parents and the people in the village.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan felt sour and stretched out his hand and patted him on the shoulder. Lin Jingyu settled his mind, packed his mood, and smiled: &ldquo;Okay, let&rsquo;s not talk about the previous things. What about you, how are you practicing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan shook his head and said, &ldquo;You know that I haven&rsquo;t been as smart as you since I was a child. Over the years at Master Dazhu, Master and all of my brothers are very kind to me, but I&rsquo;m too stupid, and I&rsquo;m very slow in my cultivation. I&rsquo;m sorry Master. With your brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu snorted and said, &ldquo;Where are you stupid, I think Bacheng is your dwarf master who is deliberately embarrassed for you, and does not pass on your true Qingyun Gate cultivation method.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan didn&rsquo;t expect the dispute two years ago. Lin Jingyu still doesn&rsquo;t care about Tian now, and now laughs: &ldquo;No, my master is not that kind of person. Forget it, don&rsquo;t talk about me, right , Is your magic weapon the same as the &ldquo;Dragon Sword&rdquo; two years ago?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu nodded and smiled, &ldquo;This Excalibur is the treasure of the Dragon&rsquo;s Peak. The Master has loved to pass on this sword. In addition to its great power and the sword&rsquo;s spirituality, it is very helpful to my cultivation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was envious in his heart, and his face also appeared, saying: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu smiled and asked, &ldquo;What about you, Xiaofan, do you have any magic weapon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan froze for a moment, and subconsciously reached into his arms to touch the black &ldquo;burning stick&rdquo;. A trace of coldness rushed into his palm arbitrarily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t practiced enough, and I can&rsquo;t drive away the magic treasure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu didn&rsquo;t care either. It seemed to have been expected to comfort him: &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter, Xiaofan, as long as you practice diligently, you will succeed. Anyway, we are still young, so we should come and see this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s mouth moved a bit, looking at the old friend&rsquo;s kind face, listening to his gentle words, but there was no hint of comfort.</p>
<p>Have a look?</p>
<p>Everyone thought that he came here just to see. When he thought of this, there was a sudden burst of anger in his heart, like a fire burning in the heart, but it disappeared in a blink of an eye. He lowered his head, didn&rsquo;t speak, and didn&rsquo;t even blame his friends, because he found that he thought so.</p>
<p>As if responding to his thoughts, the &ldquo;burning stick&rdquo; still in contact with his palm in his arms at the moment suddenly reacted, and for a moment, the cold shone, spreading directly from his palm to his shoulder.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was taken aback, but then discovered that this feeling did not harm him at all, but was rather comfortable. He looked sideways, but saw Lin Jingyu unaware.</p>
<p>Just when Zhang Xiaofan was relieved, suddenly, a deafening roar erupted from behind them. Zhang Xiaofan was okay, but even Lin Jingyu, who was far better than him in practice, was like him. His whole body was shocked, his ears rang loudly, and his tinnitus continued. The part of the Qingyunmen disciples walking in front of them seemed to be the same. The same situation.</p>
<p>Everyone was so surprised, how could there be such a strange noise above this holy ground of Qingyun Gate, and now they turned back one by one, and at a glance, everyone was even more shocked and inexplicable.</p>
