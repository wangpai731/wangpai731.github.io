      <p>Zhang Xiaofan looked at the bead for a long while, and his breathing gradually calmed down, but apart from seeing the difference in color brightness, the others did not see anything, and had to put it back on his chest again. He looked at Tian Ling&rsquo;er next to him and saw that she was still unconscious, but her face was getting bloodied, and the situation was much better.</p>
<p>He picked up the amber Zhu Ling and took a closer look. This was the first time he looked at this treasure so close, but he felt his tentacles were soft and very comfortable, recalling the beauty of Tian Ling&rsquo;er&rsquo;s imperial walk just now His posture envyed me for a while.</p>
<p>He looked at it for a while, and his hands were like Tian Linger&rsquo;s painting, and he called out: &ldquo;Get up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amber and Zhu Ling are like dead snakes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sergey&rdquo;, but the gray monkey&rsquo;s hand on the side covered his belly, fell to the ground, and laughed.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan glared at it, but he shared the trouble with the monkey just now, and realized that he was a little friendly, and all the previous hostility had vanished. He made a grimace at the monkey&rsquo;s tongue and ignored it. He put Amber Zhu Ling next to Tian Ling&rsquo;er, and his eyes looked at the water hole in the open space.</p>
<p>It was a small water pond with a small range and no source. It was estimated that it was formed by underground spring water. The water in the water pond is green, and the depth is not clear from here. There is a gap on the west side of the water pond. The water flows from there and merges into a stream, winding away.</p>
<p>In the middle of the pool, there is a pile of rocks, varying sizes and shapes, showing a small part on the water. Among the rocks, a short black rod was inserted diagonally, one foot above the surface of the water, and the rest was submerged in the water. The whole body was black, and no material was seen, which was very ugly.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan didn&rsquo;t take it seriously. He just thought it was strange and abnormal, and it was better to leave early, but Tian Ling&rsquo;er beside him calmed down, but he was still comatose and could not wake up. In contrast, the gray monkey was very spirited, scratching his ears, scratching his itch, catching lice, and couldn&rsquo;t calm down for a moment. Sometimes he also jumped into the woods. I picked some wild fruits from some place and lost two. Give it to Zhang Xiaofan, and then sit down on the ground, eating it with relish.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan took the wild fruit and took a bite, but felt that the entrance was sweet and juicy, and could not help but appetite. He went up the mountain in the early morning and chased all the way. It was almost noon until now. The dripping had not entered and he was already hungry. I ate one of the three bites and wanted to pick up the second one, and suddenly shook my head again, and gently placed it beside Tian Ling&rsquo;er.</p>
<p>Ye Xiaoxia felt less hungry in Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s belly, and his spirit was much better. He stood up, stretched his waist, and looked around, but when he saw Gu Musen, Xiao Xiong, the scenery was quite beautiful. Who knew there would be such a queer.</p>
<p>At this moment, Zhang Xiaofan suddenly realized that his chest was hot, and for a moment he only heard a few clicks of &ldquo;Kaka Kaka&rdquo;, as if something was cracking. He was taken aback and quickly pulled out the bead from his chest. He was shocked. The whole bead was full of green light, and the green inside was like a wolf, desperately hitting the bead wall, and the word &ldquo;*&rdquo; that prevented it from becoming more and more fragile. It is getting darker and duller, and it will be irresistible.</p>
<p>Where does Zhang Xiaofan know that these seemingly ordinary beads are actually the most fierce thing in the world-&ldquo;Blood Beads&rdquo;. The origin of this bead is unknown, but it has bizarre characteristics. If there is a living creature close to it, if the living creature is close to it, it will be eroded by the &ldquo;blood bite&rdquo; and the blood will die, leaving only a skin sac. It is really The terrible evil. Thousands of years ago, this bead was obtained by the elder blackheart of the demon cult. Because of its ***. blood eclipse ability, it was turned into a magic weapon. It was invincible for a time. I don’t know how many righteous people were killed. Later became one of the Four Treasures of the Demons After the old Blackheart died, the bead disappeared and disappeared.</p>
<p>Tianyin Temple&rsquo;s wise god monk had a chance coincidence. He discovered this fierce bead in the Western Everglades thirty years ago. At that time, within a ten-mile radius, the bones were full of bones and there were no living creatures. The wise and compassionate heart moved a lot, and then put it away with the Buddha&rsquo;s Dafa. Then every night, it was applied to the Buddha&rsquo;s magical method to deter the evil force. It has been uninterrupted for thirty years. &ldquo;Parallel hanging in parallel, resisting the blood-eating evil thought with its pure air, and finally pressed down this fierce spirit, tightly bound in the beads, and there was no sky under the layers of Buddha power.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, during the first battle in Caomiao Village, Pu Zhi was hit hard by the mysterious man in black. He was almost exhausted. Although the man in black was also injured and escaped, Pu Zhi knew that he hadn&rsquo;t hurt him at all, and expected him &ldquo;Bead&rdquo; is determined to win, he can only prolong the life of three days after taking the &ldquo;Three Days to Die Pill&rdquo;. At the first thought, he was in danger, handing this blood bead to Zhang Xiaofan, and told him not to show it to others. Leaving the cliff of the deep valley empty, it may hurt some innocent creatures, but it is much better than falling into the hands of the demon.</p>
<p>It was just that Pu Zhi didn&rsquo;t expect that Zhang Xiaofan remembered his kindness, and actually left this big evil thing in memory. This &ldquo;Blood Bead&rdquo; lost the suppression of Buddhism by Buddhism, and there was no pure air of jade rosary beads to resist, the fierce spirit began to gradually erode the ban. But is it true that Tianyin Temple&rsquo;s demon-reducing Dafa is idle, even though the heavy forbidden system has lost its owner, it has always been loyal to its duty and shocked this fierce spirit for three years. It&rsquo;s just that the time is long, after all, it can&rsquo;t resist, and gradually unable to help, then today, it will be broken out of the ban by the blood-swallowing bead.</p>
<p>Although Zhang Xiaofan didn&rsquo;t know about these many twists and turns, he felt faint in his heart. In that year&rsquo;s Battle of the Cao Temple, the &ldquo;*&rdquo; mantra appeared many times during the fight between Pu Zhi and the man in black. Although he was young, he remembered it deeply. At this moment, seeing the truth on the bead is becoming more and more critical, anxious in my heart, and cruel, grasping the bead with his palm, and transporting his little bit of &ldquo;big Brahma Prajna&rdquo; into the bead.</p>
<p>The two are originally homologous, and the &ldquo;*&rdquo; word on the blood-sucking bead actually shines a lot, but before Zhang Xiaofan smiles, it dims in an instant, and at the same time a cold air invades him. In the body, Zhang Xiaofan was half numb for a moment.</p>
<p>The gray monkey next to him suddenly saw Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s face showing pain, and his face was green, and he squeaked twice, anxiously. But Zhang Xiaofan couldn&rsquo;t take care of much, only felt that the whole body&rsquo;s blood was flowing backwards, and all flowed towards the strange bead in his right hand. And the big Brahma in his body was violent at the touch, and he was not the opponent of the cold air at all. At this time, his body had meridian cramps and severe pain, and the pain was unbearable.</p>
<p>He couldn&rsquo;t bear it anymore, staggering a few steps back, and suddenly his body was shaking again, a familiar feeling of nausea returned, rushing to the five internal organs, but he accidentally strayed into the open space again At this moment, just now, there was no more heating to resist.</p>
<p>The gray monkey was in a hurry, &ldquo;Squeak&rdquo; kept calling, but he dared not step into the open space anyway.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s death was overwhelmed and overwhelmed, but he felt cold and hot in his body, such as ants gnawing and nausea, but he was sick, but it was really better than death. His consciousness gradually became blurred, and he stumbled forward, but he didn&rsquo;t know that he had gone in the wrong direction, only to feel that his strength gradually disappeared.</p>
<p>His whole body was shaking, his hands and feet were weak, his feet were soft, and he was paralyzed. At this time, he had reached the edge of the water pool. He exhausted his last distraction, transported the Tai Chi Xuan Qing Dao, and reluctantly attracted some heaven and earth spirits into the body. When he reached the body, he turned into a Brahma-like Prajna. After that, it has turned into nothingness, and Zhang Xiaofan can&rsquo;t take care of so much at this time. It was just that the cold air was too powerful and had a strange feeling of nausea, almost turning his internal organs over and heading straight to his head. In front of him, Venus flickered, his breathing was disordered, and suddenly a sweet throat, a wow, a big gulp of blood spewed out, and he fainted.</p>
<p>At this moment, I only heard a muffled sound, and in an instant, it seemed that the sky was dark, the blue light on the blood-sucking beads was blooming, the whole beads were blue, and a faint golden light flashed, and the &ldquo;*&rdquo; word of the Buddha door was truly Completely shattered, Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s whole body immediately shrouded in blue gas, like a bloodthirsty demon, reborn again.</p>
<p>However, the weird thing was still unfinished. Almost as soon as the green air was free, a loud noise rang from the middle of the water pond, and suddenly the wind and the clouds rushed. The gravel in the pond blasted out and banged. The turquoise waters of the Bilutan pool rushed around the center and became a big vortex. And in the spin vortex, the gap between the splashes of water slowly grew into something, and the black gas was steaming. It was the short black rod, two feet long, non-gold and non-iron, and a fierce qi, came to the face.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan shouted and fell backwards. The blood-sucking bead seemed to stick to his palm and could not be shed. Among them, there was a faint blood color slowly poured into the beads from Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p>A whistling sound, in the sound of the water wave, the short black rod suddenly shot out, rushing towards the blue blood-staining blood-eating bead, a moment later a loud noise, the two fierce things collided together, Zhang Xiaofanru Suddenly, the whole person was shaken up a foot by a huge earthquake. In the open space below him, he was hit by a force.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan fell back to the ground, the Qiqiao bleeding, dizzy, but the pain in his body seemed to be a little lighter. He only felt that there was blood in front of his eyes, but his eyes were bleeding, and he wiped his eyes with his hands. He saw the strange black rod hit the blood-stained beads, and the black gas was endless, attacking forward. The blood bite seems to be spiritual, knowing it is the enemy, and recovering the green energy to resist with all its strength, and the two sides can&rsquo;t hold each other. The cold air and nausea in Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s body gradually receded.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan gasped for breath and was shocked. He unconsciously shook his hand, but the two strange things were like a part of his palm. They could not get rid of it. The black gas was blue and the battle was still endless.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was afraid in his heart. He just wanted to stay away from these two strange things as far as possible. He climbed up with all his strength. Without taking a step, he only felt dizzy in his head, the whole person was shaking, and his feet were weak and weak. His body crooked and fell to the ground. In front of him, the blue pearl and black stick were intertwined, and the fight was very happy, but the black gas was transpiring, and it seemed that it had the upper hand.</p>
<p>After only a moment, I really saw the black gas invade, and the blue light was retreating, seemingly unable to resist. At this moment, Zhang Xiaofan suddenly felt a sharp pain in his palm. At first glance, his heart almost jumped out of his mouth. But in the palm of his hand, in the circle around the blood-stained beads, Yin Hong&rsquo;s blood actually leaked out of the skin, endlessly, and gradually merged into a big blood drop.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan trembled all over his body, and his face lost blood. Correspondingly, the blood-sucking beads were bathed in blood drops, and the blue light suddenly flourished and counterattacked. Not only did he pull the situation back, but he gradually overwhelmed the black gas.</p>
<p>With more and more blood oozing from his hands, Zhang Xiaofan gradually lost consciousness. The bright red blood poured up, and gradually flowed to the interface of the black black rod and the blood bite, and no longer flowed, letting the blue and black gas pumps stop, after a while, it infiltrated here, and gradually The part where the top of the stick touches the beads slowly becomes red.</p>
<p>A faint bloody smell fluttered in the air.</p>
<p>With the passage of time, the red became deeper and deeper, and later it was almost bright and dripping. Somehow, the blue and black gas of the original struggle was dimmed. From the original appearance of repelling the battle, it gradually became a fusion. Trend.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how long it took. This strange change finally came to an end. The black sticks and green beads completely lost their brilliance and merged with each other. With a click, they fell from the hands of Zhang Xiaofan in a coma and fell to the ground.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>&ldquo;Xiaofan! Xiaofan! Young Master!&hellip;&rdquo; A stack of anxious calls echoed in Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s ear.</p>
<p>There was a confusion in his brain, and he felt the pain in his head was so high that it seemed that he had exhausted all his energy even when he opened his eyes. Tian Ling&rsquo;er anxiously brought a trace of flustered face, as if it was near, and slowly became clear in front of his eyes. He moved his lips and whispered, &ldquo;Sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Ling&rsquo;er was overjoyed and said, &ldquo;Xiaofan, are you awake?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofanqiang smiled and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine, Sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Ling&rsquo;er helped him to sit up, Zhang Xiaofan looked at his palm at first glance, but he saw that the skin on the palm of his right hand was not damaged, except for a little pale. He stayed for a while, but he clearly remembered that there was a large amount of blood in his palm just now. Why didn&rsquo;t he even have a trace?</p>
<p>Is it a nightmare?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Xiaofan.&rdquo; Tian Ling&rsquo;er was stunned when he saw him sit up, and looked like he was not at home. He was worried, and pushed him a little.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan woke up and was about to say to her the strange thing just now, but she didn&rsquo;t know where to start for a while, and she thought it was too weird in her heart, but she was also surprised and stunned, and finally said: &ldquo;No, nothing, sister. &quot;</p>
<p>Tian Ling&rsquo;er felt relieved. When she woke up, she saw that it was too late. She was lying under a large pine tree, but the younger brother fell on the open space in the distance, not awake. Frightened in her heart, she hurried to Zhang Xiaofan and awakened him after a while.</p>
<p>At this time Tian Ling&rsquo;er looked around and said to Zhang Xiaofan: &ldquo;Brother, it seems weird here. Let&rsquo;s leave here as soon as possible. I&rsquo;ll ask Niang to come and see it tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan nodded and was about to climb up. Suddenly his body was sore and dizzy. If it weren&rsquo;t for Tian Ling&rsquo;er&rsquo;s hand, he would almost fall again.</p>
<p>Tian Ling&rsquo;er saw that his face was so pale that he couldn&rsquo;t even see a trace of blood, and he was really worried. At the moment, he lifted him carefully. Zhang Xiaofan calmed down and looked at him again. There was no wound, and he said: &ldquo;Sister, I’m just a little dizzy, nothing serious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Ling&rsquo;er took a closer look. It was indeed the case. He nodded and said, &ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s go back faster. It&rsquo;s getting dark. I&rsquo;m afraid that my father and my mother, as well as my fellow brethren, are all worried.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan said: &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Ling&rsquo;er took a deep breath and checked all around him for nothing abnormal, whispering in his heart why he fainted for no reason. Following the gesture, the red light flashed, and &ldquo;Amber Zhu Ling&rdquo; whistled and burst out.</p>
<p>Tian Ling&rsquo;er took Zhang Xiaofan just to go up, and suddenly heard the sound of &ldquo;squeak&rdquo; ringing on the side. The two turned around and looked, but it was the gray-haired monkey who didn&rsquo;t know when to stand next to him, smiling at them, dragging his hand. Wearing a black stick that grows two feet long, I don&rsquo;t know what material it is.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>In front of Dazhufeng Shoujingtang, Tian is not easy to pace back and forth, his brows are wrinkled, and his face is slightly anxious. Early this morning, her daughter and the seven apprentices who were not able to make a weapon went to Houshan to cut bamboo and play. Su Ru went out to look for it early in the morning, and now his disciples have been sent by him one after another, but there are no traces on Dazhu Peak, and there are ups and downs in the mountains, and the jungle is dense. Finding two people is like finding a needle in a haystack.</p>
<p>He was anxious, and suddenly the sound of breaking in the air came, Tian was not easy to look up, but Su Ru came back with two imps. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if they look like Tian Ling&rsquo;er. They actually have a gray-haired monkey lying on Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s shoulder, and they don&rsquo;t know where they came from.</p>
<p>Tian was not easy to let go of this, but his face was not angry. Zhang Xiaofan glanced at Master with two eyes, hair in his heart, he didn’t dare to move, and lowered his head to his chest, but the gray monkey was very naughty. He stretched his hand to Zhang Xiaofan’s hair for a while, and seemed to want to find a few from there. Only lice come.</p>
<p>Tian Ling&rsquo;er put away the amber Zhu Ling, Yu Guang saw his father standing in front of the hall with anger on his face, his eyes rolled a few times, the smile was like a flower, the innocence was so cute, he jumped up and down to Tian Tian&rsquo;s side, pulling his Karate: &ldquo;Dad, we are back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Anhou snorted and said, &ldquo;Where did you go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Ling&rsquo;er smiled and said: &ldquo;Xiao Fan was bullied by a monkey when he was chopping bamboo. I went to catch it to help Xiao Fan get angry, myself, that&rsquo;s the monkey.&rdquo; Then, he pointed Zhang Xiaofan in his hand.</p>
<p>The gray monkey on Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s shoulder was startled. He squeaked two times and made an anger. Then he scratched his head and turned his attention to Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s hair.</p>
<p>Tian Ling&rsquo;er made a grimace at it, and then said about chasing all the way, and then said: &ldquo;&hellip; Later, after chasing into the middle of the valley, I suddenly felt nauseous and fainted somehow. When I woke up, I saw Xiao Fan also He fell to the ground and was unconscious. But fortunately, we were not injured. When we were about to come back, I saw that monkey seemed to be attached to Xiaofan, so I brought it back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian didn&rsquo;t frown, turned to his wife, and said, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru shook his head and said, &ldquo;When I found the two of them in Houshan, I went down to check them, and there was nothing unusual. I think most of them were not enough for Linger&rsquo;s practice, and I was forced to take Xiaofan with them on amber Zhu Aya runs away from the air, and finally gets rid of her strength.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Ling&rsquo;er coquettishly said: &ldquo;Mother, what are you talking about, where will I not practice enough. Xiaofan, do you say that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan quickly said: &ldquo;Yes, yes, yes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Yifan gave Zhang Xiaofan a cold look and said coldly: &ldquo;As a disciple of Qingyun Gate, I was bullied by a monkey. When I spread it, my face will be lost to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan blushed, bowing his head in a dare.</p>
<p>Su Ru walked over and took Tian Ling&rsquo;s hand and said softly, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t eaten for a day, are you hungry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Ling&rsquo;er put out his tongue and smiled, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so hungry, mother!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru glared at her and dragged her towards the kitchen, saying in his mouth: &ldquo;Human devil is big!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan felt hungry in the belly at the moment, but dare not move in front of Tian Yi, listening to Su Ru and Tian Ling&rsquo;er going far away, but the master stopped moving and looked up secretly, but he was empty before the church. It is not easy for Tian to know when he is gone. It is estimated that in his heart, he also scolded this idiot apprentice and thought it was a waste of energy.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was at a loss for a long time and stayed for a long time, only to thunder in his belly, and then turned around, but subconsciously did not want to go to the kitchen, but walked to his room.</p>
<p>Go back to the room and close the door. The gray monkey looks left and right on his shoulder and squeaks. He seems to know that when he gets home, he jumps from his shoulder and jumps to the bed in three steps. It&rsquo;s a joy to shake the pillow.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan looked at the gray monkey and smiled at the corner of his mouth, but was immediately pressed by his hunger. He sat down at the table and poured a cup of cold water from the teapot that had been cold overnight, and drank it.</p>
<p>There was a coolness, straight through my heart.</p>
<p>He sat for a while, reaching for a thing from his arms, which was the ugly short stick. At the moment, the bead that Pu Zhi gave him was tightly connected with the unknown short rod, and even the color changed to black, black, and a dark red at the interface, as if solidified The blood stains are not only ugly, but also a little disgusting.</p>
<p>He looked at it for a long while, and suddenly laughed bitterly, threw his hand hard, and threw the short stick against the wall. The short stick hit the wall with a loud noise, and fell again, falling to a corner of the house.</p>
<p>The gray monkey was startled and looked up at Zhang Xiaofan, wondering why he lost his temper. Zhang Xiaofan sighed, took off his shoes and went to bed, covered his bed with a quilt and slept. The monkey touched his head, unknown.</p>
<p>This night, Zhang Xiaofan turned back and forth, hungry and unbearable. It was only late at night that he fell asleep.</p>
