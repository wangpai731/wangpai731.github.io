      <p>The Seven Veins Meeting Martial Arts is a grand event for the Qingyunmen Yijiazi. There are hundreds more people on the Tongtian Peak, and the accommodation naturally becomes tense. Dazhufeng people want to live the kind of free time on Dazhufeng one by one, that is delusion. Except for Tian Ling&rsquo;er who lived in Xiaozhufeng&rsquo;s daughters, Dazhufeng started with Song Daren. There were seven male disciples, all packed in a room.</p>
<p>On Tongtian Peak, Qingyunâ€™s residence has always been a room for four people. At this time, three floors were paved in the room, which was crowded out anyway, but it was inevitable that it was overcrowded. At this moment, I only heard someone complaining loudly: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s true, all day saying how good the Nagato is. Now it is really stingy to ask the seven of us to squeeze a room!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sixth, don&rsquo;t complain, if it is heard by the long brothers, it will be bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Second Brother, you are naturally comfortable in bed. Why not look at my brother and I lie on the cold ground, why not change our bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whirring whirring&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;No, you fell asleep all at once and still snore?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whirring whirring&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph, ah, Brother Si, you have always been handsome and chic. Liu. Suo talents are talented&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whirring whirring&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, is it very popular now to fall asleep instantly? Hey, Master, you have always been kind, how can you look at my brother&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whirring whirring&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&ndash;ah, Brother Three&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roar roar roar&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everyone was frightened, when the wall suddenly rang loudly, and someone next door shouted angrily: &ldquo;Hello, do you guys at Dazhufeng sleep so loudly at night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The room was suddenly quiet. After a long time, I didn&rsquo;t know who secretly laughed a few times. Later, the voice suddenly seemed to remember something: &ldquo;Ah, Brother Wu&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You, you, what are you, I sleep next to you, all on the ground, do you want to change positions, I don&rsquo;t care!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cough, it&rsquo;s okay. Alas, it&rsquo;s just a cold shop here, but it&rsquo;s still a bit short, and I can&rsquo;t sleep comfortably. Speaking of it, it&rsquo;s still a good little brother, and my figure is just right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Six Brothers, why are you talking with your eyes closed? Didn&rsquo;t you see that I still have a big dog and a monkey grabbing the quilt with me? The most crowded is me here, do you still say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;But I still&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut up, old sixth!&rdquo; several people in the room shouted at the same time.</p>
<p>After dark, there were many other six-discipline young disciples who came to Tongtianfeng for the first time to take a walk. They were amazed and curious about the scenery of Tongtianfeng, but as the night grew darker, everyone also went back to their rooms to sleep.</p>
<p>When darkness descended on this high mountain peak, above the sky, a cold moon sprinkled Qinghui towards the top of the mountain.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan slept soundly, suddenly feeling a little moved around, dimly opening his sleepy eyes, but saw the little gray monkey and big yellow lying beside him disappeared. He propped himself up and looked around. He saw a big yellow-yellow figure flashing past the door, a shadow on his back, most of which looked like a little gray monkey.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s heart is strange, the night is so deep, this monkey and the dog are going to go, and now he climbs lightly and lightly, approves a piece of clothing indiscriminately, and walks to the door, only to see that in the cold moonlight, rhubarb is back He hurried to Yunhai with Xiao Hui.</p>
<p>Looking at the direction they ran, Zhang Xiaofan thought about it, and remembered that it was the location of the Tongtianfeng kitchen that Song Daren told himself earlier. Nowadays it&rsquo;s irritating and funny. This rhubarb is not easy to be kept by Tian. I don&rsquo;t know it for hundreds of years. It can be regarded as a good old dog, but it is so greedy. He wanted to go back to sleep, but when he thought about it, he thought that if someone saw the big dog&rsquo;s yellow dog gray monkey stealing food, it was too ugly, and he had to chase them back.</p>
<p>He decided in his heart to look up, but he saw that Da Huang was carrying a little gray on his back, and there was only one fuzzy figure left at the moment, and he hurriedly chased it.</p>
<p>He sprinted all the way, cautiously on the way, and did not disturb the same door in other rooms. When he ran over the square in the sea of â€‹â€‹clouds, he could no longer see the shadows of rhubarb and small gray. I saw that under the cold moon, the clouds were floating lightly here. , Such as yarn like smoke, beautiful.</p>
<p>However, he glanced at it for a second time, then he didn&rsquo;t think about it anymore, turned his head to look around, and then walked in the direction of the kitchen. Suddenly, his heart jumped.</p>
<p>Deep in the sea of â€‹â€‹clouds, on the other side of the direction of the kitchen, there is a slim figure faintly in the cloud, walking forward, looking at the direction of the man&rsquo;s walking, it seems to be walking towards Hongqiao.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan looked at the figure staring blankly, even though he was far away, but the figure was carved deeply into his heart, and he recognized at a glance that it was Sister Tian Ling&rsquo;er.</p>
<p>The night is so deep!</p>
<p>Why did she go out alone, and where would she go alone?</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was stunned for a while, and he felt at a loss for a while. He just felt that there were hundreds of thoughts in his head, and his heart was as chaotic as if he guessed something vaguely, but he still refused to admit it.</p>
<p>He turned his head, staring at the direction of the kitchen where Da Huang Xiao Hui ran, cruelly, walked there, and said to himself: &ldquo;Zhang Xiaofan, you donâ€™t have to do business! You donâ€™t have to do business!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this way, seven steps were taken, and Yuehua was like water, shone on this young man, and was very lonely. Then he stopped and looked up at the sky, only to see a cold moon hanging on the horizon. There seemed to be a movement in his mouth. After a while, he turned around quickly, clenching his teeth, and ran in the direction where the figure disappeared.</p>
<p>The moonlight shone on his running figure, with a desolate tenderness.</p>
<p>After a while, Tian Linger&rsquo;s figure disappeared into the sea of â€‹â€‹clouds, but Zhang Xiaofan didn&rsquo;t look at other places, and ran toward Hongqiao. Soon, he got on the Hongqiao, and the mountain breeze blew. The water on both sides of the Hongqiao rippled slightly, reflecting the moon in the sky, cold and beautiful, but Zhang Xiaofan ignored it all but ran hard.</p>
<p>Run, run, run!</p>
<p>Running across Hongqiao, he still hasn&rsquo;t seen anyone&rsquo;s shadow. Until he ran to the end of Hongqiao, there was a sudden sorrow in his heart, and the cold moonlight lit the blue water pool at the end of Hongqiao as bright as day, and saw a beautiful figure, standing by the beautiful pool, staring at the sparkling water, stunned. Fascinated.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan suddenly became afraid, a kind of fear that he couldn&rsquo;t tell himself. He only knew that he couldn&rsquo;t let the sister discover. He glanced around and saw that there was a small wood near the Hongqiao Bridge on the right-hand side of Tanbian. He ran quietly and hid there. From the shadow, he secretly looked at Tian Ling&rsquo;er.</p>
<p>This look seems to be eternal!</p>
<p>Under the moonlight, by the clear water, the young woman with a little sadness, a little anticipation, lowered her eyebrows, her eyes seemed to have a faint radiance, and she seemed to be looking forward to something so beautiful. The mountain breeze, the wind over the water, passed by her side, also held his breath, stopped the sound, gently flicked her coat hair, lined with snow-like skin.</p>
<p>In Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s deep heart, suddenly an indescribable gentleness rose, as if the woman was the person he wanted to protect in his life, even though he had gone through all sorts of disasters for her, he did not hesitate and never regretted it.</p>
<p>At this moment, much hope is eternal!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sister Linger.&rdquo; Suddenly, with a cry, Tian Linger turned around, and his eyes were instantly filled with joy, and a sincere smile appeared in the corner of his mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brother Qi, you are here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s heart seemed to be broken at that moment, but he didn&rsquo;t feel any pain. The whole heart was empty, only echoing the sentence &ldquo;Brother Qi, Brother Qi, Brother Qi&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned his head hard, and saw that he walked quickly on the Hongqiao bridge, Jianmei star, handsome, outstanding, but not Qi Hao who.</p>
<p>I saw that Qi Hao walked quickly to Tian Ling&rsquo;er and said warmly: &ldquo;Sorry, my brothers and sisters are young and naughty, and they have been late to sleep, so they came late, and you have been waiting for a long time. .&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Ling&rsquo;er was a little angry, but somehow, when he saw Qi Hao&rsquo;s figure, he disappeared without a trace. He shook his head and smiled: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay, I haven&rsquo;t been here for a long time.&rdquo; She glanced at the water hole beside her, and said, &ldquo;But why did you want to meet here to meet? During the day, Ling Zun suddenly became angry. I&rsquo;m still a little scared now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Qi Hao said with a smile: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay, I heard Master say that Spiritual Respect is as usual, just a joke with our young disciples, and it is so noisy during the day, it is more clean here at night, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Linger&rsquo;s face was red, and he lowered his head and said, &ldquo;We see each other secretly, don&rsquo;t we know if we are good?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Qi Hao looked at her gentle and beautiful face and said softly, &ldquo;Sister Ling&rsquo;er, since we first met at Dazhufeng two years ago, I have missed you, and the lovesickness is hard to stop. Your shadow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Ling&rsquo;er bit his lips subconsciously, his face red again, but he didn&rsquo;t mean to be angry, but there was a trace of sweetness in his heart.</p>
<p>Qi Hao said again: &ldquo;Sister Linger, I&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Ling&rsquo;er suddenly looked up and said: &ldquo;Brother Qi, you can just call me Linger.&rdquo; At this point, she suddenly lowered her head and whispered, &ldquo;I, my father and mother all call me that. &quot;</p>
<p>Qi Hao was overjoyed, as if he didn&rsquo;t believe his ears yet, and hesitated before asking: &ldquo;Really, Ling, Linger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Ling&rsquo;er glanced at him, reached into his arms and slowly took out a small brocade box, his eyes dropped, looking at the ground, it seemed that he had the courage to whisper: &ldquo;This&rsquo;cool bead&rsquo;, my two I have been carrying it with me for years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After she said this, she dared not look at Qi Hao again, but after a long time, Qi Hao didn&rsquo;t have a voice. Tian Ling&rsquo;er felt strange, and secretly looked up at him, but Qi Hao&rsquo;s eyes were full of joy, with a smile on her face, saying no Out of happiness.</p>
<p>The two of them stared at each other for a long time, suddenly opened their arms and hugged each other.</p>
<p>Yuehua coldly sprinkled on them, sprinkled in the woods, but did not shine in the dark corners.</p>
<p>I donâ€™t know how long it took. The couple spoke soft and secret words until Qi Hao looked at the sky and saw that the moon had passed Dongtian. He said: &ldquo;Ling&rsquo;er, it&rsquo;s getting early, let&rsquo;s go back, otherwise, I found it was always bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Ling&rsquo;er thought about it and nodded. The two of them looked at each other, and suddenly they all smiled. Everything was silent. Qi Hao took Tian Ling&rsquo;er&rsquo;s hand and walked slowly towards Hongqiao. The two were like a pair of intimate mandarin ducks in the moonlight. It took a while before it disappeared on Hongqiao.</p>
<p>This night was a little bit more bleak.</p>
<p>In the shadow of the woods, Zhang Xiaofan walked out slowly and walked to the edge of the Bishuitan. He looked at the sparkling water and the cold moon reflected in the water. As the water wave flirted, it gently shook.</p>
<p>He suddenly wanted to cry.</p>
<p>However, he didn&rsquo;t cry after all, the inexplicable pain rushed around like a wild beast in his heart, causing scars everywhere in his heart.</p>
<p>However, he gritted his teeth and said nothing.</p>
<p>It seemed as if he had returned to what he was five years ago. At that time, he lost everything, except for Lin Jingyu beside him. This world has completely changed.</p>
<p>And tonight, at this time, he was alone, facing alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roar&rdquo;, a low sound, sounded like a snorting of some kind of beast. Suddenly sounded behind him, Zhang Xiaofan woke up from the confused emotion, looked back, and suddenly felt a cold sweat.</p>
<p>I saw the spirit beast of Qingyunmen Town, the behemoth water unicorn that everyone respected as &ldquo;Ling Zun&rdquo;, suddenly appeared silently behind him at the moment, and leaned very close, bowed his head, like a pair of giant eyes Just sticking to Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s body, I don&rsquo;t know how it is so big. How could it be done, maybe Zhang Xiaofan was heartbroken, not necessarily aware of it.</p>
<p>But at the moment Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s heart almost jumped out of his chest, seeing this water unicorn&rsquo;s huge body like a hill right in front of him, and the long, sharp fangs in the big mouth of the blood basin were shining in the moonlight, only scaring She had to step back a few times and stumbled, but was tripped to the ground by a big rock.</p>
<p>When he came out, his shirt was originally disheveled, but he just wobbled one piece at random. At the moment, he shook his body, only listening to the sound of &ldquo;clang&rdquo;, and something fell to the ground.</p>
<p>The sound spread quickly in this calm place, echoing above the water.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan and Shui Qilin looked down at the same time, only to see on the ground by the water, in the middle of Zhang Xiaofan and Shui Qilin, a black so-called &ldquo;burning fire stick&rdquo; was lying there quietly.</p>
<p>A pair of giant eyes in the water unicorn, reflected Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s pale face and the ugly fire stick on the ground. Zhang Xiaofan only felt that his throat was dry, and cold sweat was pouring down, desperately shouting &ldquo;Run, run, run!!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just before Shui Qilin, no matter how delusional he was in his heart, his feet seemed to be not his own, and he didn&rsquo;t move. Shui Qilin was a little strange at the moment. After looking at Zhang Xiaofan, his attention seemed to be attracted by the burning stick. I saw this giant beast staring at the black burning fire stick, looked up and down, a big head turned and turned back, but never saw anything. After a moment, as if hesitating, it stretched out its front paws and moved the burning stick cautiously.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was stunned on the side, although he was still very scared, but his curiosity was rising at the same time, thinking that this &ldquo;Ling Zun&rdquo; could have been confused for thousands of years, or was it the big rhubarb on Dazhu Peak? Dogs are generally old and disrespectful, and their childlike innocence is so interesting that they are so interested in a burning stick?</p>
<p>I saw Shui Qilin&rsquo;s huge claws lightly touched the burning fire stick, and then immediately retracted it. It seemed that he was very afraid of the stick, but the burning fire stick moved a little, rolled a few times, and still lying peacefully. There is no movement.</p>
<p>Shui Qilin&rsquo;s eyes were confused, but he still refused to give up. The huge head flicked, and suddenly looked at Zhang Xiaofan, a deep but powerful roar came from the big mouth of the blood basin. Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s heart jumped suddenly, tightening his muscles all at once, and even stopped breathing.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, Shui Qilin just glanced at him, then looked at the burning stick again, and this time, he actually lowered his head, put his nose over the stick, and sniffed carefully. Zhang Xiaofan jumped up and down in one heart, but looking at the strange behavior of the giant beast in front of him, he subconsciously thought that this is not like rhubarb. If he was not too nervous at the moment, he would almost laugh.</p>
<p>Shui Qilin sniffed for a while, and apparently still got nothing. He raised his head and looked around. His head seemed to be confused and confused. But after all, the Millennium Spirit Beast is a Millennium Spirit Beast. After thinking about it for a moment, he decided to give up. He saw the water unicorn snorted, and looked at Zhang Xiaofan with a giant eye. He only scared Zhang Xiaofan to death, and shook his head and turned to walk down. The water pool was not nearly full, the water splashed, and the huge body did not enter the pool.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was so shocked that he slowly climbed up, and then he felt that the shirt behind him was completely wet, not to mention the cold sweat on his forehead like rain. He went to the fire stick, picked it up, and looked up and down, but he couldn&rsquo;t see anything strange. He could not help complaining loudly, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a hell!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The voice did not fall, and suddenly I heard a sound of water from the side of the Bishuitan. The boss turned up a splash of water. In the white waves, I saw the giant tail of the water unicorn vaguely turning out of the water.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was taken aback. He immediately put the burning stick in his arms and ran away. He only heard the sound of the water in the pool behind him. He didn&rsquo;t dare to look back. He just ran away as far away as possible. After a while, he ran up to Hongqiao and ran straight up until he could no longer hear a voice behind him, and stopped until he reached the top of Hongqiao, gasping for breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Call, call, call!&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s breathing slowly calmed down, but he suddenly felt very tired, a kind of tiredness from his deep heart, lowered his head, and saw a lonely shadow always following him under the moonlight.</p>
<p>Suddenly he looked up and looked up at the sky. He saw a cold sky, a cold moon, and a sky above him. He stared at it stunnedly for a while.</p>
<p>â€»â€»â€»</p>
<p>In the early morning, everyone woke up.</p>
<p>Du Bishu rubbed his waist and complained loudly: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s true. After a night of sleep, my waist almost broke. How can I compare today?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Old Wu Lu Daxin frowned: &ldquo;Lao Liu, don&rsquo;t yell, I also slept all night, and I didn&rsquo;t feel any problems with my waist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren also said: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, you complained to the sixth night last night, is it not enough? Didn&rsquo;t you watch the old five and the younger brother have no voice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Du Bishu blamed his eyes and said, &ldquo;Brother Wu is thick and fleshy. I don&rsquo;t feel it. If you don&rsquo;t believe me, ask Junior Brother to see him&hellip; Hey, Junior Brother, why are you full of blood, last night? Did you sleep well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan packed his bedding, sitting in a chair at the moment, staring out of the window, unresponsive, while rhubarb was lying at his feet, monkey Xiaohui was flipping rhubarb&rsquo;s dog hair, as if looking for lice.</p>
<p>Du Bishu walked over and patted his shoulder heavily. Zhang Xiaofan was excited, jumped up, and shocked Rhubarb and Xiaohui. He turned his head to look around and said, &ldquo;What, what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Du Bishu frowned: &ldquo;Xiaofan, why don&rsquo;t you stay at home, didn&rsquo;t you sleep last night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan froze for a moment and shook his head: &ldquo;No, no.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Du Bishu said: &ldquo;Then why are you full of bloodshot eyes, red?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was just about to speak, and He Dazhi, who came by, said: &ldquo;Sixth, donâ€™t worry about anything. The younger brotherâ€™s spirit is not bad anymore. Anyway, heâ€™s in a hurry today, but you donâ€™t wash any more, and you will be late for the test, then But no one can blame others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Du Bishu suddenly realized that wherever Zhang Xiaofan had not slept well, he rushed over and completely ignored Lu Daxin, Zheng Dali and others who were washing his face, grabbed the washbasin, plopped and splashed water on his face, and said in his mouth: &ldquo;Huh, Brother Xiao is just destined. Look at his dying face and sleep. Itâ€™s really&hellip; Ah, Brother Five, return the washbasin to me, Iâ€™m too late!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bah, I haven&rsquo;t washed it myself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan watched a few brothers arguing over a washbasin on the other side of the room. Feeling bored in his heart, he stood up and went out. He was walking to the door. Song Daren suddenly called out behind him: &ldquo;Little Brother, you washed Is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan turned his head and said, &ldquo;Washed, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren nodded and said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s good, it doesn&rsquo;t matter if you go out first, but you will have to go to the dining room for breakfast after a while, you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan responded and said, &ldquo;I see.&rdquo; He walked out, and the monkey Xiaohui squeaked twice and ran over to his shoulders. Rhubarb saw that Xiaohui was gone and crawled lazily. He got up, shook his tail, and walked out. Above the corridor, Zhang Xiaofan saw that the left and right of the brothers and sisters of the Qingyun Gate had just got up and busy. He walked in a walk and unconsciously walked onto Yunhai Square.</p>
<p>It was still early at this time, and only three, two, two, twenty, two, and two disciples of Qingyun walked above the sea of â€‹â€‹clouds. The cool mountain breeze blew across Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s face, and there was a cold feeling.</p>
<p>As if last night!</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan felt a pain in his heart. He was already a sixteen-year-old boy. He lived on Dazhu Peak for five years. He and Tian Ling&rsquo;er lived with him day and night. He had been deeply rooted in this beautiful and lively sister since childhood. Unexpectedly, I witnessed Tian Ling&rsquo;er and Qi Hao&rsquo;s private meeting with my own eyes last night.</p>
<p>At the moment, his brain was messy, and the flashing scenes were all the scenes that made him heartbroken last night, and the whole person walked aimlessly without the spirit of the Lord.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo; Suddenly, there was an exclamation. Suddenly it sounded beside him. He surprised Zhang Xiaofan, woke up from his delusion, and looked to his side, but he was a young Qingyun disciple, with beautiful facial features, a robe, twenty up and down, hands Holding a gold fan, there seemed to be some mountains, rivers and rivers drawn on it, but at the moment it came up, but a pair of bright big eyes did not look at Zhang Xiaofan, but stared straight at the monkey on the shoulder of Zhang Xiaofan. stop.</p>
