      <p>This morning, everyone on the Dazhu Peak of Qingyunmen was in high spirits, especially the disciples, all smiling, although there was no lack of tension, but most of them were submerged in excitement.</p>
<p>Among all the people, only the master brother Song Daren and the second son Wu Dayi, the third son Zheng Dali, the fourth elder He Dazhi, and the old Wu Lu Daxin and the sixth elder Du Bishu were all not easy. The disciples newly recruited in the past ten years, as well as the young Tian Ling&rsquo;er and Zhang Xiaofan, have never even seen the Qingyunmen&rsquo;s once grand event.</p>
<p>Tian Ling&rsquo;er was most happy at the moment, taking advantage of the difficult preparations of the Tian Yi and his wife, lingering on Song Daren, the most experienced, and he kept asking, &ldquo;Master, do you really have so many fellows in Qimaihuiwu?&rdquo; &quot;</p>
<p>With a smile on his face, Song Daren is obviously in a very good mood. He said: &ldquo;Yes, the Seven Vessels Meeting Wuwu is the biggest event of our door, and every line of the same door regards it as the most important event. And he can be selected to represent all the brothers and brothers in the same line. It’s not just a standout character, let alone the spectacular excitement of that scene.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this time, the fourth elder He Dazhi heard it and walked over, secretly blinked at Tian Ling&rsquo;er and smiled, &ldquo;Sister Sister, you don&rsquo;t know, in fact, the master has nothing to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Ling&rsquo;er yelled, ignoring Song Daren&rsquo;s expression, and asked, &ldquo;What, Brother Sis?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He Dazhi smiled and said, &ldquo;Hundreds of people from the same gate gathered at the Huiwu test site. The winner stood on the stage and applauded thunderously. That triumph was not going to run, but if there were some beautiful and new young men Brother Master&rsquo;s demeanor, screaming and cheering, wouldn&rsquo;t that be a big pleasure in life?&rdquo; At this point, he turned to Song Daren seriously, saying: &ldquo;Brother Master, aren&rsquo;t you saying that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren&rsquo;s face suddenly turned red.</p>
<p>Tian Ling&rsquo;er looked strange in his eyes and said, &ldquo;Master, why are you suddenly blushing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren shook his head like a rattle, and repeatedly said: &ldquo;No, no, how can I be red&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He Dazhi coughed, but he saw the other brothers and brothers around him somehow. When the younger ones such as Du Bishu and Zhang Xiaofan were gone, Wu Dayi and Zheng Dali both smiled and smiled: &ldquo;Oh, Brother Two and Brother Three are also here. Recently, my memory is not good. It seems that in the last big test, when the Masters won two games in a row and entered the third round, there was a young and beautiful fellow sister, Huh, I forgot my name&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wu Dayi immediately said: &ldquo;Ah, I don&rsquo;t remember it well, but it seems to be a sister from the same school on Xiaozhu Peak. It looks very beautiful, but the name&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zheng Dali smiled with a smile on his face and said, &ldquo;We all forget the name, but we clapped the loudest clap in the field that day, and we still remember the look of the man who was frowning with the master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as this remark came out, everyone was in an uproar, and Tian Linger took the lead to torture: &ldquo;Brother, who is the same sister, who is so good to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren was embarrassed, and he gave He Dazhi a hard look and said with a smile: &ldquo;No, there is no such thing, don&rsquo;t listen to the elder brothers talking nonsense, Xiaomin Feng&rsquo;s sister Wen Min is only for the sake of the mother and daughter. Cheers more cheer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo; He Dazhi immediately said: &ldquo;Brother, this is strange. I don&rsquo;t know the name of the second brother and the third brother. Why did you say the name of the person immediately? But Sister Wen Min That&rsquo;s good for Brother&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everyone laughed, and Song Daren knew that he was wrong, and he knew that the Analects was far from how Dazhi, the first shrewd person in the Dazhu Peak Gate, said more mistakes and snorted at the moment. : &ldquo;Boring people, hey, shall I go and see the master and the maid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Ling&rsquo;er was still to be questioned, but he saw that Song Daren slipped faster than the wind, and no one could see the figure in a blink of an eye. He had to grab He Dazhi, and Shui Lingling&rsquo;s big eyes were full of excitement, saying: &ldquo;Brother Sis, Hurry up and talk about how the sister Wen Min looks like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He Dazhi said with a smile: &ldquo;Sister Xiaomei, don&rsquo;t you often go back to Xiaozhufeng and visit Master Shuiyue with your sister, how could you never see Sister Wenmin, she is a proud disciple of Master Shuiyue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Ling&rsquo;er shook his head and said, &ldquo;When I went to Xiaozhufeng with my mother, I went directly to Master Shuiyue. It is rare to know a few sisters from the same class. Hurry up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He Dazhi said with a smile: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, don&rsquo;t worry, today we will go to Changmentong Tianfeng to participate in the Seven Veins meeting martial arts, most of you will see her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Ling&rsquo;er sighed, his eyes rolled, as if he was awake, saying: &ldquo;No wonder I got up early in the morning to see the whole brother&rsquo;s spirits, it turned out to be a ghost!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everyone stayed for a while, and immediately understood it, laughing loudly, and Tian Ling&rsquo;er himself laughed, and a little nervous about Qimai Huiwu also turned into invisible. Her eyes moved, and everyone saw a smile on her face, and she was in a good mood. But when she saw Zhang Xiaofan, she was suddenly startled. Although Zhang Xiaofan had a smile on her face, Tian Ling&rsquo;er had been closest to him in recent years. At a glance he saw that he seemed a little absent-minded.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of everyone&rsquo;s laughter, Tian Ling&rsquo;er secretly pulled Zhang Xiaofan aside and whispered: &ldquo;Xiaofan, what are you doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was startled, his mouth moved, his right hand touched his chest subconsciously, and finally said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine, sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Ling&rsquo;er looked at him and said straight, &ldquo;What can I show you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan hesitated, took out the things in his arms, and gave Tian Ling&rsquo;er a look. Tian Ling&rsquo;er didn&rsquo;t look well, but when he looked at it, he was even more surprised, saying: &ldquo;You put this black What does the burning stick take with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was astonished at Tian Ling&rsquo;er, but even with a little anger in his face, it was so beautiful. Na Nadao said: &ldquo;Master grace, let me go to see it too. I am shallow, there is no magic weapon, nor will use……&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Ling&rsquo;er suddenly realized, but couldn&rsquo;t help but laugh and said, &ldquo;Ah, hehe, that&rsquo;s it. Then, do you take this and this burning stick to participate in the Seven Veins Meeting? Qingyun Gate has been out for two thousand years. The six brothers who made the dice magic weapon were already weird. Unexpectedly, unexpectedly you, you actually took a burning stick&hellip;hahahaha, me, I laughed to death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The disciples on the side of Dazhufeng heard Tian Ling&rsquo;er burst into laughter suddenly, and came over, asking for the reason, but they couldn&rsquo;t help but laugh again. Zhang Xiaofan saw that there were smiling and happy brothers and sisters all around him. Suddenly there was a burst of anger.</p>
<p>The anger in this deep heart flew in the blink of an eye, but it was so strong that it almost suffocated Zhang Xiaofan.</p>
<p>He lowered his head and held the ugly burning stick tightly, and the familiar cold came to his palm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Xiaofan,&rdquo; Tian Ling&rsquo;er smiled suddenly, and said straightly: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was shocked and raised his head.</p>
<p>Tian Ling&rsquo;er said: &ldquo;I originally thought of giving you a baby to support the facade, so as not to go out and be joked by other fellow students. But these days my mother forced me to practice too hard, I will forget.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan shook his head subconsciously and said, &ldquo;Sister, your practice is important, you don&rsquo;t have to miss me anymore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Ling&rsquo;er patted his shoulder and smiled, &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s nothing. Everyone knows your skills. This time it&rsquo;s a long experience.&rdquo; She lowered her voice. &ldquo;If anyone bullies you, You must come over and say to me, hum, I&rsquo;ll start for you immediately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan looked at Sister&rsquo;s kind eyes and did not doubt her promise, even the kindness in the words of everyone around him, he could feel it. But, but what emotion is still so surging, what kind of flame is burning in the deep heart, so that he can hardly breathe?</p>
<p>Tian Ling&rsquo;er still smiled and patted the shoulder of her favorite little teacher, whispering: &ldquo;Tell you, there are more fun places on Tongtianfeng, this time we go to play secretly, okay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan shook the beautiful face in front of her, and suddenly dared not look directly at her face. She lowered her head, and her heart was sweet and troubled. The teenager&rsquo;s thoughts seemed to be mixed, and whispered: &ldquo;Yes, sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Ling&rsquo;er smiled and suddenly heard He Dazhi say, &ldquo;Master and the maid are here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everyone turned around and saw that Tian Shou and Su Ru came out of the Shoujing Church. Tian is not easy to wear a sky blue robe, and his dignity is quite solemn. If it is not a little short, and his stomach is a little bigger, it really has a respectable master style. As for Su Ru, she made everyone look bright, and she was so beautiful. Today, she wore a pale green dress, with jade flowers on her head, gold hairpin, and eyebrows like mountains and daisies. His eyes are like water, his red lips are smiling, and he really dumps sentient beings.</p>
<p>Song Daren followed his husband and wife, his face could not be more serious. It was just that when the young brothers saw him, weird expressions on their faces appeared to be unremarkable and seemingly non-smiling. Behind Song Daren, Yellow Dog Rhubarb and Monkey Little Gray also followed. Xiaohui seems to be used to sitting on Dahuang&rsquo;s back now. When he saw Zhang Xiaofan standing in front, he squeaked a few times, jumped from Dahuang&rsquo;s back, and jumped to Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s place. Put it on his shoulder.</p>
<p>Tian was not easy to look at the disciples, nodded, and said, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo; Then, he waved his right hand, the palm of the law, and the red light flashed, his long-known fairy &ldquo;Red Spirit&rdquo; sacrificed, Chimang, the Xianjia treasure. Tian wasn’t about to step forward, but suddenly the pants were pulled by someone, and when he looked back, he was bitten by rhubarb. I saw that the yellow dog he raised since he was a child shook his head and shook his head. (Trousers) cries, the tail shakes vigorously, a pair of dogs&rsquo; eyes blink even without blinking, staring straight at Tian is not easy to see.</p>
<p>Tian was not hesitant to say a word vaguely in his mouth, but he still waved his sleeves, rolled up the rhubarb, then floated on the Chi Ling sword, and said hello to Su Ru, then broke away.</p>
<p>Su Ru smiled and shook his head, and said to everyone: &ldquo;Come on, too.&rdquo; After a pause, he said to Song Daren, &ldquo;Daren, Xiao Fanxiu is not enough, you take him away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren nodded and said, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru nodded, not seeing how she was acting, a light green light flashed, as if matching her clothes, carrying her straight up to the blue sky, chasing Tian Nan&rsquo;s red light.</p>
<p>Among the disciples of Dazhufeng, Wu Dayi, Zheng Dali and Lv Daxin did not reach the fourth level and could not drive away the magic weapon. Now Song Daren walks towards Zhang Xiaofan, and the rest of He Dazhi, Du Bishu and Tian Ling&rsquo;er take their own one and go on their way. Among the people, Tian Ling&rsquo;er&rsquo;s magic weapon is &ldquo;Amber Zhu Ling&rdquo;, and He Dazhi&rsquo;s magic weapon is a &ldquo;jiangshan pen&rdquo;, which fits his habit of loving books, but the most funny is the dice of the old six Du Bishu. The magic weapon, once sacrificed, the white light flashed, the three dice drip magnified ten times, spinning around in the air, and various numbers appeared in turns. If you talk about the world&rsquo;s gambling equipment, there is nothing more than that.</p>
<p>Old Wu Lv Daxin carefully stepped forward to look closely and said to Du Bi with a bitter face: &ldquo;Lao Liu, shouldn&rsquo;t this thing fall from the sky?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Du Bishu raised his eyebrows, and said with a hippie smile: &ldquo;Five Brothers, let&rsquo;s make a bet. If you fall from the sky, even if you win, I will&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Daxin said, &ldquo;Bah, Bah,&rdquo; said: &ldquo;Do I dare to win this bet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Du Bishu froze for a moment and said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren walked to Zhang Xiaofan and smiled, &ldquo;Xiaofan, are you ready?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was about to nod. Suddenly the little monkey Xiaohui on his shoulder screamed. The two were taken aback, but after seeing Xiaohui pointed at the sky for a while, and at Zhang Xiaofan, he pointed at himself. Zhang Xiaofan froze for a moment. &ldquo;Are you going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xiao Hui immediately grinned, Zhang Xiaofan hesitated, looked at Song Daren, Song Daren thought for a while, and said with a smile: &ldquo;Anyway Master has taken rhubarb, let&rsquo;s take Xiao Hui.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan rejoiced in his heart and nodded, Xiao Hui was even more rejoicing.</p>
<p>Song Daren turned and said to the rest of the people: &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go too, or Master will be scolded again later.&rdquo; Everyone promised that they each left the magic weapon, and Tian Linger went to Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s side before leaving and told him: &ldquo;Be careful Ah, pay close attention to Brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan nodded and said, &ldquo;Got it, sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Ling&rsquo;er smiled at him, and the trick was introduced. Amber Zhu Lingxia lighted up and walked away. Song Daren immediately sacrificed his magic sword &ldquo;Ten Tigers&rdquo;. He is a great disciple of Dazhufeng. Although the magic skills of the disciples are different, he still cultivates the fairy sword. The &ldquo;Ten Tiger&rdquo; Immortal Sword is yellow, four feet long, and three fingers wide. The size of the Immortal Sword is relatively large, but it is a pity that the magic power cannot be calculated by body size.</p>
<p>At the moment, Song Daren pulled Zhang Xiaofan up. Zhang Xiaofan had the experience of riding Tian Ling&rsquo;er Amber Zhu Ling before, and the &ldquo;Ten Tigers&rdquo; at the foot sank down, and then he stabilized. Knowing what, grabbed Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s head tightly.</p>
<p>Song Daren smiled slightly and said, &ldquo;Little brother, let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo; He said that his right-hand trick pointed to Tian, ​​and only heard a low trembling sound from the sword body of the &ldquo;Ten Tigers&rdquo;, which was originally flatly floating away from the ground. The one-foot fairy sword suddenly rose three feet, and Zhang Xiaofan subconsciously grasped Song Daren.</p>
<p>At this time, a mountain breeze blew, and the tip of the &ldquo;Ten Tiger&rdquo; sword slowly tilted upwards, and by about seven points, Zhang Xiaofan was pulling tightly on Song Daren.</p>
<p>When it didn&rsquo;t fall down, there was a screaming place, and the &ldquo;Ten Tigers&rdquo; rushed straight up towards the sky.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan stood above the fairy sword and hugged Song Daren tightly. Although his heart was tense, he could not bear to close his eyes anyway. I saw Dazhufeng&rsquo;s verdant peaks getting farther and farther away from him. Suddenly, his eyes were white, and the whiteness was actually pierced into the thick white clouds, and he could no longer see anything.</p>
<p>At this time, there was a lot of clouds, and the wind was roaring, the shaving was painful, Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s body shivered slightly, half nervous, half excited. What a dream it is to ride between the blue sky and white clouds!</p>
<p>The sea of ​​clouds was vast, and I didn&rsquo;t know how long it was. Just when Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s mood was slowly recovering, it seemed to surprise him again. The &ldquo;Ten Tiger&rdquo; fairy sword rushed out of the sea of ​​clouds in the sharp roar of breaking the sky.</p>
<p>The endless blue sky, like the deep sea hanging upside down, is almost pure blue, endless and magnificent. When they rushed out of the sea of ​​clouds, the white clouds under their feet looked like water splashes. With their castration, a long cloud of gas appeared, seeming to be reluctant, like the big waves of the river, floating in the air, and then slowly falling back to the sea of ​​clouds. .</p>
<p>The sky is like a wash, the &ldquo;Ten Tigers&rdquo; immortal sword rises into the sky, and until it reaches a height of almost three hundred feet from the vast cloud sea under his feet, Song Daren laid the sword flat and began to go straight in the direction of Tongtianfeng.</p>
<p>In the distance, a majestic mountain towering high into the sky, no, standing proudly. There, in the misty white clouds, there are faint bells reverberating in this sky and earth. Tongtianfeng seems to really lead to Qingtian.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan held his breath and looked into the distance. The endless green world and the majestic mountain peaks were flying around countless rays of light. The closer to Tongtian Peak, the denser these rays were.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan knew that those were the magic weapons used by the disciples in Qingyun Gate. Because of the five elements of the magic weapon, they had different colors. They looked colorful and extremely beautiful. But seeing these lights shining like colored stones and rain, they all flocked to the mountain, and the scene was magnificent. Together with the &ldquo;Ten Tiger&rdquo; Immortal Sword, they quickly merged into this colorful torrent.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Accompanied by the howling, Song Daren took Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s Royal Sword on a huge square. As soon as it fell to the ground, the monkey Xiaohui looked away, then jumped off Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s shoulder and jumped on the square, excited. Zhang Xiaofan didn&rsquo;t care about it either. Looking around, he saw that the white jade was the column, the immortal air bursts, and there were nine large bronze tripods in the center of the square, which were placed in the middle of three or three. The most amazing thing is that above this square, the clouds are steaming, and when walking, as in the clouds, it makes people feel like immortals.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan saw it in his eyes and knew it well, remembering that it was the &ldquo;sea of ​​clouds&rdquo; in the so-called &ldquo;six scenes of green clouds&rdquo; he had visited when he first went to Mount Qingyun. I haven’t seen it for five years. It’s the same as before. There hasn’t been much change. It’s still so beautiful and ethereal.</p>
<p>Above the square, it is already very lively at this moment. The disciples who came to the Qingyun Gate to participate in the Qimai Huiwu are estimated to temporarily stop here. From a distance, their heads are shaking. I am afraid that there will not be hundreds of people. Most of the people standing in this square are dressed in Qingyunmen costumes, they are vulgar, there are men and women, especially the younger generation, and there are many heroic people. It can be seen that Qingyunmen has worked hard and cultivated in these years. Young disciple.</p>
<p>Although hundreds of people stood on the square, it still looked spacious. Song Daren looked around, suddenly heard a clear voice in the distance shouted: &ldquo;Brother, we are here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren and Zhang Xiaofan looked at it, and it was Dazhufeng everyone. Needless to say, Tian Ling&rsquo;er was standing next to a huge copper tripod in the middle of the square. Tian Ling&rsquo;er was waving at them.</p>
<p>Song Daren responded and walked over with Zhang Xiaofan. On the way, Zhang Xiaofan looked around and saw that the other disciples on the square stood together in groups of three and five. They all looked at what was happily talking about what they wanted. Look forward to the upcoming Huiwu Test.</p>
<p>They came to the front, and He Dazhi, who was standing behind Tian Ling&rsquo;er, said first: &ldquo;Brother, is this way going well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren smiled and said: &ldquo;This is not the first time here, what else can happen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Linger glanced at Zhang Xiaofan and smiled, &ldquo;Xiaofan, is the scenery on the road okay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan recalled the spectacular and breathtaking scenery above the blue sky just now, and sincerely said: &ldquo;Pretty beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Ling&rsquo;er smiled and patted his shoulder, saying: &ldquo;In the future, you will work harder, and learn to go to the sky after you learn the magic weapon, and let you fly to the blue sky every day to see enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan did not speak, but smiled and focused on the head.</p>
<p>Song Daren looked around and said to He Dazhi: &ldquo;How about the four younger brothers, Master and Mother-in-law?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He Dazhi said: &ldquo;Several of us came here with the master and the maid, and the receptionist Naomen Dao brought the master and the maid to Yuqingguan, saying that it was the first elder of the Seven Vessels to have a meeting, and finally discussed some details of the martial arts test. .. Master told us to wait here.”</p>
<p>Song Daren nodded, then beckoned, called all the younger brothers around, looked around, lowered his voice and said: &ldquo;How can I look at the other brothers and sisters who are born in different veins, you come here for a while , Is there any news?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He Dazhi shook his head and said: &ldquo;I also have this feeling, it seems that many new people have been recruited from the same door in these years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The second son, Wu Dayi, looked around and said, &ldquo;There are a lot of new people, but I estimate that when I wait for the test tomorrow, most of them are the fellows who have been intensively trained before. After all, they still have experience in practice&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren suddenly sighed and said, &ldquo;Second Junior Brother, this may not be the case. Do you remember Lin Jingyu, the young disciple sent by Longshoufeng two years ago?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wu Dayi was stunned, then silent, everyone looked at each other, did not speak, only Zhang Xiaofan suddenly had a complex emotion in his heart, seeming to rejoice, seemed to be envious, as if also brought a bit of envy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is that man?&rdquo; Suddenly someone said coldly.</p>
<p>Everyone was taken aback, but it was Tian Ling&rsquo;er who was talking, and she saw a pretty face flushed slightly, her eyes wide open, and she said hatefully: &ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t come to participate in this competition. If you dare to come, it’s better to ask him to meet me, and then I will share the victory with him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dazhufeng looked at each other, and the old sixth Du Bishu had always been clever and responded very fast. He smiled and said, &ldquo;The little sister said very much, if there is such a coincidence, hey, dear brothers, let&rsquo;s make a bet and see who loses and wins &hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go, go!&rdquo; The old five Lu Daxin standing beside him kicked him away.</p>
<p>Song Daren smiled for a while and was about to say something. He suddenly heard a slight cough behind him, and a woman whispered, &ldquo;Brother Song, I haven&rsquo;t seen you for a long time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren was suddenly hit hard.</p>
