      <p>&ldquo;Zhang Xiaofan!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A loud shout, sweet voice, but deafening. Zhang Xiaofan awakened from the dream, opened his eyes, and suddenly saw a big mouth, two rows of fangs, lying in front of his eyes, screamed in shock: &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Giggle&hellip;&rdquo; A laugh came from behind.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan finally settled down, only to see that there was a big yellow dog in front of him, half of them came to the height, a bright yellow hair, lying on his bed, and behind the yellow dog, Tian Linger was alone Red dress, tight-fitting dress, where he smiled and bent down.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan sneaked a glance at the big dog and saw that it was huge, with sharp fangs, and an old tongue spitting out, very vicious. He had never seen such a large dog. He was scared in his heart. He looked at Tian Ling&rsquo;er and smiled. He murmured and asked, &ldquo;Sister, what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; Tian Ling&rsquo;er said with a smile. Suddenly his face cleared, and he frowned, &ldquo;What do you ask me when the sky is bright? Get up quickly, and I will cut bamboo with you up the mountain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan stayed for a while and wondered: &ldquo;Are you going too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Ling&rsquo;er said: &ldquo;Nonsense, disciples must go up the mountain and cut the&rsquo;black bamboo&rsquo; in the first three years of entry. I started at the age of ten and this year is the last year. Hello, are you still in bed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan responded quickly, carefully bypassing the big dog, coming down from the other corner of the bed and putting on clothes with all his hands.</p>
<p>Tian Ling&rsquo;er shouted, &ldquo;Next.&rdquo; He threw a hatchet over.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan followed his hands and saw that it was an ordinary hatchet, which was quite heavy to start with. Prepared properly, he said to Tian Ling&rsquo;er: &ldquo;Sister, do you want to ask Master to go together?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Ling&rsquo;er gave him a blank look and said, &ldquo;Did you not hear me say that only introductory disciples should do their homework, and now it&rsquo;s only me and you who are going to cut bamboo, let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After finishing his move, Zhang Xiaofan didn&rsquo;t move yet, and saw the big yellow dog Huo Ran on the bed stood up, jumped out of bed, shook his tail, barked twice to Zhang Xiaofan &ldquo;Wang Wang&rdquo;, his teeth made a vicious look, and then ran away Go out.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan listened familiarly, remembering that he heard several barking dogs when he came back with his master yesterday. It seems that this is the big yellow dog, and he couldn&rsquo;t help but secretly said: &ldquo;The Qingyun Gate is so powerful that even raising dogs more casually than our village Is much bigger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He followed Tian Ling&rsquo;er out of the room, and he saw that it was still early, or early in the morning, walked out of the corridor to look at the back mountain, and in the distance there was a hazy mist drifting among the mountains.</p>
<p>These two men and a dog walked towards the back mountain of Dazhufeng in this way.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Zhang Xiaofan was held by Song Daren and walked to the hillside. I only felt that it would not be long before I walked, and the road was easy to walk. Unexpectedly, I walked only halfway today, and I realized that the slope is getting bigger and bigger, and the distance is more than I thought. It&rsquo;s much farther.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Tian Ling&rsquo;er next to him didn&rsquo;t use the &ldquo;Amber Zhu Ling&rdquo; today, and still walked with ease. The petite red figure swayed among the mountain roads, briskly. Needless to say, the big yellow dog was lively and unusual. After a while, after a while, he ran into the woods beside the road, and he didn’t know what to do. After a while, the sound of trees and trees started again. A bit out of it, very excited.</p>
<p>For another half hour, Zhang Xiaofan was exhausted and panting, his legs were sore and exhausted.</p>
<p>Tian Ling&rsquo;er walked ahead, looking at his appearance, and hummed, said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really useless, stop and rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan nodded quickly, sat down on the buttocks, and gasped desperately, but the big yellow dog was missing at the moment, and he didn&rsquo;t know where to go again.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan gasped for a while before slowly breathing out. He sat on the mountain road and looked down. He saw Dazhufeng standing tall, and the nearby mountains were all short and proud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sister, I have something to ask you, I don&rsquo;t know&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Ling&rsquo;er listened to his timid words. He looked at them with a pair of eyes, and he felt a little proud in his heart. He subconsciously straightened his hair with his hands, and his face was solemn, and he said straightly: &ldquo;You ask.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should we take cutting bamboo as homework, I think the homework is all about practicing Taoism?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Linger pouted, and said, &ldquo;What do you know, a person who is self-cultivation, body is the most important thing. My mother said, if you have a bad body, there is a supreme magic method, and it is also difficult to practice. Our Qingyun gate is derived from Taoism. It is extremely important to keep in good health and health, and the body of the Taoist practice is deep, the body is even more important. Let’s take the &ldquo;Sword Sword Royal Thunder True Secret&rdquo;, one of the highest magic in our Qingyun Gate&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s body shook and his face changed greatly.</p>
<p>Tian Ling&rsquo;er wondered: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan came back to his face, his face uncertain, and he said: &ldquo;No, nothing, I listen to how the name looks so good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Ling&rsquo;er glared at him and said, &ldquo;Of course it is great, but this is one of our Qingyunmen Zhenshan stunts. Few people can repair it. Listening to my dad&rsquo;s saying, to show this truth, we must use ourselves as a guide. Complemented by the divine weapon and sharp blade, it attracts the Nine Heavens Thunder and the magnificent divine power.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan sighed and said, &ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Ling&rsquo;er again said: &ldquo;Then you think, although there is a real way to protect the body, but how powerful is the god of thunder. Once the ordinary people come into contact, they will immediately turn to ashes. Although the practitioner is very deep in practice, if the body is not good, At one and a half, I was just afraid that I would be killed by Shen Lei first. What else do you say to be ridiculous?&rdquo; She glanced at Zhang Xiaofan and said, &ldquo;So my dad told you to do this homework for your own good. See if you are still one. Reluctant face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was shocked and quickly jumped up anxiously: &ldquo;Without this, I will never dare to have any sense of disrespect to Master, let alone have any reluctance. Ah, I have enough rest now, this Go, go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After picking up the hatchet, Deng Deng Deng took his steps and ran up the mountain, but the speed was not slow. Tian Ling&rsquo;er looked at his back, smiled gently, and followed.</p>
<p>Finally, he climbed to the hillside. Zhang Xiaofan was out of breath. Before seeing the bamboo forest, the big yellow dog didn&rsquo;t know when he was actually lying in front of the forest. When they saw them, they called &ldquo;Wang Wang&rdquo; here. After a few sounds, without getting up, he turned his head back.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan stayed for a while and said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so fast!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean rhubarb?&rdquo; Tian Ling&rsquo;er blushed and gasped from behind.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan pointed at the big dog and said, &ldquo;Is it called rhubarb?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Ling&rsquo;er said: &ldquo;Yes, don&rsquo;t underestimate it, it is very powerful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan murmured: &ldquo;That is, looking at its size, it is known that it has been raised for at least 20 years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Linger said: &ldquo;How can there be!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan said strangely: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s less than 20 years, Rhubarb will really be a tall man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this time, Da Huang barked hard at Zhang Xiaofan.</p>
<p>Tian Ling&rsquo;er said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m saying there are so few years. Er, I&rsquo;ll calculate it, it seems that the fourth brother has been there, that is seventy years, it&rsquo;s wrong, the third brother said he came The time is here, that is ninety-seven years. Ah!&rdquo; She suddenly called, startled Zhang Xiaofan, and quickly said: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Ling&rsquo;er said happily: &ldquo;I remembered that when I was an hour, my mother and father quarreled and talked badly, saying that you want to kill the yellow dog that the father raised from a young to a big stewed dog soup to drink and make him dad. After half a death, Rhubarb was so scared that he dared not go home for days!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was very surprised and said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t dare to go home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Ling&rsquo;er said: &ldquo;Yeah, Rhubarb has lived for many years, and has become humane. Knowing that my mother is terrible, she fears that she will be hurt by her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great!&rdquo; Zhang Xiaofan said sincerely, not knowing whether to mean rhubarb or admiring the teacher&rsquo;s means. He glanced at the big yellow dog more than once, and no one knew that the big yellow dog ignored it. He spurted his nose and shook his tail. He turned his head to his side and lay lazily on the ground.</p>
<p>The two had reached the bamboo forest. Zhang Xiaofan said to Tian Ling&rsquo;er: &ldquo;Sister, when I first arrived on Tongtian Peak, I also saw a big monster many times bigger than rhubarb. &ldquo;Kirin&rsquo;, is Rhubarb the same spirit beast?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Ling&rsquo;er walked into the bamboo forest and shook his head, saying: &ldquo;No, Lingzun is an ancient beast, a wild species, far superior to rhubarb, incomparable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the talk, she took Zhang Xiaofan through the forest, walked for a while, and came to a place with more thin bamboos. The black knot bamboo here is generally only the size of the wrist and very slender.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is it, you can cut one every day for the next three months.&rdquo; Tian Ling&rsquo;er was serious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only cut one so thin?&rdquo; Zhang Xiaofan said in surprise.</p>
<p>Tian Ling&rsquo;er snorted and said, &ldquo;You try to cut it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan nodded, picked up the hatchet and walked to a thin bamboo, looked up and down, and slashed it with a knife. With just a crisp sound, the hatchet was like a stubborn stone, and Zhang Xiaofan felt numb in his palm. The thin bamboo was chopped by him, leaned forward, and bounced back a moment later, Zhang Xiaofan couldn&rsquo;t dodge, and was beaten hard by the bamboo sticks on his head, painful, leaving a red mark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Giggle&hellip;&rdquo; Tian Ling&rsquo;er smiled and bent down, and said hardly after a while: &ldquo;You are here to cut, I&rsquo;m going to do my homework.&rdquo; Then he turned away with a smile.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan touched the place where his face was hurt, only to see where the bamboo was chopped, there was only a faint white mark, and he could not help but take a breath. This morning, Zhang Xiaofan faced the black bamboo here by himself, chopping, chopping, sawing, grinding, pressing, and folding. He used everything to his advantage. After two hours, the sun rose to midair, and his body Sweaty, hands and feet are sore and weak, and actually only made a small two-pointed mouth of this black bamboo.</p>
<p>At this time a song came, Tian Ling&rsquo;er hummed an unknown song, and walked back and forth, saw Zhang Xiaofan embarrassed, looked at the black bamboo again, shook his head, and raised his hatchet , Do slashing.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan quickly said: &ldquo;Sister, what are you doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Ling&rsquo;er said impatiently: &ldquo;Cut it for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan shook his head hard and gasped, &ldquo;No, thank you sister. But this is my homework, I&rsquo;ll finish it myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Linger snorted, pointed to the sun, and said, &ldquo;Do you know when it is now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was stubborn and gritted his teeth, saying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll cut it when it gets dark&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Idiot!&rdquo; Tian Linger yelled at him suddenly. Zhang Xiaofan was taken aback, and was speechless for a moment, only staring at the sister for a while.</p>
<p>Tian Ling&rsquo;er is majestic and majestic, quite angry, saying: &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t look at the time, and don&rsquo;t want to think about others. If you cut into the darkness, would you want me to accompany you to the darkness? If you really want to To fight for the tone, you should work hard every day in the future and try your best to do your homework in two hours, instead of self-satisfied saying what is cut into the dark!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the end of the talk, she raised and lowered her hand, and the sound of the knife broke through the air, &ldquo;splitting&rdquo;, the bamboo fell down in response, and Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s eyes straightened.</p>
<p>Tian Ling&rsquo;er glanced at him and said lightly: &ldquo;Go back.&rdquo; Then he walked outside the forest. Zhang Xiaofan was ashamed and ashamed in his heart, and made up his mind that he will work hard and do his homework in the coming day.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>When dragging his tired body back to the place where Dazhufeng lived, it was already noon, and Tian Linger walked behind Shou Jingtang without a word. Zhang Xiaofan was stunned for a moment, and moved hard to move towards his room. At the entrance of the corridor, he saw his brother Song Daren standing there.</p>
<p>Song Daren smiled a little at the corner of his mouth, and said, &ldquo;How is it, Junior Brother, are you tired?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofanqiang laughed and shook his head.</p>
<p>Song Daren saw his young age, but his temperament was quite stubborn, and he couldn&rsquo;t help laughing, accompanied him to go to the room first, said: &ldquo;There is usually hot water in the kitchen, you can go back and wash it yourself after you come back. I’m going to have a meal in a while, I’ll take a break first, I’ll come over and call you, we’ll have to do our homework after the meal is over.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was startled and said, &ldquo;Is there any homework in the afternoon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>After seeing such a big reaction, Song Daren froze for a moment, then woke up and laughed: &ldquo;Oh, I was wrong. In the afternoon, when the disciples of the main line are practicing Taoism, I will teach you some introductory Taoism from today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was relieved, and he was surprised and happy in his heart, and asked quietly, &ldquo;Brother, those Taoisms are very powerful, are they difficult to learn?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren smiled and said, &ldquo;The practice is deep, naturally it is extremely powerful. As for whether it is difficult or difficult to learn, it depends on everyone&rsquo;s qualifications. But it is not that qualifications are not too tight. You also listened to Master said last night. After all: Daohai has no boundaries, diligence is the boat. As long as you are willing to persevere and practice hard, it will be difficult and successful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan nodded vigorously.</p>
<p>At lunch on this day, it was not easy for Tian to ask Zhang Xiaofan about his homework. Tian Ling&rsquo;er added oil and vinegar to Zhang Xiaofan. He said that Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s face was flushed and he dared not look up.</p>
<p>Tian couldn&rsquo;t listen to his daughter&rsquo;s words, shaking his head again and again, and finally waved his hand, saying only two words: &ldquo;Eating.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian is not too lazy to scold Zhang Xiaofan, but in Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s eyes, he feels that Master cares about himself very much, but he does not do well. Master does not scold, and he is extremely generous, and he is a rare teacher in the world. He felt ashamed in his heart and dared not say much. He only vowed secretly in his heart that he would practice hard in the future to repay the teacher.</p>
<p>After the meal, Tian was not able to take his eight-character steps as usual, swayed twice, and then went back to his Shoujingtang. Other disciples went to Taiji Cave one after another, only Song Daren and Zhang Xiaofan came to the room together and said, &ldquo;Young Master, this school of Taoism has a very strong foundation. When you first start, I will teach you the basic Taoism first. After you remember it , Self-cultivation, if you have any questions, come and ask me, do you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan nodded again and again, a moment of excitement in his heart.</p>
<p>Song Daren&rsquo;s face was straight and he said rightly, &ldquo;I have something else to tell you: this is magic, deep and magical, demons, and many prying eyes. You need to make a big oath. Disciple, never pass it on to outsiders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan felt a little trance in his heart, but then he was sober, and there was a firm color on his little face, saying: &ldquo;Yes. The sky is above. If disciple Zhang Xiaofan reveals the secrets of the Qingyun Gate Dao Law in the future, he will be struck by thunder and die without a burial place. &quot;</p>
<p>Song Daren nodded with a smile, let him sit down at the table, first taught him how to meditate and meditate, then roughly talked about the body&rsquo;s meridians and energy movement, and finally passed on his first practice method of &ldquo;Tai Chi Xuan Qing Dao&rdquo; .</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tai Chi Xuan Qing Dao&rdquo; is the root of Qingyunmen&rsquo;s various magical techniques. It was Qingyunzi&rsquo;s comprehension on that unknown scroll two thousand years ago. The unrivaled and unrivaled supreme law.</p>
<p>There are three realms of Yuqing, Shangqing and Taiqing in Taiji Xuanqing Dao. The disciples under Qingyun Gate, including many intelligent people, can’t break through Yuqingjing throughout their lives, but Rao is like this, only at the top of Yuqingjing Practice is also rare in the world.</p>
<p>Among the Qingyun Gate, the number is close to a thousand people, but those who can break through the jade Qingjing and study the upper Qing realm are headed by the Taoist Xuanzhen, but they are only in their early tens. But only these dozens of people, Qingyun Gate is one of the strongest and deepest sect in today&rsquo;s cultivation. As for the legendary Supreme Realm of Taiqing, it is said that only the genius Green Leaf Patriarch who was not born that year had ever been repaired.</p>
