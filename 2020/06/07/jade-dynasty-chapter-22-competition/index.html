      <p>The monkey Xiaohui saw the man in front of him staring straight at him, his eyes were weird and furious, he turned up the monkey claws and grabbed the past. The man was caught off guard and almost caught his face. Fortunately, he responded quickly, and he tilted his head back, hiding from it when he could not let it go.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was taken aback, quickly stopped Xiaohui, and turned to look at the man. The man was obviously terrified, and he touched his face, and said in his mouth, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s dangerous, it&rsquo;s dangerous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan felt a little sad in his heart and said, &ldquo;This brother, I&rsquo;m sorry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the man didn&rsquo;t care, smiled slightly, and waved his hand: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay. I was negligent and forgot the&rsquo;Three-eyed Spirit Monkey&rsquo; (Note 1). I was grumpy and easily hurt people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan stayed for a while and said, &ldquo;Three-eyed monkey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man was taken aback and said, &ldquo;What, don&rsquo;t you know that this monkey is a three-eyed spirit monkey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan somehow said, &ldquo;What is the three-eyed monkey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man widened his eyes and looked up and down at Zhang Xiaofan, saying, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t even know the three-eyed spirit monkey, how could you raise it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan said: &ldquo;I used to cut bamboo in the bamboo forest and encountered it. I was hit by the pine cones several times, and then it came back with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young Qingyun disciple opposite looked as if his chin had fallen off, murmured: &ldquo;If you smash a few pine cones, you will come back, if you smash a few pine cones, you will come back&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan saw that he was strange, shook his head, turned and walked away, but unexpectedly did not take a few steps, the man also followed up, with a smile on his face, and whispered: &ldquo;This brother, oh, no, brother, you&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan saw that he was called by his brother for the first time in his life, and when he saw that he was at least 20 years old, he quickly said: &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t dare to be fooled. Just tell me anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man paused for a while, smiling all over his face, and said, &ldquo;Oh, Brother Shi is really approachable, ah, so, let me introduce myself first, the surname Zeng, cursive script, is a disciple of Feng Huifeng. I don’t know Brother Shi &lsquo;S name is&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan said: &ldquo;I am Zhang Xiaofan, a disciple of Dazhufeng, Brother Zeng Shushu, you&hellip; uh, &ldquo;Uncle&rdquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man froze for a moment, then his face turned red, and he smiled a little embarrassedly: &ldquo;Ah, I didn&rsquo;t deliberately take advantage of you. My book is a book, not my uncle&rsquo;s uncle. This blames my father, my mother Ben named me a hero, you said how heroic Zeng was, but my dad watched me as a child and read books, so he gave me a book on a whim, and it became a laughing stock for life, really.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan couldn&rsquo;t help laughing, thinking that this person&rsquo;s name actually had the same meaning as Brother Six. The previous sorrows were disturbed by this person, which diluted a lot, and he was a bit closer to him. Yi, said: &ldquo;Ah, Brother Zeng, you love reading?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu said with a smile: &ldquo;That is, I don&rsquo;t have to be humble. No one has read more books up and down the Fenghuifeng, but I read most of them as anecdotes, so strange, so often my father is half angry. Well, after all, do you really not know that this monkey is the&rsquo;Three-eyed Spirit Monkey&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan shook his head and said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I thought it was an ordinary monkey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment, as if he understood what he said, the monkey Xiaohui squatting on his shoulder suddenly &ldquo;squeaked&rdquo; and screamed, pulling Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s hair hard, so that Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s &ldquo;Oh, dead monkey&rdquo; was so painful.</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu had envious eyes and said, &ldquo;Ah, it&rsquo;s really smart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan said with pain: &ldquo;This dead monkey loves to beat people, do you still say it is smart?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu said: &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think it looks amazing, but with this spirituality, it is a rare spirit. Look at it, is there a small vertical mark on the forehead between its eyes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan turned his head and took a closer look. Sure enough, he found that there was a light-colored vertical mark under the gray fur. If he didn&rsquo;t look carefully, he would never see it. He couldn&rsquo;t help but admire Zeng Shushu&rsquo;s heart and said: &ldquo;You are so small It can be seen, great, great!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A serious book by Zeng Shushu: &ldquo;You must not underestimate it. I once read it in the &ldquo;Spiritual Beast&rdquo; of &ldquo;Divine Demon&rsquo;s Different&rdquo; (Note 2). The three-eyed spirit monkey is a psychic beast. Ordinary monkeys are no different, but the third spiritual eyes on the forehead will be opened after adulthood, and the spirituality will be wide open. Not only will they be able to understand the Five Elements Immortal Technique, but they will also be able to see things thousands of miles away. What about the eye monkey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan hugged the little monkey and put it in front of his eyes. He couldn’t believe that this monkey, who had lived with him for two years, had such a big beginning, but it seems that how it looks is ordinary. The fat and fat monkey is quite heavy in his hand. It seems that he only weighed a few pounds in Tongtian Peak for one night.</p>
<p>Monkey Little is distraught in his heart. Today, everyone is staring at themselves for a while. &ldquo;Squeaky&rdquo; screams nowadays, which is very annoying. Zhang Xiaofan made a grimace at it, tossed it casually, and threw it on Dahuang&rsquo;s back. Rhubarb was startled and jumped away. It was Xiao Hui who was relieved when he saw clearly. Xiao Hui danced to Zhang Xiaofan everywhere, as if he was demonstrating. He cried several times before he stopped. He leaned on Rhubarb, and after a moment his attention was attracted by the lice in his fur.</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu looked at Xiaohui enviously, then turned back to Zhang Xiaofan and said, &ldquo;Brother Zhang, are you also coming to Tongtianfeng to participate in the Seven Vessels?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan nodded and said, &ldquo;Brother Zeng, what about you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu said with a smile: &ldquo;Me too. I won the 33rd lottery yesterday. I don&rsquo;t know what number you are. Don&rsquo;t be so clever. We are today&rsquo;s opponents?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan also smiled and said, &ldquo;I am number one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu was taken aback, and said, &ldquo;Are you the disciple of Dazhufeng yesterday?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s face was red and nodded.</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu said with a smile: &ldquo;You are so lucky,&rdquo; he said in his heart, and then said: &ldquo;We will not meet until the final battle. It seems very difficult.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan smiled and said: &ldquo;I am practicing this, the first&hellip; Hehe, the second round was immediately eliminated, where else dare to delusion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zeng Shushu put out his tongue and said, &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;m afraid I can&rsquo;t even pass the first round.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two looked at each other and laughed. The two of them talked for a while, and from the distance came Song Daren&rsquo;s shout: &ldquo;Xiaofan, have dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan responded from afar, said a few words to Zeng Shushu, then ran over, and then Da Huang also followed up with Xiao Hui on his back. Running to Song Daren, the two walked forward. Song Daren said: &ldquo;Who were you talking to just there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan said: &ldquo;Oh, I just met a brother of Feng Huifeng and heard him say Zeng Shushu.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren seemed taken aback, and said, &ldquo;Zeng Shushu?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan surprised: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren looked back and said, &ldquo;That man is the only son of Feng Huifeng&rsquo;s first uncle Zeng Changzeng and uncle, I heard that talent is superb, and Bo Wenqiang Kee, the practice is very deep, it is a big hit this time. One of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was stunned and speechless for a while.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>After breakfast, all the disciples of Qingyun Gate came to Yunhai Square. At a glance, the crowd was crowded, shoulder-to-shoulder, and the popularity was prosperous, showing the prosperity of Qingyun Gate.</p>
<p>Above the huge square, only during the time that everyone was eating, eight large platforms have been erected, built of huge trees with thick waists, separated by more than ten feet from each other, arranged in a gossip orientation . At this moment before and after the audience is already crowded. Under the largest &ldquo;dry&rdquo; stage in the middle, a tall red standing tall with several people stood up, and the sign and name of the disciples who participated in the competition were written with gold inlays on the bowl. Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s name was very unsightly. It took the first place, and the opponent&rsquo;s column was empty.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan blushed and secretly looked at the fellows around him. The others all smiled. Only Du Sishu, the sixth brother, complained: &ldquo;Unfair, unfair, no&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo; A soft drink came from the side. Everyone was startled and turned to look, but it was not easy for Tian and Su Ru to walk with Tian Ling&rsquo;er. The disciples of Dazhufeng immediately referred to and said, &ldquo;Master, Master!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian nodded easily and said nothing, but Su Ru said: &ldquo;Wait a little while and start the competition. You have to be more upset, do you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Everyone said in unison.</p>
<p>Su Ru turned her head to look at Zhang Xiaofan, but Zhang Xiaofan saw Tian Ling&rsquo;er beside her maid, and saw that she seemed to be more beautiful than usual today, she was so energetic, she was full of smiles in her beautiful eyes. .</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s heart seemed to be stabbed with a needle, and he could not help but bow his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Xiaofan,&rdquo; Su Ru saw that the little apprentice looked strange, and came over and called.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan quickly raised his head and responded: &ldquo;Yes, Madam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru looked at him and said, &ldquo;Are you all right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan quickly shook his head and said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay, madam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru glanced at him again and said, &ldquo;Xiaofan, you have a lot of luck. You are in abundance today, but you should also pay attention to watching your brothers and sisters compare. This kind of opportunity is extremely rare. It&rsquo;s good for you. Do you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan nodded and said, &ldquo;Yes, madam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru looked at Tian Tian not easy, Tian Tian nodded, turned and walked to the stage, everyone followed, and gradually dissolved into the crowd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dang&rdquo;, a clear sound of Zhong Ding came back, echoed in the misty sea of ​​clouds, so that everyone&rsquo;s spirits were revitalized, and the originally noisy square suddenly calmed down.</p>
<p>I saw that on the huge stage in the middle, the figures of Dao Xuan Zhenren and Cangsong Daoren appeared. Dao Xuan Zhenren took a step, looked around at countless disciples under the stage, and said loudly, &ldquo;The test begins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said, as his sleeve robe flicked, the clock sounded again, &ldquo;Dangdang Dangdang&rdquo; resounded in the sky, Zhang Xiaofan listened to his ears, and suddenly there was a feeling of blood boiling. He glanced at Tian Ling&rsquo;er around him, but he saw Tian Ling&rsquo;er smiled, and he was eager to try.</p>
<p>He couldn’t move his eyes anymore, so he didn’t hear what Daoxuan Zhenren said on the stage. After that, the Cangsong Taoist came out and said a few words. Finally, there was a clear and pleasant Zhong Dingda Loudly, waking him out of his trance, only to realize that the competition has begun.</p>
<p>Sixty-three people are competing and the eight arenas are naturally divided into four batches. Among the first group of 16 people, only Da Lingfeng&rsquo;s disciples had Tian Ling&rsquo;er playing the game. On the western &ldquo;off&rdquo; stage, Da Zhufeng&rsquo;s people swarmed naturally.</p>
<p>Tian Linger&rsquo;s opponent was a disciple of Chaoyangfeng, whose surname was Shen Tiantian. At this moment, he jumped up and went to the ring. His figure was quite chic, and the audience was even more applauded. Zhang Xiaofan turned his eyes and saw that there were more than a hundred people in the &ldquo;off&rdquo; position, most of them were disciples of Chaoyangfeng. Even the first Shangzheng Liang of Chaoyangfeng was also watching from under the stage. There was a faint smile on his face, and it was obviously very important to Shen Tiandou.</p>
<p>Tian Yifan and others walked off the stage, and everyone at Dazhufeng was immediately submerged among Chaoyangfeng disciples. Tian was not easy and did not care. He glanced at Shang Zhengliang who was standing in the distance. Shang Zhengliang also looked at them. The two eyes met, as if there was a faint spark, but the two just smiled faintly. thing.</p>
<p>At this time, a disciple had moved chairs for the two first and Su Ru and other elders. Tian was not easy to sit down with Su Ru. Tian Ling&rsquo;er stepped forward and said, &ldquo;Dad, mother, I went up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian was not easy to look at his daughter and said: &ldquo;Go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru&rsquo;s face glowed with love, and he said, &ldquo;Be careful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Linger glanced at the stage, smiling, without any nervousness, and said, &ldquo;Wait for my good news.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said, as soon as he turned around, his smile remained, and his left-handed tactics cited: &ldquo;Get up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I saw that as her words fell, a burst of glowing light flashed, and the amber Zhu Ling in her waist had already been sacrificed, and moved to her feet, holding Tian Ling&rsquo;er slender, flying like a fairy in the glow, flying towards the stage go with.</p>
<p>This hand is naturally better than Shen Tiandou jumping on the stage like a monkey, and Tian Ling&rsquo;er is beautiful, and his disciples, including Chaoyang Peak, are mostly male disciples. The applause immediately thundered, and they even beat the audience in the distance. Many people looked back.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan and other disciples of Dazhufeng stood behind Tian Yizhu and Su Ru, only listening to Su Ru smiling and saying to Tian Tian: &ldquo;It seems that Linger&rsquo;s practice has been improved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian is not easy to smile slightly. Although he didn&rsquo;t speak, he was quite happy.</p>
<p>At this time, Tian Ling&rsquo;er had flown to the stage, one foot away from Shen Tiandou, and arched his hand: &ldquo;Brother Shen please enlighten me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shen Tiandou saw Tian Ling&rsquo;er driving up the treasure and saw the magical bursts of light. The immortal spirit was probably the most famous magic weapon &ldquo;Amber Zhu Ling&rdquo; of the elder Su Zhu who had been careful to be careful. Gongshou also ritually said: &ldquo;Please ask Master Tian to show mercy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that, he took a step back, and his right-hand sword trick was cited, and a three-foot fairy sword with a grayish-brown glow was sacrificed and laid in front of him.</p>
<p>Under the audience, Su Ru frowned and whispered to Tian: &ldquo;This sword, like Linger&rsquo;s amber Zhu Ling, is a five-elements magic weapon of the earth system. This will depend on their deep practice. &quot;</p>
<p>Tian Yijian smiled slightly and said, &ldquo;What can you compare with your Amber Zhu Ling among the Qingyunmen earth system magic weapons? In my opinion, the fairy sword is a thousand miles away from your Amber Zhu Ling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru whispered and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll talk nonsense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this time a bell sounded on the stage, and the competition between Tian Ling&rsquo;er and Shen Tiandou officially began.</p>
<p>Tian Ling&rsquo;er was obviously young and full of spirits, and the bells just rested. He immediately pointed his finger forward, and the gleaming light flashed in a flash, and the lightning flashed quickly. Amber Zhu Ling brought a strong wind, and his face was hurt, and he rushed to Shen Tiandou.</p>
<p>Shen Tiandou didn&rsquo;t expect Tian Ling&rsquo;er to say that he would hit it, and after seeing Amber Zhu Ling rushed over in a blink of an eye, he quickly retreated two steps, his hands shook, and the fairy sword in front of him immediately shined and greeted him.</p>
<p>Xiaguang and gray-brown light collided together in the center of the stage, only to hear a &ldquo;bang&rdquo;, Tian Ling&rsquo;er and Shen Tiandou&rsquo;s body flickered, but immediately stood firm, and the two magic weapons also stalemate in mid-air.</p>
<p>Under the audience, Tian easily frowned, and Su Ru was also surprised: &ldquo;Hey, Shen Tiandou’s practice is not low.&rdquo; At the same time, the disciples of Chaoyangfeng under the audience cried out in unison: &ldquo;Good!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The screams of these hundreds of people turned out to be extraordinary, and immediately suppressed the Dazhufeng people who were already screaming. The sixth elder Du Bishu snorted and said, &ldquo;Is the sound louder? Isn&rsquo;t it more than the voice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this time, on the stage, the two treasures froze for another moment, regardless of whether they were going up or down, and at the same time, they took it back together. Shen Tiandou stepped on the seven stars, his face was serious, and there were words in his mouth, and he immediately shouted: &ldquo;Ill!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I saw his gray-brown fairy sword rising in mid-air and rushed into the sky. After a while, lightning flashed from the top of Tian Ling&rsquo;er&rsquo;s head, and the sword wasn&rsquo;t reaching the ground. , Strong winds around.</p>
<p>Tian Ling&rsquo;er didn&rsquo;t panic and didn&rsquo;t mean to retreat. He grabbed the amber Zhu Ling flying back in front of his left hand and pulled it to the top of his head. Suddenly the light was like a gauze. The amber Zhu Ling instantly widened several times and weaved at the top of his head. A ray barrier. When it was too late, when Shen Tiandou&rsquo;s face was awkward, the fairy sword &ldquo;Zheng&rdquo; struck the Xiaguang again, and I saw that the red Xiaguang shook, but it was safe.</p>
<p>Su Ru was relieved and whispered to Tian that it was not easy to say: &ldquo;Lin&rsquo;er, this child is so kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Anhou snorted and shook his head.</p>
<p>Shen Tiandou&rsquo;s gray-brown fairy sword failed in a single blow and folded upward, but Tian Ling&rsquo;er didn&rsquo;t pause at all. Amber Zhu Ling Xia Xuanguang shone, ten times longer. Tian Ling&rsquo;er shouted, but saw Amber Zhu Ling changed the original The soft appearance turned into a long giant stick, straight in the air, one end caught in Tian Ling&rsquo;er&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>The audience was in an uproar, and the exclamation continued.</p>
<p>Tian Ling&rsquo;er didn&rsquo;t hesitate, he danced with his right hand, and saw that the giant rod turned into amber Zhu Ling swept through the air, and struck Shen Tiandou seriously.</p>
<p>Shen Tiandou&rsquo;s brows were scowled and his face was solemn. At this moment, his fairy sword had flown back to his hand, but when he saw him clenching his teeth, his right hand clenched the fairy sword, and the left hand stretched out. Seeing that the giant stick would hit him in the head On the stage, everyone under the stage held their breaths and suddenly made a loud noise. On the platform in front of him, the originally flat wooden platform burst instantly, and five or six giant rocks suddenly broke out of the platform and stood in front of him.</p>
<p>Under the audience, Tian Nan and Su Ru both slightly changed their faces. On the contrary, the first Shang Zhengliang of Chaoyang Peak nodded again and again.</p>
<p>Just listening to the loud noise of &ldquo;Boom&rdquo;, the giant rod with shining rays of light collided heavily with the rock, and the dust flew across the entire platform for a moment. Tian Ling&rsquo;er only felt that his body was shocking, and the opponent&rsquo;s &ldquo;Yuyanshu&rdquo; was indestructible. Amber Zhu Ling returned the whole article.</p>
<p>The dust hadn&rsquo;t fallen yet, and Shen Tiandou&rsquo;s face was slightly pale, but he didn&rsquo;t stop at all. There was a roar between his throats, his body fluttered over the huge rock, his hands held the sword handles together, the gray-brown fairy sword shone brightly, and suddenly inserted into the hard Among the extreme rocks, the momentum is like breaking bamboo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kaka Kaka!&rdquo; A few dull and hoarse cracks sounded, and Tian Ling&rsquo;er&rsquo;s face changed, only to feel that the ground under his feet was shaking, and suddenly there were several loud noises, and Tian Ling&rsquo;er stood on his feet All the wooden boards broke, and in the sound of rumbling, countless huge and sharp rocks came out of the ground, and the original Tian Linger&rsquo;s foot was pierced with incomplete skin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; Zhang Xiaofan shouted out of the audience, but immediately closed his mouth, and saw Tian Tian&rsquo;s and his wife&rsquo;s face also became serious, Su Ru was a little nervous. On the contrary, Chaoyangfeng&rsquo;s disciples applauded loudly and applauded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brother Shen, good!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;awesome!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must win!&rdquo;&hellip;</p>
<p>The shouts were one after another, and the stage was dusty at the same time, and it was almost impossible to see anything, but Shen Tiandou, who stood high above the giant rock, did not look relaxed, his eyes wide open, and he carefully searched around. Sure enough, a moment later, among the thick dust above the huge rock in front, the ray of light suddenly flickered, and the light radiated in an instant. I saw Tian Ling&rsquo;er like a red phoenix, Huo Ran flew out, and the amber Zhu Ling Xia Xuanguang circulated. Beside her.</p>
<p>Tian Ling&rsquo;er looked sober, Xing&rsquo;s eyes shot a cold man&rsquo;s eyes, his hands and tactics were held together, and then he swung down heavily, only to see that Amber Zhu Ling suddenly stopped suddenly, piercing like a poisonous snake straight into the ground, born from those hard Drilled into the rock.</p>
<p>Shen Tiandou&rsquo;s face changed drastically, without thinking, he immediately drifted back. Sure enough, just when he had just left the standing place, the amber Zhu Ling, who was originally like a viper, was now violently rushing out of the ground like a red dragon. Shen Tiandou just now Shafei stone walked at the standing place, breaking a big hole, the momentum was so fierce, it was frightening.</p>
<p>Tian Ling&rsquo;er was in the air at the moment, and he used his left and right hands to make the orchid recipe, crossed his chest, and sipped in his mouth: &ldquo;Bind God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amber Zhu Ling had a volley, a crisp sound, and the glow of the sun was magnificent, and the wind grew long. In a moment, he did not know how many times it grew out. It covered the sky and covered the sun, and quickly walked through, or when it was empty, or rushed into the ground. He broke out from the other side, centered on Shen Tiandou, countless Hongya surrounded him tightly in the circle.</p>
<p>Dazhufeng couldn&rsquo;t help but look at each other. She used this &ldquo;Bound God&rdquo; magic technique in the battle between Tian Linger and Lin Jingyu two years ago. Today, this &ldquo;Binder God&rdquo; is more powerful and heaven and earth. Surrounded all, I don&rsquo;t know how Shen Tiandou compares to Lin Jingyu in those days?</p>
<p>Just listening to the sound of Tian Ling&rsquo;er&rsquo;s mantra, Amber Zhu Ling turned into a huge red ball, and kept pressing inwards. In that gap, under the rays of light, I could still see the grayish brown light vaguely. Shen Tiandou still resisted stubbornly, but although the Dao Dao was resisted and slowed down, he still irresistibly pushed inwards.</p>
<p>There was silence on the stage, and Chaoyangfeng&rsquo;s disciples closed their mouths and looked nervously at the huge red ball on the stage. Everyone knows that under the weight of this fairy magic weapon, one can&rsquo;t support it. What will happen?</p>
<p>Hongya has now received a size of six feet. The glow of the gleaming light has completely suppressed the gray-brown light. From time to time, there is also a &ldquo;clucking&rdquo; oppression sound. At this time, everyone could not see Shen Tiandou&rsquo;s figure at all, and Tian Ling&rsquo;er still stopped in mid-air, his face flushed slightly, and the orchid recipe held in his left and right hands shivered slightly.</p>
<p>After a while, Amber Zhu Ling slowly pressed inward again, and the people were almost tense and breathless. At this moment, she only heard a strange cry, &ldquo;Shen Tian fights like a tiger. Shi Jian Po Ling rushed out, but now his face was completely pale.</p>
<p>The disciples of Chaoyangfeng under the stage shouted with joy, but the first Shang Zhengliang closed his eyes and sighed, while Tian Yi and his wife sitting on the other side smiled at each other.</p>
<p>Sure enough, this was Shen Tiandou&rsquo;s dying struggle. Tian Linger folded up in the air, with a finger in his right hand, and Amber Zhu Ling was like a cone of bones. He followed closely and slammed behind Shen Tiandou. But at this time, Shen Tiandou seemed to be extremely difficult to turn around. He moved a bit and did not hide. He was beaten gently by Amber Zhu Ling behind him, and the whole person flew forward, and fell to the stage with a bang. .</p>
<p>The disciples of Chaoyangfeng from the audience were half applauded, and suddenly looked dumb and silent. Shang Zhengliang stood up, shook his head, and shouted to the disciples beside him, &ldquo;Shall we help Brother Shen up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The disciples of Chaoyangfeng came to their senses and ran up to support Shen Tiandou. At this time, Tian Linger put away the magic weapon and fell to the stage. He smiled and said to Shen Tiandou: &ldquo;Thank you, Brother Shen, for showing mercy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shen Tiandou glanced at her, and smiled bitterly: &ldquo;Sister Tian Tiantian is a wizard, admires, admires.&rdquo; Then he let the people around him aside.</p>
<p>Shang Zhengliang walked over and looked at Tian Ling&rsquo;er for a few more times. He said to the Tian Tian couples who came: &ldquo;Brother Tian, ​​the niece is young, but he has such a talent for Xiuzhen. It is really enviable.&rdquo; .&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian was not easy to get a good look, but said with a smile in his mouth: &ldquo;Overwhelming, overwhelming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru also smiled and said: &ldquo;Brother Shang has a large number of talents. I believe there are still more powerful masters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shang Zhengliang smiled, Tian was not easy to ask, and turned back. At this time Tian Ling&rsquo;er walked back to Dazhufeng where everyone was, immediately surrounded by everyone, all the disciples smiled and smiled, and wished to speak out all the praises to drown Tian Ling&rsquo;er, only Tian Linger&rsquo;s brows and smiles, Zhang Xiaofan even more Is happy. Tian Yiji and his wife came back, and Tian Ling&rsquo;er flew to Su Ru at once, took her arm and smiled, &ldquo;How is it, mother, I am amazing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru gave her a white look, and after all she smiled and said, &ldquo;Great, great.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Nan was also full of smiles. After all, his daughter got a good start. His face was very bright. He raised his eyebrows and exhaled in front of the same door. He also patted his daughter&rsquo;s head with his hand and gave a reward. But then he turned his head and said to the other disciples: &ldquo;It will be up to you again, and Linger is leading the way. You can also see that other disciples are not necessarily unattainable. keep it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everyone said in unison: &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan also shouted with the crowd and shouted very loudly. Seeing that the others were preparing for each other, three people played in Dazhufeng in the next eight competitions, so Tian was not easy to watch with Su Ru, and when he saw Zhang Xiaofan was still there, Su Ru told a few words, &ldquo;go seriously After watching the words, Zhang Xiaofan thought about it, planning to find Tian Linger to find a ring with her to cheer for his brother, looking around, and suddenly I saw the crowd in front, Tian Linger quickly walked forward And, in front of her, Qi Hao, standing in front of Yushu Linfeng, was standing there, looking at her with a smile.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s heart sank immediately.</p>
<p>Tian Ling&rsquo;er walked to Qi Hao and smiled a few words to him, Qi Hao immediately smiled, and kept talking in Tian Ling&rsquo;er&rsquo;s ear, Tian Ling&rsquo;er also kept smiling, both of them looked Very happy. After laughing for a while, the two of them went away together, seemingly picked a ring to see and compare.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan stood in the same place, stunned, and only felt a huge sorrow and disappointment in his trance, all the boiling blood had cooled down, and it was cold to the bottom of his heart.</p>
