      <p>Zhang Xiaofan woke up wandering for a long while, slowly sat up, and the past was like a tide, and his heart surged for a moment.</p>
<p>A nightmare!</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wake up, that&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo; A voice came from the door and walked in.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan looked up and recognized Song Daren, who had been seen on Tongtian Peak at the time, tall and rude. In his current state of mind, somehow, seeing this acquaintance is somewhat kind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brother Song.&rdquo; Zhang Xiaofan called out.</p>
<p>Although Song Daren was a great man, he couldn&rsquo;t help feeling a little pity at the moment. He walked to the bed and reached out to touch Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s head, and said softly, &ldquo;Sister, don&rsquo;t be sad, we will be a family in the future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan stayed for a while and said, &ldquo;Which family?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren smiled and reiterated Tian Nanyi&rsquo;s acceptance of him as a disciple. Of course, in the Yuqing Hall of Tongtianfeng that day, he didn&rsquo;t know the little dispute between the elders of Qingyunmen.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan heard it, and was at a loss for a while. Qingyunmen was really a first-class person with a fairy in his mind like a farmer&rsquo;s child. He never dreamed that one day, he would also have the opportunity to enter Qingyunmen. However, this price is not what he is willing to pay.</p>
<p>He gritted his teeth, and after all he knew it would be useless, he opened his mouth and said: &ldquo;Brother Song.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren nodded with a smile and said, &ldquo;Good. Brother Xiao, you have been sleeping all day and night, maybe you are hungry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan didn&rsquo;t feel it yet, but when he said, his stomach suddenly &ldquo;cooed&rdquo; twice.</p>
<p>Song Daren said with a smile: &ldquo;Come on, Brother Xiao, let&rsquo;s go eat something first. By the way, I will tell you something about the situation, and then I will go to see Master and your mother together, and you have met other brothers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan nodded and got out of bed, only to notice that the room he was in was quite similar to the place where Qingyun disciples lived on Tongtianfeng, but it seemed to be more spacious.</p>
<p>In order to take him out, Song Daren said, &ldquo;Our Dazhufeng is no different from other people. The people are very thin. Even if you are added now, the total number is not more than ten, so the room is more spacious.&rdquo; When I walked outside, it was a similar small courtyard. I walked a few more steps and walked out of the courtyard, which was also a cloister. However, at a glance, there are only a dozen rooms, far inferior to the scale of Tongtian Peak.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan followed Song Daren toward the kitchen. He learned from his mouth that Dazhufeng&rsquo;s pulse has been from the four disciples under the young leaf ancestor Zheng Tong, and has been handed down to Tian Yi&rsquo;s hands for a total of six generations. Nowadays, in addition to the first teacher Tian Tian, ​​there is only another teacher Uncle Su Ru, who is also his wife. They have a female Tian Linger. At thirteen this year, they are two years older than Zhang Xiaofan, so Zhang Xiaofan is a veritable young teacher here.</p>
<p>Among the disciples of Tian Yi, Song Daren is a great brother, followed by Wu Dayi, Zheng Dali, He Dazhi, Lu Daxin, and Du Bishu.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan meticulously remembered: &ldquo;Oh, Brother Dayi, Brother Dali, Brother Dazhi, Brother Daxin, Brother Dashu&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren smiled: &ldquo;Brother Du Bishu.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was stunned for a while, and then he woke up and asked, &ldquo;How can this six brothers be different?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren said: &ldquo;Originally, he was really called Dashu, but you called twice to listen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan murmured: &ldquo;Du Dashu, Du Dashu, Uncle Du&hellip;&rdquo; He understood it in his heart and smiled immediately.</p>
<p>Song Daren also smiled and said, &ldquo;You know. Actually, Master doesn&rsquo;t care much, but Master Madam is very annoyed. After a few calls, Master Du doesn&rsquo;t respect Master and respects him. He has to take a lesson and scare Master Du. , And quickly asked Master and Mother to change his name. Later, Master and Mother took the name of &ldquo;Du Bishu&rdquo; for him. You can memorize this name several times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan whispered: &ldquo;Du Bishu, Du Bishu, gambling must lose&hellip;&rdquo; Pouting with a laugh, bent down.</p>
<p>Song Daren originally intended to make him laugh, slightly reducing his grief, and seeing Zhang Xiaofan happy, he was also very happy in his heart, and said with a smile: &ldquo;Six Masters had good gambling habits before they started. Later, by chance, they were transferred to the mountains by Master. Although he no longer gambles money, he usually loves to bet with others, and the teacher and the wife are also vigilant in this move.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s child&rsquo;s heart is full of smile, and his sadness is much lighter. Seeing that the brothers are so kind, the fear of fear in the future has gradually settled down.</p>
<p>Having eaten in the kitchen, Song Daren took Zhang Xiaofan to the &ldquo;Shoujing Hall&rdquo; in the main hall of Dazhufeng. The Dazhu Peak of Qingyunmen is crowded with people, and now they are all concentrated in the Shoujing Hall. Here, the red brick paved floor, the red tile stone pillar, and the lobby are carved with a big &ldquo;Tai Chi&rdquo; figure, which is generally very simple.</p>
<p>Two chairs were placed in front of the hall, two people were sitting, one was not easy for Tian, ​​the other was a quiet and dignified beautiful woman, she looked more than 30 years old, graceful and graceful, and stood beside her a little girl with beautiful eyes, a pair The bright and watery eyes are extremely clever and provocative.</p>
<p>As for the other five male disciples, standing in line, standing next to each other, either tall or short, strong or thin, all eyes at this moment fell on Zhang Xiaofan.</p>
<p>Song Daren walked to the hall and said in courtesy: &ldquo;Master, teacher and mother-in-law, the disciple brought the younger brother over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Hao snorted, quite impatient, but the beautiful woman Su Ruduo looked at Zhang Xiaofan and said: &ldquo;Daren, he slept all day and night, afraid that he would be hungry, you take him to eat something first Right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren said: &ldquo;Sister Hui, I have just taken the younger brother to the kitchen to eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Ru nodded, not easy to glance at Tian, ​​and stopped talking. Tian Zhuneng snorted again and said, &ldquo;Go ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan did not know why, so he only listened to Song Daren whispering behind him: &ldquo;Young Master, please kneel down and kowtow to the teacher.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan immediately knelt down, &ldquo;Dong Dong Dong&rdquo; nibbled a dozen heads, loud and loud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hehe.&rdquo; But the little girl Tian Ling&rsquo;er couldn&rsquo;t help laughing. Su Ru said with a smile: &ldquo;Good boy, just nine is enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan made an &ldquo;Oh&rdquo; sound, and then stopped, raising his head, and everyone saw a red on his forehead and couldn&rsquo;t help laughing. However, in Tian&rsquo;s eyes, Zhang Xiaofan was even more stupid. When he thought of teaching such idiots in the future, his seemingly big head seemed to be big again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay, let&rsquo;s do that,&rdquo; Tian was not in a bad mood, and waved: &ldquo;Daren, he will be brought by you first, and the school&rsquo;s rules and regulations, as well as some entry-level Taoism, will be taught by you first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren responded: &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; then hesitated and said, &ldquo;But Master, the younger brother is still young, this lesson&rsquo;s homework&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian was not easy to roll his eyes and said, &ldquo;I will do it.&rdquo; After I finished standing, without looking back, I walked to the back hall, and all the disciples bowed together, saying, &ldquo;Give me Master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian is not easy to leave, and has not waited for everyone to speak. The little girl Tian Ling&rsquo;er has flashed to Zhang Xiaofan and stared at him carefully. Zhang Xiaofan saw her lovely face in hibiscus shaking in front of her eyes, although young, but already It was a beautiful embryo. When he was in Caomiao Village, he had never seen such a beautiful girl of the same age and could not help but flush his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha,&rdquo; Tian Ling&rsquo;er, like discovering treasures, pointed at Zhang Xiaofan and laughed loudly: &ldquo;Brother, look, he will blush when he sees me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hall burst into laughter, Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s face was more red, Su Ru came over and scolded: &ldquo;Ling&rsquo;er, do not bully your brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Ling&rsquo;er made a grimace, but he didn&rsquo;t take his mother&rsquo;s words seriously, stood up straight, and said to Zhang Xiaofan: &ldquo;Hey, call me Sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan felt a sigh of relief, but when he saw Tian Linger&rsquo;s bright eyes in front of him, his posture was touching, and he was confused for a while, and he couldn&rsquo;t help but called out: &ldquo;Sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Ling&rsquo;er has always ranked the last place on Dazhufeng, and now he has a younger brother who is younger than himself. He is very happy in his heart. He is now old-fashioned and said, &ldquo;Good boy, younger brother, I will listen to my sister in the future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan Nana responded and said, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Surula passed her daughter and said, &ldquo;No mischief.&rdquo; He said to Song Daren, &ldquo;Daren, the younger brother is still young, so the homework may be a bit hard, you take care of him more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren Gong said: &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other five disciples stood next to each other, hehe, haha, gazing at each other, fortunately, the meaning of gloating.</p>
<p>At this moment, Su Ru suddenly made a very strange movement, like moving her muscles and turning her head in a circle, she was just so dignified. For a moment, the laughter of all the Dazhufeng disciples exhaled, and all of them were tongue-tied, the expression of catastrophe.</p>
<p>Su Ru cleared his throat and said, &ldquo;You&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sister-in-law,&rdquo; Song Daren was sweating on his forehead and screamed out.</p>
<p>Su Ru frowned and said, &ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other five brothers and sisters shared the same voice: &ldquo;Brother, what are you doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren anxiously said: &ldquo;Teacher, the younger teacher has just started, and the disciples are ordered by the master to teach him the rules and instructions and the introductory homework.</p>
<p>Su Ru pondered for a while and nodded, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the same as saying, go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; the five remaining teachers shouted in unison.</p>
<p>Song Daren laughed twice, without saying a word, stepped forward and hugged Zhang Xiaofan, not waiting for him to ask, and immediately walked out, saying in his mouth: &ldquo;Senior brother, let me find a secluded place, first teach you the rules of the door&hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>Tian Ling&rsquo;er followed with a smile, which was very interesting, only to hear someone behind him scolding loudly: &ldquo;Master, you are shameless!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;coward!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan listened to his ears and was puzzled, thinking how his brother taught me the rules of the door but was scolded as a coward?</p>
<p>He was thinking in his heart, suddenly Su Ru broke his drink, and his voice was cold and sweet, like breaking ice and cutting snow: &ldquo;Shut up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was quiet when standing in the hall.</p>
<p>Just listen to Su Rudao: &ldquo;You guys who can&rsquo;t do things, I&rsquo;m afraid of this kind of virtue as soon as I see me trying to compare your practice. In another five years, it will be the &ldquo;Seven Vessels will Wuwu&rdquo; of the Qingyunmen Yijiazi, the last time You have made me and your master half angry, and this time, if you don’t work hard, I will not be humiliated by the same door! Come on, let’s go together&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren ran faster and faster, strode meteor, and went straight back to the mountain after going out of the hall. Zhang Xiaofan lay on his shoulders, and the trees on both sides receded backwards, very fast. Behind them, Tian Ling&rsquo;er didn&rsquo;t know when to sacrifice a vermilion jade silk. The whole body was light amber in color, almost transparent, and exuded Tao Hongxia, which was obviously a magic weapon of the Xian family. At this moment, Tian Ling&rsquo;er stood leisurely on top of Hongya, and made a quotation in his hand. Then Zhu Hongyu Aya carried her to the sky and followed behind Song Daren.</p>
<p>When Zhang Xiaofan had seen such a divine thing, beyond his surprise, he saw Tian Ling&rsquo;er walking in the wind, very chic, and his eyes immediately showed a look of envy.</p>
<p>Tian Ling&rsquo;er saw his expression in his eyes and was very proud. He drove forward to Zhang Xiaofan and walked side by side with him, saying, &ldquo;How is it, am I great?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan nodded desperately and said, &ldquo;Yes, yes, you are so powerful, Sister, you can stand on the red cloth strip and run so fast!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Ling&rsquo;er stayed awake, and immediately realized what he meant by the red cloth. He was so angry that he couldn&rsquo;t help laughing: &ldquo;Big idiot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan was inexplicable, only listening to Song Daren laughing in front of him: &ldquo;Little Brother, what nonsense do you have, that&rsquo;Amber Zhu Ling&rsquo; is a magic weapon of fame practiced when the young lady is young. It is also a famous magic weapon of the immortal family, what is it and what is the red cloth strip?&rdquo; After laughing, he laughed.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s face was flushed, and she secretly raised her eyes to look at Tian Ling&rsquo;er. She saw that she was smiling at herself, and two small dimples appeared beside her face.</p>
<p>After running like this for a while, the three came to a hillside in Houshan, Song Daren stopped and put down Zhang Xiaofan. Tian Ling&rsquo;er also fell to the ground, and when the tricks were received, &ldquo;Amber Zhu Ling&rdquo; would automatically roll up if it was spiritual, and it would wrap around her waist, and it looked like a beautiful red belt.</p>
<p>The hillside is covered with bamboo, thick and thin, and it is very lush. However, when you look closely, the bamboo here is unusual and appears black at the bamboo joints.</p>
<p>Song Daren pointed to this bamboo forest and said to Zhang Xiaofan: &ldquo;Little brother, our big bamboo peak, the disciples who are new to getting started, come here every day to cut down bamboo. You are still young, every three months Cut a tree in the day, as long as the thickness is up to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Zhang Xiaofan heard about the introductory homework, Su Ru asked Song Daren to take care of it. He thought it was so difficult, but unexpectedly it was ordinary wood cutting. He was born in Caomiao Village and was born in a farmhouse. He also went up the mountain a few times with the grown-ups and cut firewood several times. At the moment, his heart was wide and he smiled and said, &ldquo;Master, I cut the firewood, don&rsquo;t worry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren looked at him, stopped talking, and said with a smile: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine. Let&rsquo;s walk back slowly, and I will show you the way. When you come by yourself, you will also talk to you about the door rules and regulations. .&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tian Ling&rsquo;er smiled next to him: &ldquo;Master, why are you running so far in a hurry and saying something unrelated to itching, you have to walk back slowly, afraid of being beaten by my mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song Daren turned red and ignored her. She only said to Zhang Xiaofan: &ldquo;Young Master, remember this, this is the first rule of the door. Respect the teacher first&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>In fact, in the vein of the Dazhu Peak of Qingyunmen, the first field is not easy to be lazy in nature. Although he has to face, he has always been too lazy to discipline his disciples. Generally, they only ignore Taoism after teaching it, and let the disciples practice it by themselves. But his wife, Su Ru, was stronger in nature and loved to use force. When he was young, his name was quite famous, and his scenery was very good. After marrying Tian, ​​his temperament had been greatly converged, but he was often itchy and unbearable. For the sake of enthusiasm, every time the Qingyunmen passed the &ldquo;Seven Vessels Meeting Martial Arts&rdquo; test, which was held as usual, the disciples of Dazhufeng had repeatedly defeated. In addition to the occasional victory of the master brother Song Daren, the rest of them After defeat, he became a laughing stock in Qingyunmen.</p>
<p>Su Ru&rsquo;s life is so strong, how to endure this breath, then often shots for his husband Jun Tian not easy to &ldquo;teach&rdquo; this group of disciples. Although her appearance was soft, her temper was anxious, and her cultivation practice was extremely high. She accidentally beat these disciples into a squirm and bruised her body, so that everyone feared that the glamorous teacher was far superior to the chunky master.</p>
<p>It was too late at this time, the sun set to the west, and the evening sky was brilliant. The setting sun shone on the Dazhu Peak, and the sophomore walked slowly towards the front of the mountain. In the distance, in front of the house, there was a long barking of dogs, and there were some pitiful cries of pain from some poor people.</p>
