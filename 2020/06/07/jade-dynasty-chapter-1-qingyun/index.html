      <p>The Qingyun Mountains are towering, the tigers are in the Central Plains, there is a big river &ldquo;Hongchuan&rdquo; in the mountain shade, and &ldquo;Heyang City&rdquo; in the important town of Shanyang. The geographical position is very important.</p>
<p>There are hundreds of miles of mountains in Qingyun Mountain, and the peaks are ups and downs, with seven peaks at the highest, towering into the clouds. On weekdays, I can see white clouds surrounding the mountainside, and I don’t know the true beauty of the top. Qingyun Mountain is densely covered with forests, waterfalls and strange rocks, and rare birds and beasts.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just more famous, but it is Qingyun Gate, a cultivation school on this mountain.</p>
<p>Qingyun has a long history. It has been more than 2,000 years since the founding of the school. It is said that the Kaipai ancestor was originally a river and lake master, and he was down for half his life, unhappy. When he was forty-nine years old, he traveled all over the world, passing Qingyun Mountain, and at a glance he saw that the mountain was full of spirits and spirits, and it was a wonderful place. Immediately climbing at the moment, dining style, drinking dew, practicing Daoist practice, it was not much. In a dense cave deep in Qingyun Mountain, I got a nameless scroll, uploaded all kinds of magic tricks, difficult and dry, but it is infinitely powerful and powerful. huge.</p>
<p>Xiang Shi got this adventure and concentrated on practicing. Twenty years later, little success was achieved, but out of the wind and rain, although it could not dominate the world, it became a hero. Then on the Qingyun Mountain, the school was founded and named: Qingyun. Therefore, in the scroll, close to Taoism, he dressed up as a Taoist, self-proclaimed &ldquo;Qingyunzi&rdquo;, and many later generations called &ldquo;Qingyunzhenren&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Qingyun Zishou is 367 years old. He received ten disciples before his death. He told him before his death: &ldquo;I have been studying for half of my life, and I am good at the art of feng shui. This Qingyun Mountain is a rare place on earth. I have a mountain in Qingyun. If there is this mountain, it will definitely flourish in the future, and you must never give up. Remember, remember!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that time, the ten disciples nodded one after another, convinced that Qingyunzi died. Unexpectedly, in the next 100 years, I didn’t know that it was God’s will, or it was simply that the Qingyunzi technique was not perfect. The Qingyun Gate not only did not develop, but it gradually declined.</p>
<p>Of the ten disciples, two died prematurely, four died in a vendetta against each other, and the remaining one was crippled and one was missing. After 50 years of this, there was an unprecedented natural disaster earthquake in Qingyun Mountain, the floods broke out, the mountains were shaken, and there were countless deaths and injuries. The only seedling left is limited to qualifications. The skills are low, and the scenery of Qingyunzi was no longer there. Instead, because of the ancient scroll, it attracted foreign enemies to fight for, and several bloody battles. If it were not for the powerful magic weapons of Qingyunzi, I&rsquo;m afraid the Qingyun Gate has been destroyed.</p>
<p>This situation has lasted for four hundred years. The Qingyun Gate has no improvement, and it can almost be described as &ldquo;Guoyan Residual Puff&rdquo;. In the end, he was even bullied to his doorstep. Among the seven peaks in Qingyun, except the main peak, Tongtianfeng, the remaining six were occupied by foreign enemies, including robbers and robbers, who used them as strongholds, looted everywhere, and ran wild. Uninformed people often misunderstand that Qingyunmen has fallen into such a state. Although Qingyun’s children have justified their defense, they also have the intention to kill the enemy, but they are weak and lamentable. I still remember that it was really the most tragic period of Qingyun&rsquo;s veins.</p>
<p>The situation did not change until 1,300 years ago.</p>
<p>Probably Qing Yunzi&rsquo;s physiognomy finally appeared, or he was tired from heaven, and he no longer made fun of Qingyun Gate. At this time, from the eleventh generation of Qingyunmen&rsquo;s descendants, there was an amazing peerless leader who had a brilliant leadership. Character &mdash;- Aoba Taoist. The surname of Ye Ye, who was originally a poor scholar, was talented and clever, but he failed to make repeated attempts. He had a chance, and was accepted as a closed disciple for the tenth generation head of Qingyun Gate, only 22 years old.</p>
<p>After the introduction of Aoba, within a year, he realized all the swordsmanship skills taught by No Fangzi and took the lead among the disciples. Another year later, even no prescription can only barely draw a tie with him by virtue of deep practice. Fang Zi was shocked and happy, and he took out the ancient scroll passed down by his ancestor and passed it on to Aoba to participate in his own auspiciousness. Aoba then closed the gate at the &ldquo;Magic Moon Cave&rdquo; at the back mountain of Tongtian Peak. It was only 13 years before this barrier was broken.</p>
<p>It is said that when he broke through, it was the night of the full moon. The cold moon hung high that night, and the whole Qingyun Mountain peaked like a day. Suddenly, there was a violent wind, and there was Long Yin and Chang Xiao in the back mountain, and the sound was shocking for hundreds of miles, and the listener did not change color. Later, there was a light purple auspicious light, rising into the sky, a loud noise, the hall of the Moon Moon Cave suddenly opened, the green leaves must be white, smiling, with a clear light, slowly came out, everyone was horrified, thought it was a fairy.</p>
<p>After that, Aoba officially became a monk, taking the name &ldquo;Ao&rdquo; of Qingyun under his family name of Ye, hence the name Aoba. He smiled at the same day and said, &ldquo;Master, wait a moment, the disciple will go out to do things, and he will return within a day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everyone was unclear. Therefore, one day and one night, the green leaves Yujian returned, and the enemy of the six peaks of Qingyun Mountain had already uttered all the fuss. Qingye Dao&rsquo;s humane law is strong, and the means are ruthless. For a time, the world became famous, and the Qingyun Gate was in full swing.</p>
<p>Another year later, Wu Fang Zi was about to pass the position of the head to Aoba, and he went to repair himself, and he no longer took care of the chores in the door. After Aoba took power, he worked hard to help his fellow students, carefully selected his descendants, and when he learned from the nameless scrolls, he had unpredictable powers. The Qingyun Gate has flourished since then. For fifty years, it has been the pillar of the right path, and after two hundred years, it has led the various schools of the right path.</p>
<p>Ao Ye, Gao Shou, died at the age of seven hundred and fifty. He was rigorous in his life and only passed seven people. He divided Qingyun Seven Peaks into seven people, so that the seven veins spread incense. Among them, Nagato resides in the Qingyun view of the main peak Tongtianfeng, which is the center of gravity.</p>
<p>As of today, there are nearly a thousand disciples under the Qingyun Gate, masters are like clouds, and their prestige is outstanding, and they are tied with the &ldquo;Tianyin Temple&rdquo; and &ldquo;Burning Incense Valley&rdquo; as the three major schools of the world. And the head of the Taoist Xuanzheng people, the merits of creation, the extraordinary saints, are even more peerless in the world.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>At the foot of the foothills of Qingyun Mountain, there is a small village called &ldquo;Cao Temple Village&rdquo; to the northwest of Fifty Miles away from the big city of &ldquo;Heyang&rdquo;. There are more than forty families living here, the folk customs are simple, the people in the village are more than a mountain of firewood to pay in Qingyunmen for some silver life. On weekdays, villagers often see the Qingyun disciples go up and down. They are as magical as they are. They worship the Qingyun Gate endlessly and think that they have won the Taoism. Qingyunmen has always taken care of the people around it, and it is quite good for the villagers here.</p>
<p>On this day, the sky was gloomy and the clouds were drooping, which made people feel breathless.</p>
<p>Seen from the village of Caomiao Village, the towering Qingyun Mountain lined up directly into the sky, the strange peaks and strange rocks, with a trace of peril.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that the villagers have lived here for generations. I have seen this scene many times, I don&rsquo;t care, let alone ignorant children.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stinky boy, where are you going to run?&rdquo; He screamed, with a little smile, from the mouth of a half-year-old child. He looked around ten years old, his eyes were beautiful, leading four or five boys and girls, chasing ahead Another child. The child in front of him was two years younger than him, and he was also shorter. At the moment, his face was full of smiles, and he ran forward, and occasionally turned back to make a grimace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zhang Xiaofan, stop when you have a species!&rdquo; the child behind shouted loudly.</p>
<p>The child at the front called Zhang Xiaofan yucked and ran while saying, &ldquo;You are my idiot!&rdquo; He said that he ran faster.</p>
<p>Running all the way, these children gradually approached the dilapidated grass temple at the east end of the village. From the outside, this small grass temple is dilapidated, and I don&rsquo;t know how many world winds and rains have gone through.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan rushed in first, but unexpectedly, he was agitated by the door panel, thumped, and fell. The children behind were overjoyed and hugged him, pressing him underneath. The handsome boy looked very good and smiled, &ldquo;I was caught, you have nothing to say next time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Who knows Zhang Xiaofan turned his eyes strangely and said, &ldquo;No, no, you secretly calculated me, how can you count?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy was stunned and wondered: &ldquo;When did I secretly calculate you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan said: &ldquo;Well, you are Lin Jingyu, dare you say that this door was not put here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The child named Lin Jingyu shouted, &ldquo;How can this happen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan pursed his mouth, tilted his head, and looked determined not to surrender or succumb. Lin Jingyu got angry from the heart, strangled his neck with one hand, and said angrily: &ldquo;If you say it well, you will admit defeat, do you agree?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan ignored it.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu&rsquo;s face was flushed, his hands were hard, and he shouted, &ldquo;Do you not agree?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan&rsquo;s trachea was choked by him, his breathing gradually became difficult, and his face slowly began to blush, but at his young age, his temperament was so extreme that he just kept silent.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu was getting more and more angry, his strength became stronger and stronger, and he said in a loud voice: &ldquo;Do not serve, do not serve, do not serve?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this time, the other children couldn&rsquo;t see right, and they all quietly shrunk back, leaving only the two ignorant children, in order to fight for their will, they insisted on each other because of their aggressive nature.</p>
<p>Seeing a catastrophe emerged for no reason, suddenly heard a buddha in the depths of this grass temple, someone said: &ldquo;Amituo Buddha, stop it quickly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A thin, thin palm came out in the air, stretched out two fingers, and flicked Lin Jingyu&rsquo;s hands. Lin Jingyu was shocked, and his body was shaken. His hands were released naturally.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan gasped, suffocating. The two of them were stunned in the local area. They recovered and remembered the scene just now. They looked at each other and became more and more afraid of each other.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyu said startled, &ldquo;Xiaofan, I&rsquo;m sorry. I don&rsquo;t know how&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaofan shook his head, his breathing gradually stabilized and said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay. Hey, who are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The children followed his eyes and saw that in this temple, an elderly monk was standing, with wrinkles on his face, a shabby coat, and his whole body dirty. Only holding a string of jasper rosary beads in his hand was actually crystal clear, dazzling, and gleaming light. Strangely, among the dozen or so sapphire rosary beads of the same size and smooth and clear, there is also a round bead of non-jade and non-stone, dark purple and dull color.</p>
